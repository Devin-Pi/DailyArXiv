| **[Why Is Spatial Reasoning Hard for VLMs? An Attention Mechanism Perspective on Focus Areas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01773v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) have long struggled with spatial reasoning tasks. Surprisingly, even simple spatial reasoning tasks, such as recognizing "under" or "behind" relationships between only two objects, pose significant challenges for current VLMs. In this work, we study the spatial reasoning challenge from the lens of mechanistic interpretability, diving into the model's internal states to examine the interactions between image and text tokens. By tracing attention distribution over the image through out intermediate layers, we observe that successful spatial reasoning correlates strongly with the model's ability to align its attention distribution with actual object locations, particularly differing between familiar and unfamiliar spatial relationships. Motivated by these findings, we propose ADAPTVIS based on inference-time confidence scores to sharpen the attention on highly relevant regions when confident, while smoothing and broadening the attention window to consider a wider context when confidence is lower. This training-free decoding method shows significant improvement (e.g., up to a 50 absolute point improvement) on spatial reasoning benchmarks such as WhatsUp and VSR with negligible cost. We make code and data publicly available for research purposes at https://github.com/shiqichen17/AdaptVis.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAA-SNN: Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02689v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, making them promising alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Notably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the static datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, our model exhibits improved performance ranging from 0.33\% to 2.80\% with fewer time steps. The code for the model is available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Regularized Principal Spline Functions to Mitigate Spatial Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05373v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new approach to address the problem of unmeasured confounding in spatial designs. Spatial confounding occurs when some confounding variables are unobserved and not included in the model, leading to distorted inferential results about the effect of an exposure on an outcome. We show the relationship existing between the confounding bias of a non-spatial model and that of a semi-parametric model that includes a basis matrix to represent the unmeasured confounder conditional on the exposure. This relationship holds for any basis expansion, however it is shown that using the semi-parametric approach guarantees a reduction in the confounding bias only under certain circumstances, which are related to the spatial structures of the exposure and the unmeasured confounder, the type of basis expansion utilized, and the regularization mechanism. To adjust for spatial confounding, and therefore try to recover the effect of interest, we propose a Bayesian semi-parametric regression model, where an expansion matrix of principal spline basis functions is used to approximate the unobserved factor, and spike-and-slab priors are imposed on the respective expansion coefficients in order to select the most important bases. From the results of an extensive simulation study, we conclude that our proposal is able to reduce the confounding bias more than competing approaches, and it also seems more robust to bias amplification.</p></details> |  |
| **[TS-CGNet: Temporal-Spatial Fusion Meets Centerline-Guided Diffusion for BEV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02578v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bird's Eye View (BEV) perception technology is crucial for autonomous driving, as it generates top-down 2D maps for environment perception, navigation, and decision-making. Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

| **[Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion: Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment and Spatially-variant Deformation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04309v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even though Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion (NRSfM) has been extensively studied and great progress has been made, there are still key challenges that hinder their broad real-world applications: 1) the inherent motion/rotation ambiguity requires either explicit camera motion recovery with extra constraint or complex Procrustean Alignment; 2) existing low-rank modeling of the global shape can over-penalize drastic deformations in the 3D shape sequence. This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024; The new version adds additional experiments and corrects typos</p></details> |
| **[Tera-MIND: Tera-scale mouse brain simulation via spatial mRNA-guided diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01220v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Holistic 3D modeling of molecularly defined brain structures is crucial for understanding complex brain functions. Emerging tissue profiling technologies enable the construction of a comprehensive atlas of the mammalian brain with sub-cellular resolution and spatially resolved gene expression data. However, such tera-scale volumetric datasets present significant computational challenges in understanding complex brain functions within their native 3D spatial context. Here, we propose the novel generative approach $\textbf{Tera-MIND}$, which can simulate $\textbf{Tera}$-scale $\textbf{M}$ouse bra$\textbf{IN}$s in 3D using a patch-based and boundary-aware $\textbf{D}$iffusion model. Taking spatial transcriptomic data as the conditional input, we generate virtual mouse brains with comprehensive cellular morphological detail at teravoxel scale. Through the lens of 3D $gene$-$gene$ self-attention, we identify spatial molecular interactions for key transcriptomic pathways in the murine brain, exemplified by glutamatergic and dopaminergic neuronal systems. Importantly, these $in$-$silico$ biological findings are consistent and reproducible across three tera-scale virtual mouse brains. Therefore, Tera-MIND showcases a promising path toward efficient and generative simulations of whole organ systems for biomedical research.

| **[An Efficient 3D Convolutional Neural Network with Channel-wise, Spatial-grouped, and Temporal Convolutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00796v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been huge progress on video action recognition in recent years. However, many works focus on tweaking existing 2D backbones due to the reliance of ImageNet pretraining, which restrains the models from achieving higher efficiency for video recognition. In this work we introduce a simple and very efficient 3D convolutional neural network for video action recognition. The design of the building block consists of a channel-wise convolution, followed by a spatial group convolution, and finally a temporal convolution. We evaluate the performance and efficiency of our proposed network on several video action recognition datasets by directly training on the target dataset without relying on pertaining. On Something-Something-V1&V2, Kinetics-400 and Multi-Moments in Time, our network can match or even surpass the performance of other models which are several times larger. On the fine-grained action recognition dataset FineGym, we beat the previous state-of-the-art accuracy achieved with 2-stream methods by more than 5% using only RGB input.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Influences the Field Goal Attempts of Professional Players? Analysis of Basketball Shot Charts via Log Gaussian Cox Processes with Spatially Varying Coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02137v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Basketball shot charts provide valuable information regarding local patterns of in-game performance to coaches, players, sports analysts, and statisticians. The spatial patterns of where shots were attempted and whether the shots were successful suggest options for offensive and defensive strategies as well as historical summaries of performance against particular teams and players. The data represent a marked spatio-temporal point process with locations representing locations of attempted shots and an associated mark representing the shot's outcome (made/missed). Here, we develop a Bayesian log Gaussian Cox process model allowing joint analysis of the spatial pattern of locations and outcomes of shots across multiple games. We build a hierarchical model for the log intensity function using Gaussian processes, and allow spatially varying effects for various game-specific covariates. We aim to model the spatial relative risk under different covariate values. For inference via posterior simulation, we design a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm based on a kernel convolution approach. We illustrate the proposed method using extensive simulation studies. A case study analyzing the shot data of NBA legends Stephen Curry, LeBron James, and Michael Jordan highlights the effectiveness of our approach in real-world scenarios and provides practical insights into optimizing shooting strategies by examining how different playing conditions, game locations, and opposing team strengths impact shooting efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[HanDrawer: Leveraging Spatial Information to Render Realistic Hands Using a Conditional Diffusion Model in Single Stage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02127v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although diffusion methods excel in text-to-image generation, generating accurate hand gestures remains a major challenge, resulting in severe artifacts, such as incorrect number of fingers or unnatural gestures. To enable the diffusion model to learn spatial information to improve the quality of the hands generated, we propose HanDrawer, a module to condition the hand generation process. Specifically, we apply graph convolutional layers to extract the endogenous spatial structure and physical constraints implicit in MANO hand mesh vertices. We then align and fuse these spatial features with other modalities via cross-attention. The spatially fused features are used to guide a single stage diffusion model denoising process for high quality generation of the hand region. To improve the accuracy of spatial feature fusion, we propose a Position-Preserving Zero Padding (PPZP) fusion strategy, which ensures that the features extracted by HanDrawer are fused into the region of interest in the relevant layers of the diffusion model. HanDrawer learns the entire image features while paying special attention to the hand region thanks to an additional hand reconstruction loss combined with the denoising loss. To accurately train and evaluate our approach, we perform careful cleansing and relabeling of the widely used HaGRID hand gesture dataset and obtain high quality multimodal data. Quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method on the HaGRID dataset through multiple evaluation metrics. Source code and our enhanced dataset will be released publicly if the paper is accepted.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Exact Bayesian Inference for Multivariate Spatial Data of Any Size with Application to Air Pollution Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02655v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine particulate matter and aerosol optical thickness are of interest to atmospheric scientists for understanding air quality and its various health/environmental impacts. The available data are extremely large, making uncertainty quantification in a fully Bayesian framework quite difficult, as traditional implementations do not scale reasonably to the size of the data. We specifically consider roughly 8 million observations obtained from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. To analyze data on this scale, we introduce Scalable Multivariate Exact Posterior Regression (SM-EPR) which combines the recently introduced data subset approach and Exact Posterior Regression (EPR). EPR is a new Bayesian hierarchical model where it is possible to sample independent replicates of fixed and random effects directly from the posterior without the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). We extend EPR to the multivariate spatial context, where the multiple variables may be distributed according to different distributions. The combination of the data subset approach with EPR allows one to perform exact Bayesian inference without MCMC for effectively any sample size. Additional motivation is provided via technical results illustrating favorable Kullback-Leibler and covariance properties. We demonstrate SM-EPR using a motivating big remote sensing data application and provide several simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Sparsity Methods for Compressive Space-Frequency Channel Estimation and Spatial Equalization in Fluid Antenna System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02004v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fluid Antenna System (FAS) unlocks unprecedented flexibility in wireless channel optimization through spatial reconfigurability. However, its practical deployment is hindered by the coupled challenges posed by high-dimensional channel estimation and real-time position optimization. This paper bridges wireless propagation physics with compressed sensing theory to address these challenges through three aspects. First, we establish a group-sparse recovery framework for space-frequency characteristics (SFC) in FAS, formally characterizing leakage-induced sparsity degradation from limited aperture and bandwidth as a structured group-sparsity problem. By deriving dictionary-adapted group restricted isometry property (D-GRIP), we prove tight recovery bounds for a convex $\ell_1/\ell_2$-mixed norm optimization formulation that preserves leakage-aware sparsity patterns. Second, we develop a Descending Correlation Group Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (DC-GOMP) algorithm that systematically relaxes leakage constraints to reduce subcoherence. This approach enables robust FSC recovery with accelerated convergence and superior performance compared to conventional compressive sensing methods like OMP or GOMP. Third, we formulate spatial equalization (SE) as a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, ensuring optimality through the branch-and-bound method. To achieve real-time implementability while maintaining near-optimal performance, we complement this with a greedy algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed channel estimation algorithm effectively resolves energy misallocation and enables recovery of weak details, achieving superior recovery accuracy and convergence rate. The SE framework suppresses deep fading phenomena and reduces hardware deployment overhead while maintaining equivalent link reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19764v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spike-based Transformer presents a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Transformers, achieving impressive results through sparse binary computations. However, existing spike-based transformers predominantly focus on spatial attention while neglecting crucial temporal dependencies inherent in spike-based processing, leading to suboptimal feature representation and limited performance. To address this limitation, we propose Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture that efficiently integrates both spatial and temporal information in the self-attention mechanism. STAtten introduces a block-wise computation strategy that processes information in spatial-temporal chunks, enabling comprehensive feature capture while maintaining the same computational complexity as previous spatial-only approaches. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing spike-based transformers without architectural overhaul. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAtten significantly improves the performance of existing spike-based transformers across both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101. The code is available at https://github.com/Intelligent-Computing-Lab-Yale/STAtten</p></details> |  |
| **[StarVid: Enhancing Semantic Alignment in Video Diffusion Models via Spatial and SynTactic Guided Attention Refocusing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15259v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) generation with diffusion models have garnered significant attention. However, they typically perform well in scenes with a single object and motion, struggling in compositional scenarios with multiple objects and distinct motions to accurately reflect the semantic content of text prompts. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{StarVid}, a plug-and-play, training-free method that improves semantic alignment between multiple subjects, their motions, and text prompts in T2V models. StarVid first leverages the spatial reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for two-stage motion trajectory planning based on text prompts. Such trajectories serve as spatial priors, guiding a spatial-aware loss to refocus cross-attention (CA) maps into distinctive regions. Furthermore, we propose a syntax-guided contrastive constraint to strengthen the correlation between the CA maps of verbs and their corresponding nouns, enhancing motion-subject binding. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods, delivering videos of higher quality with improved semantic consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis of Spatially Dense Gene Expression Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01347v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) measures gene expression at fine-grained spatial resolution, offering insights into tissue molecular landscapes. Previous methods for spatial gene expression prediction usually crop spots of interest from pathology tissue slide images, and learn a model that maps each spot to a single gene expression profile. However, it fundamentally loses spatial resolution of gene expression: 1) each spot often contains multiple cells with distinct gene expression; 2) spots are cropped at fixed resolutions, limiting the ability to predict gene expression at varying spatial scales. To address these limitations, this paper presents PixNet, a dense prediction network capable of predicting spatially resolved gene expression across spots of varying sizes and scales directly from pathology images. Different from previous methods that map individual spots to gene expression values, we generate a dense continuous gene expression map from the pathology image, and aggregate values within spots of interest to predict the gene expression. Our PixNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods on 3 common ST datasets, while showing superior performance in predicting gene expression across multiple spatial scales. The source code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[STGAN: Spatial-temporal Graph Autoregression Network for Pavement Distress Deterioration Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01152v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pavement distress significantly compromises road integrity and poses risks to drivers. Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential for effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement of traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually collected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse spatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing spatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to regularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel graph neural network model designed for accurately predicting irregular pavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data. Specifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain, creating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples and edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism. Furthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate pavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task, i.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed sequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism deployed by STGAN. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains pavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we demonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal correlations and addressing the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results further show that STGAN outperforms baseline models, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its novel modules. Our findings contribute to promoting proactive road maintenance decision-making and ultimately enhancing road safety and resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS)</p></details> |
| **[SPARTUN3D: Situated Spatial Understanding of 3D World in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03878v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating the 3D world into large language models (3D-based LLMs) has been a promising research direction for 3D scene understanding. However, current 3D-based LLMs fall short in situated understanding due to two key limitations: 1) existing 3D datasets are constructed from a global perspective of the 3D scenes and lack situated context. 2) the architectures of existing 3D-based LLMs lack explicit alignment between the spatial representations of 3D scenes and natural language, limiting their performance in tasks requiring precise spatial reasoning. We address these issues by introducing a scalable situated 3D dataset, named Spartun3D, that incorporates various situated spatial reasoning tasks. Furthermore, we propose Spartun3D-LLM, built on an existing 3D-based LLM but integrated with a novel situated spatial alignment module, aiming to enhance the alignment between 3D visual representations and their corresponding textual descriptions. Experimental results demonstrate that both our proposed dataset and alignment module significantly enhance the situated spatial understanding of 3D-based LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DELST: Dual Entailment Learning for Hyperbolic Image-Gene Pretraining in Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00804v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics (ST) maps gene expression within tissue at individual spots, making it a valuable resource for multimodal representation learning. Additionally, ST inherently contains rich hierarchical information both across and within modalities. For instance, different spots exhibit varying numbers of nonzero gene expressions, corresponding to different levels of cellular activity and semantic hierarchies. However, existing methods rely on contrastive alignment of image-gene pairs, failing to accurately capture the intricate hierarchical relationships in ST data. Here, we propose DELST, the first framework to embed hyperbolic representations while modeling hierarchy for image-gene pretraining at two levels: (1) Cross-modal entailment learning, which establishes an order relationship between genes and images to enhance image representation generalization; (2) Intra-modal entailment learning, which encodes gene expression patterns as hierarchical relationships, guiding hierarchical learning across different samples at a global scale and integrating biological insights into single-modal representations. Extensive experiments on ST benchmarks annotated by pathologists demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving improved predictive performance compared to existing methods. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/XulinChen/DELST.</p></details> |  |
| **[TEASER: Token Enhanced Spatial Modeling for Expressions Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10982v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D facial reconstruction from a single in-the-wild image is a crucial task in human-centered computer vision tasks. While existing methods can recover accurate facial shapes, there remains significant space for improvement in fine-grained expression capture. Current approaches struggle with irregular mouth shapes, exaggerated expressions, and asymmetrical facial movements. We present TEASER (Token EnhAnced Spatial modeling for Expressions Reconstruction), which addresses these challenges and enhances 3D facial geometry performance. TEASER tackles two main limitations of existing methods: insufficient photometric loss for self-reconstruction and inaccurate localization of subtle expressions. We introduce a multi-scale tokenizer to extract facial appearance information. Combined with a neural renderer, these tokens provide precise geometric guidance for expression reconstruction. Furthermore, TEASER incorporates a pose-dependent landmark loss to further improve geometric performances. Our approach not only significantly enhances expression reconstruction quality but also offers interpretable tokens suitable for various downstream applications, such as photorealistic facial video driving, expression transfer, and identity swapping. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that TEASER achieves state-of-the-art performance in precise expression reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025, code and demos are available at https://tinyurl.com/TEASER-project</p></details> |
| **[Modeling and Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Land Clutter Statistics in SAR Imaging Based on MSTAR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03816v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The statistical analysis of land clutter for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has become an increasingly important subject for research and investigation. It is also absolutely necessary for designing robust algorithms capable of performing the task of target detection in the background clutter. Any attempt to extract the energy of the desired targets from the land clutter requires complete knowledge of the statistical properties of the background clutter. In this paper, the spatial as well as the temporal characteristics of the land clutter are studied. Since the data for each image has been collected based on a different aspect angle; therefore, the temporal analysis contains variation in the aspect angle. Consequently, the temporal analysis includes the characteristics of the radar cross section with respect to the aspect angle based on which the data has been collected. In order to perform the statistical analysis, several well-known and relevant distributions, namely, Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma, and Rayleigh are considered as prime candidates to model the land clutter. The goodness-of-fit test is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence metric. The detailed analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the Weibull distribution is a more accurate fit for the temporal-aspect-angle statistical analysis while the Rayleigh distribution models the spatial characteristics of the background clutter with higher accuracy. Finally, based on the aforementioned statistical analyses and by utilizing the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, we perform target detection in land clutter. The overall verification of the analysis is performed by exploiting the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data-set, which has been collected in spotlight mode at X-band, and the results are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.02155</p></details> |

Our approach leverages differentiable neural rendering on multi-view images to endow a vanilla Vision Transformer (ViT) with intrinsic spatial understanding. We present the most comprehensive evaluation of embodied representation learning to date, covering 268 tasks across 8 simulators with diverse policies in both single-task and language-conditioned multi-task scenarios. The results are compelling: SPA consistently outperforms more than 10 state-of-the-art representation methods, including those specifically designed for embodied AI, vision-centric tasks, and multi-modal applications, while using less training data. Furthermore, we conduct a series of real-world experiments to confirm its effectiveness in practical scenarios. These results highlight the critical role of 3D spatial awareness for embodied representation learning. Our strongest model takes more than 6000 GPU hours to train and we are committed to open-sourcing all code and model weights to foster future research in embodied representation learning.

| **[Bayesian Inference for Spatial-temporal Non-Gaussian Data Using Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04655v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analysing non-Gaussian spatial-temporal data typically requires introducing spatial dependence in generalised linear models through the link function of an exponential family distribution. However, unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise an approach that obviates these issues by exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some fixed process parameters. More specifically, we expand upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors to achieve analytically tractable posterior inference for spatially-temporally varying regression models conditional on some kernel parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference from these individual posterior distributions over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with fully Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo and apply our proposed method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Marginally interpretable spatial logistic regression with bridge processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04744v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In including random effects to account for dependent observations, the odds ratio interpretation of logistic regression coefficients is changed from population-averaged to subject-specific. This is unappealing in many applications, motivating a rich literature on methods that maintain the marginal logistic regression structure without random effects, such as generalized estimating equations. However, for spatial data, random effect approaches are appealing in providing a full probabilistic characterization of the data that can be used for prediction. We propose a new class of spatial logistic regression models that maintain both population-averaged and subject-specific interpretations through a novel class of bridge processes for spatial random effects. These processes are shown to have appealing computational and theoretical properties, including a scale mixture of normal representation. The new methodology is illustrated with simulations and an analysis of childhood malaria prevalence data in the Gambia.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Posterior Estimation for Cataloging Astronomical Images with Spatially Varying Backgrounds and Point Spread Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00156v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural posterior estimation (NPE), a type of amortized variational inference, is a computationally efficient means of constructing probabilistic catalogs of light sources from astronomical images. To date, NPE has not been used to perform inference in models with spatially varying covariates. However, ground-based astronomical images have spatially varying sky backgrounds and point spread functions (PSFs), and accounting for this variation is essential for constructing accurate catalogs of imaged light sources. In this work, we introduce a method of performing NPE with spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs. In this method, we generate synthetic catalogs and semi-synthetic images for these catalogs using randomly sampled PSF and background estimates from existing surveys. Using this data, we train a neural network, which takes an astronomical image and representations of its background and PSF as input, to output a probabilistic catalog. Our experiments with Sloan Digital Sky Survey data demonstrate the effectiveness of NPE in the presence of spatially varying backgrounds and PSFs for light source detection, star/galaxy separation, and flux measurement.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPHERE: Unveiling Spatial Blind Spots in Vision-Language Models Through Hierarchical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12693v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current vision-language models may grasp basic spatial cues and simple directions (e.g. left, right, front, back), but struggle with the multi-dimensional spatial reasoning necessary for human-like understanding and real-world applications. To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework supported by a new human-annotated dataset. SPHERE systematically probes models across increasing levels of complexity, from fundamental skills to multi-skill integration and high-level reasoning that combines spatial, visual, and logical understanding. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art models reveals significant deficiencies, especially in reasoning about distance and proximity, understanding both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and applying spatial logic in physical contexts. These findings expose critical blind spots in existing models and underscore the need for more advanced spatial reasoning techniques, driving the development of vision-language models that align more closely with human spatial cognition. The SPHERE benchmark is available at https://github.com/zwenyu/SPHERE-VLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning with Denoising Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21075v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Spatial Reasoning Models (SRMs), a framework to perform reasoning over sets of continuous variables via denoising generative models. SRMs infer continuous representations on a set of unobserved variables, given observations on observed variables. Current generative models on spatial domains, such as diffusion and flow matching models, often collapse to hallucination in case of complex distributions. To measure this, we introduce a set of benchmark tasks that test the quality of complex reasoning in generative models and can quantify hallucination. The SRM framework allows to report key findings about importance of sequentialization in generation, the associated order, as well as the sampling strategies during training. It demonstrates, for the first time, that order of generation can successfully be predicted by the denoising network itself. Using these findings, we can increase the accuracy of specific reasoning tasks from <1% to >50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://geometric-rl.mpi-inf.mpg.de/srm/</p></details> |

With our approach, that uses consistently matrices on ${\mathbb C}^N$ instead of operators on $L^2$, we circumvent a variety of analytical subtleties in the analysis of the original nlQDD equation, e.g. related to positivity of densities or to the quantum exponential function. Our starting point is spatially discretized quantum Boltzmann equation with a BGK-type collision kernel, from which we derive the discretized nlQDD model in the diffusive limit. Then we verify that solutions dissipate the von-Neumann entropy, which is a known key property of the original nlQDD, and prove global existence of positive solutions, which seems to be a particular feature of the discretization. Our main result concerns convergence of the scheme: discrete solutions converge -- locally uniformly with respect to space and time -- to classical solutions of the the original nlQDD model on any time interval $[0,T)$ on which the latter remain positive. In particular, this extends the existence theory for nlQDD, that has been established only for initial data close to equilibrium so far.</p></details> | 42 pages, no figures |

In these scenarios, robots rely on a multitude of state-of-the-art detectors usually designed to operate with RGB-D cameras or expensive 3D LiDARs. However, most commercially available service robots are equipped with cameras with a narrow field of view, making them blind when a user is approaching from other directions, or inexpensive 1D LiDARs whose readings are difficult to interpret. To address these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach to detect humans and estimate their 2D pose from 1D LiDAR data, using detections from an RGB-D camera as a supervision source. Our approach aims to provide service robots with spatial awareness of nearby humans. After training on 70 minutes of data autonomously collected in two environments, our model is capable of detecting humans omnidirectionally from 1D LiDAR data in a novel environment, with 71% precision and 80% recall, while retaining an average absolute error of 13 cm in distance and 44{\deg} in orientation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MagNet: Multi-Level Attention Graph Network for Predicting High-Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21011v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics (ST) offers new opportunities to explore the gene expression patterns within the spatial microenvironment. Current research integrates pathological images to infer gene expression, addressing the high costs and time-consuming processes to generate spatial transcriptomics data. However, as spatial transcriptomics resolution continues to improve, existing methods remain primarily focused on gene expression prediction at low-resolution spot levels. These methods face significant challenges, especially the information bottleneck, when they are applied to high-resolution HD data. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces MagNet, a multi-level attention graph network designed for accurate prediction of high-resolution HD data. MagNet employs cross-attention layers to integrate features from multi-resolution image patches hierarchically and utilizes a GAT-Transformer module to aggregate neighborhood information. By integrating multilevel features, MagNet overcomes the limitations posed by low-resolution inputs in predicting high-resolution gene expression. We systematically evaluated MagNet and existing ST prediction models on both a private spatial transcriptomics dataset and a public dataset at three different resolution levels. The results demonstrate that MagNet achieves state-of-the-art performance at both spot level and high-resolution bin levels, providing a novel methodology and benchmark for future research and applications in high-resolution HD-level spatial transcriptomics.

| **[Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for Person Identification via Natural Conversational Keypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20803v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the age of AI-driven generative technologies, traditional biometric recognition systems face unprecedented challenges, particularly from sophisticated deepfake and face reenactment techniques. In this study, we propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations, which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies: a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly improving performance to 94.86%. By jointly modeling both static anatomical relationships and dynamic movement patterns, our approach learns comprehensive identity signatures that are more robust to spoofing than traditional appearance-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling the Spatially Varying Non-Linear Effects of Heat Exposure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20745v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exposure to high ambient temperatures is a significant driver of preventable mortality, with non-linear health effects and elevated risks in specific regions. To capture this complexity and account for spatial dependencies across small areas, we propose a Bayesian framework that integrates non-linear functions with the Besag, York, and Mollie (BYM2) model. Applying this framework to all-cause mortality data in Switzerland, we quantified spatial inequalities in heat-related mortality. We retrieved daily all-cause mortality at small areas (2,145 municipalities) for people older than 65 years from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health and daily mean temperature at 1km$\times$1km grid from the Swiss Federal Office of Meteorology. By fully propagating uncertainties, we derived key epidemiological metrics, including heat-related excess mortality and minimum mortality temperature (MMT). Heat-related excess mortality rates were higher in northern Switzerland, while lower MMTs were observed in mountainous regions. Further, we explored the role of the proportion of individuals older than 85 years, green space, average temperature, deprivation, urbanicity, and language regions in explaining these discrepancies. We found that spatial disparities in heat-related excess mortality were primarily driven by population age distribution, green space, and vulnerabilities associated with elevated temperature exposure.</p></details> |  |

We employ a stochastic sampling design that can flexibly generate irregularly spaced sampling sites, encompassing both pure increasing and mixed increasing domain frameworks. Specifically, we focus on a spatial trend regression model and a nonparametric regression model with spatially dependent covariates. For these models, we investigate $L^2$-penalized series estimation of the trend and regression functions. We establish uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and multivariate central limit theorems for general series estimators as main results. Additionally, we show that spline and wavelet series estimators achieve optimal uniform and $L^2$ convergence rates and propose methods for constructing confidence intervals for these estimators. Finally, we demonstrate that our dependence structure conditions on the underlying spatial processes cover a broad class of random fields, including L\'evy-driven continuous autoregressive and moving average random fields.</p></details> | 54 pages, 1 figure |
| **[STPro: Spatial and Temporal Progressive Learning for Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20678v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work we study Weakly Supervised Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (WSTVG), a challenging task of localizing subjects spatio-temporally in videos using only textual queries and no bounding box supervision. Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |
| **[GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154v5)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D manipulation tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation.

These convergence rates significantly improve the best-known convergence rates of fully discrete collocation approximation and with some logarithm factors coincide with the convergence rates of best $n$-term approximation. These results are obtained as consequences of general results on multi-level linear sampling recovery by extended least squares algorithms in abstract Bochner spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Show and Tell: Visually Explainable Deep Neural Nets via Spatially-Aware Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20134v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep neural networks have now reached human-level performance across a variety of tasks. However, unlike humans they lack the ability to explain their decisions by showing where and telling what concepts guided them. In this work, we present a unified framework for transforming any vision neural network into a spatially and conceptually interpretable model. We introduce a spatially-aware concept bottleneck layer that projects "black-box" features of pre-trained backbone models into interpretable concept maps, without requiring human labels. By training a classification layer over this bottleneck, we obtain a self-explaining model that articulates which concepts most influenced its prediction, along with heatmaps that ground them in the input image. Accordingly, we name this method "Spatially-Aware and Label-Free Concept Bottleneck Model" (SALF-CBM). Our results show that the proposed SALF-CBM: (1) Outperforms non-spatial CBM methods, as well as the original backbone, on a variety of classification tasks; (2) Produces high-quality spatial explanations, outperforming widely used heatmap-based methods on a zero-shot segmentation task; (3) Facilitates model exploration and debugging, enabling users to query specific image regions and refine the model's decisions by locally editing its concept maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06680v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12961v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

We propose Spatial Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Spatial-RAG), a framework that extends RAG to spatial tasks by integrating sparse spatial retrieval (spatial databases) and dense semantic retrieval (LLM-based similarity). A multi-objective ranking strategy balances spatial constraints and semantic relevance, while an LLM-guided generator ensures coherent responses. Experiments on a real-world tourism dataset show that Spatial-RAG significantly improves spatial question answering, bridging the gap between LLMs and spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Spectral Diffusion Contrastive Representation Network for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19699v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although efficient extraction of discriminative spatial-spectral features is critical for hyperspectral images classification (HSIC), it is difficult to achieve these features due to factors such as the spatial-spectral heterogeneity and noise effect. This paper presents a Spatial-Spectral Diffusion Contrastive Representation Network (DiffCRN), based on denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) combined with contrastive learning (CL) for HSIC, with the following characteristics. First,to improve spatial-spectral feature representation, instead of adopting the UNets-like structure which is widely used for DDPM, we design a novel staged architecture with spatial self-attention denoising module (SSAD) and spectral group self-attention denoising module (SGSAD) in DiffCRN with improved efficiency for spectral-spatial feature learning. Second, to improve unsupervised feature learning efficiency, we design new DDPM model with logarithmic absolute error (LAE) loss and CL that improve the loss function effectiveness and increase the instance-level and inter-class discriminability. Third, to improve feature selection, we design a learnable approach based on pixel-level spectral angle mapping (SAM) for the selection of time steps in the proposed DDPM model in an adaptive and automatic manner. Last, to improve feature integration and classification, we design an Adaptive weighted addition modul (AWAM) and Cross time step Spectral-Spatial Fusion Module (CTSSFM) to fuse time-step-wise features and perform classification. Experiments conducted on widely used four HSI datasets demonstrate the improved performance of the proposed DiffCRN over the classical backbone models and state-of-the-art GAN, transformer models and other pretrained methods. The source code and pre-trained model will be made available publicly.</p></details> |  |

However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up.

Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |

Inspired by quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics methods, we present ML-MIX, an efficient and flexible LAMMPS package for accelerating simulations by spatially mixing interatomic potentials of different complexities. Through constrained linear fitting, we show it is possible to generate a 'cheap' approximate model which closely matches an 'expensive' reference in relevant regions of configuration space. We demonstrate the capability of ML-MIX through case-studies in Si, Fe, and W-He systems, achieving up to an 11x speedup on 8,000 atom systems without sacrificing accuracy on static and dynamic quantities, including calculation of minimum energy paths and dynamical simulations of defect diffusion. For larger domain sizes, we show that the achievable speedup of ML-MIX simulations is limited only by the relative speed of the cheap potential over the expensive potential. The ease of use and flexible nature of this method will extend the practical reach of MLIPs throughout computational materials science, enabling parsimonious application to large spatial and temporal domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 13 figures.

Previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation rely on predictions of cross-modal information in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions of geometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we propose ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3D segmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should be consistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregates consecutive frames in a sliding-window manner and constructs Spatial-Temporal (ST) voxels to capture temporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering out ST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for each point and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictions among both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Considering the prediction consistency might vary under different sliding windows, we further propose Latte++ which leverages ST voxels generated under various sliding windows to more thoroughly evaluate intra-modal prediction consistency before the cross-modal fusion. Experimental results show that both Latte and Latte++ achieve state-of-the-art performance on five MM-TTA benchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods. Code will be available at https://github.com/AronCao49/Latte-plusplus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Validating uncertainty propagation approaches for two-stage Bayesian spatial models using simulation-based calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18962v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work tackles the problem of uncertainty propagation in two-stage Bayesian models, with a focus on spatial applications. A two-stage modeling framework has the advantage of being more computationally efficient than a fully Bayesian approach when the first-stage model is already complex in itself, and avoids the potential problem of unwanted feedback effects. Two ways of doing two-stage modeling are the crude plug-in method and the posterior sampling method. The former ignores the uncertainty in the first-stage model, while the latter can be computationally expensive. This paper validates the two aforementioned approaches and proposes a new approach to do uncertainty propagation, which we call the $\mathbf{Q}$ uncertainty method, implemented using the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA). We validate the different approaches using the simulation-based calibration method, which tests the self-consistency property of Bayesian models. Results show that the crude plug-in method underestimates the true posterior uncertainty in the second-stage model parameters, while the resampling approach and the proposed method are correct. We illustrate the approaches in a real life data application which aims to link relative humidity and Dengue cases in the Philippines for August 2018.</p></details> |  |
| **[DualSpec: Text-to-spatial-audio Generation via Dual-Spectrogram Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18952v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-audio (TTA), which generates audio signals from textual descriptions, has received huge attention in recent years. However, recent works focused on text to monaural audio only. As we know, spatial audio provides more immersive auditory experience than monaural audio, e.g. in virtual reality. To address this issue, we propose a text-to-spatial-audio (TTSA) generation framework named DualSpec.Specifically, it first trains variational autoencoders (VAEs) for extracting the latent acoustic representations from sound event audio. Then, given text that describes sound events and event directions, the proposed method uses the encoder of a pretrained large language model to transform the text into text features. Finally, it trains a diffusion model from the latent acoustic representations and text features for the spatial audio generation. In the inference stage, only the text description is needed to generate spatial audio. Particularly, to improve the synthesis quality and azimuth accuracy of the spatial sound events simultaneously, we propose to use two kinds of acoustic features. One is the Mel spectrograms which is good for improving the synthesis quality, and the other is the short-time Fourier transform spectrograms which is good at improving the azimuth accuracy. We provide a pipeline of constructing spatial audio dataset with text prompts, for the training of the VAEs and diffusion model. We also introduce new spatial-aware evaluation metrics to quantify the azimuth errors of the generated spatial audio recordings. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can generate spatial audio with high directional and event consistency.</p></details> |  |

With this in mind, we propose a new chat-paradigm \textbf{M}ulti-scene Video Abnormal Event Extraction and Localization (M-VAE) task, aiming to extract the abnormal event quadruples (i.e., subject, event type, object, scene) and localize such event. Further, this paper believes that this new task faces two key challenges, i.e., global-local spatial modeling and global-local spatial balancing. To this end, this paper proposes a Global-local Spatial-sensitive Large Language Model (LLM) named Sherlock, i.e., acting like Sherlock Holmes to track down the criminal events, for this M-VAE task. Specifically, this model designs a Global-local Spatial-enhanced MoE (GSM) module and a Spatial Imbalance Regulator (SIR) to address the two challenges respectively. Extensive experiments on our M-VAE instruction dataset show the significant advantages of Sherlock over several advanced Video-LLMs. This justifies the importance of global-local spatial information for the M-VAE task and the effectiveness of Sherlock in capturing such information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Both Ears Wide Open: Towards Language-Driven Spatial Audio Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10676v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion models have achieved great success in mono-channel audio generation. However, when it comes to stereo audio generation, the soundscapes often have a complex scene of multiple objects and directions. Controlling stereo audio with spatial contexts remains challenging due to high data costs and unstable generative models. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to address these issues. We first construct a large-scale, simulation-based, and GPT-assisted dataset, BEWO-1M, with abundant soundscapes and descriptions even including moving and multiple sources. Beyond text modality, we have also acquired a set of images and rationally paired stereo audios through retrieval to advance multimodal generation. Existing audio generation models tend to generate rather random and indistinct spatial audio. To provide accurate guidance for Latent Diffusion Models, we introduce the SpatialSonic model utilizing spatial-aware encoders and azimuth state matrices to reveal reasonable spatial guidance. By leveraging spatial guidance, our model not only achieves the objective of generating immersive and controllable spatial audio from text but also extends to other modalities as the pioneer attempt. Finally, under fair settings, we conduct subjective and objective evaluations on simulated and real-world data to compare our approach with prevailing methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its capability to generate spatial audio that adheres to physical rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, we define a differentially private Poisson point synthesizer (PPS) and Cox point synthesizer (CPS) to generate synthetic point patterns with the concept of the $\alpha$-neighborhood that relaxes the original definition of DP. We present three example models to construct a differentially private PPS and CPS, providing sufficient conditions on their parameters to ensure the DP given a specified privacy budget. In addition, we demonstrate that the synthesizers can be applied to point patterns on the linear network. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed approaches effectively maintain the privacy and utility of synthetic data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Reconstruction of Spatially-Coherent and Realistic Clothed Humans and Objects from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18150v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in human shape learning have focused on achieving accurate human reconstruction from single-view images. However, in the real world, humans share space with other objects. Reconstructing images with humans and objects is challenging due to the occlusions and lack of 3D spatial awareness, which leads to depth ambiguity in the reconstruction. Existing methods in monocular human-object reconstruction fail to capture intricate details of clothed human bodies and object surfaces due to their template-based nature. In this paper, we jointly reconstruct clothed humans and objects in a spatially coherent manner from single-view images, while addressing human-object occlusions. A novel attention-based neural implicit model is proposed that leverages image pixel alignment to retrieve high-quality details, and incorporates semantic features extracted from the human-object pose to enable 3D spatial awareness. A generative diffusion model is used to handle human-object occlusions. For training and evaluation, we introduce a synthetic dataset with rendered scenes of inter-occluded 3D human scans and diverse objects. Extensive evaluation on both synthetic and real datasets demonstrates the superior quality of proposed human-object reconstructions over competitive methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite the success of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) in computer vision, its application to HTR has been rather scattered, leaving key SSL methodologies unexplored. This work focuses on one of them, namely Spatial Context-based SSL. We investigate how this family of approaches can be adapted and optimized for HTR and propose new workflows that leverage the unique features of handwritten text. Our experiments demonstrate that the methods considered lead to advancements in the state-of-the-art of SSL for HTR in a number of benchmark cases.</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we introduce a novel two-stage training framework designed to equip standard LLMs with visual reasoning abilities for maze navigation. First, we leverage Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) on a curated dataset of tokenized maze representations to teach the model to predict step-by-step movement commands. Next, we apply Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-a technique used in DeepSeekR1-with a carefully crafted reward function to refine the model's sequential decision-making and encourage emergent chain-of-thought behaviors. Experimental results on synthetically generated mazes show that while a baseline model fails to navigate the maze, the SFT-trained model achieves 86% accuracy, and further GRPO fine-tuning boosts accuracy to 93%. Qualitative analyses reveal that GRPO fosters more robust and self-corrective reasoning, highlighting the potential of our approach to bridge the gap between language models and visual spatial tasks. These findings offer promising implications for applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and other domains that require integrated visual and sequential reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this scheme, the adaptive spatial modulation (ASM)-based antennas selection works at the receiver by employing the characteristics of the RIS in each time slot, where the signal-to-noise ratio at specific selected antennas can be further enhanced with near few powers. Besides for the bits from constellation symbols, the extra bits can be mapped into the indices of receive antenna combinations and conveyed to the receiver through the ASM-based antenna-combination selection, thus providing higher spectral efficiency. To explicitly present the RASM scheme, the analytical performance of bit error rate of it is discussed in this paper. As a trade-off selection, the proposed scheme shows higher spectral efficiency and remains the satisfactory error performance. Simulation and analytical results demonstrate the better performance and exhibit more potential to apply in practical wireless communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted by IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference (WCNC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[FoREST: Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17775v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human intelligence. One key concept in spatial cognition is the Frame of Reference (FoR), which identifies the perspective of spatial expressions. Despite its significance, FoR has received limited attention in AI models that need spatial intelligence. There is a lack of dedicated benchmarks and in-depth evaluation of large language models (LLMs) in this area. To address this issue, we introduce the Frame of Reference Evaluation in Spatial Reasoning Tasks (FoREST) benchmark, designed to assess FoR comprehension in LLMs. We evaluate LLMs on answering questions that require FoR comprehension and layout generation in text-to-image models using FoREST. Our results reveal a notable performance gap across different FoR classes in various LLMs, affecting their ability to generate accurate layouts for text-to-image generation. This highlights critical shortcomings in FoR comprehension. To improve FoR understanding, we propose Spatial-Guided prompting, which improves LLMs ability to extract essential spatial concepts. Our proposed method improves overall performance across spatial reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[AI-driven 3D Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17761v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A comprehensive three-dimensional (3D) map of tissue architecture and gene expression is crucial for illuminating the complexity and heterogeneity of tissues across diverse biomedical applications. However, most spatial transcriptomics (ST) approaches remain limited to two-dimensional (2D) sections of tissue. Although current 3D ST methods hold promise, they typically require extensive tissue sectioning, are complex, are not compatible with non-destructive 3D tissue imaging technologies, and often lack scalability. Here, we present VOlumetrically Resolved Transcriptomics EXpression (VORTEX), an AI framework that leverages 3D tissue morphology and minimal 2D ST to predict volumetric 3D ST. By pretraining on diverse 3D morphology-transcriptomic pairs from heterogeneous tissue samples and then fine-tuning on minimal 2D ST data from a specific volume of interest, VORTEX learns both generic tissue-related and sample-specific morphological correlates of gene expression. This approach enables dense, high-throughput, and fast 3D ST, scaling seamlessly to large tissue volumes far beyond the reach of existing 3D ST techniques. By offering a cost-effective and minimally destructive route to obtaining volumetric molecular insights, we anticipate that VORTEX will accelerate biomarker discovery and our understanding of morphomolecular associations and cell states in complex tissues. Interactive 3D ST volumes can be viewed at https://vortex-demo.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Through Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling waves of neural activity are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous "Can one hear the shape of a drum?" problem -- which highlights how normal modes of wave dynamics encode geometric information -- we investigate whether similar principles can be leveraged in artificial neural networks. Specifically, we introduce convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli, enabling spatial integration. By then treating these wave-like activation sequences as visual representations themselves, we obtain a powerful representational space that outperforms local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, significantly outperforming local feed-forward models and rivaling non-local U-Net models with fewer parameters. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based communication and visual representation in artificial networks, our findings suggest wave-dynamics may provide efficiency and training stability benefits, while simultaneously offering a new framework for connecting models to biological recordings of neural activity.</p></details> |  |

Existing autoregressive methods, which rely on previous frame-sentence pairs, struggle with high memory usage, slow generation speeds, and limited context integration. To address these issues, we propose ContextualStory, a novel framework designed to generate coherent story frames and extend frames for visual storytelling. ContextualStory utilizes Spatially-Enhanced Temporal Attention to capture spatial and temporal dependencies, handling significant character movements effectively. Additionally, we introduce a Storyline Contextualizer to enrich context in storyline embedding, and a StoryFlow Adapter to measure scene changes between frames for guiding the model. Extensive experiments on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets demonstrate that ContextualStory significantly outperforms existing SOTA methods in both story visualization and continuation.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable translation performance in gloss-free methods by harnessing their powerful natural language generation capabilities. However, these methods often rely on domain-specific fine-tuning of visual encoders to achieve optimal results. By contrast, this paper emphasizes the importance of capturing the spatial configurations and motion dynamics inherent in sign language. With this in mind, we introduce Spatial and Motion-based Sign Language Translation (SpaMo), a novel LLM-based SLT framework. The core idea of SpaMo is simple yet effective. We first extract spatial and motion features using off-the-shelf visual encoders and then input these features into an LLM with a language prompt. Additionally, we employ a visual-text alignment process as a warm-up before the SLT supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that SpaMo achieves state-of-the-art performance on two popular datasets, PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main</p></details> |
| **[Weighted model calibration with spatial conditional information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16785v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cost functions such as mean square error are often used in environmental model calibration. These treat observations as independent and equally important even though model residuals exhibit spatial dependence and additional observations near existing points do not provide as much information on the system as those elsewhere. To address this issue, we develop a method to derive calibration weights based on spatial conditional information. Using simulation experiments with Gaussian processes and the Tephra2 volcanic tephra dispersion model, we show that the additional accuracy and precision from weighted inference increases with the degree of observation clustering and spatial dependence present. To demonstrate real-world relevance, the methods are applied to tephra load observations from the 2014 eruption of the Kelud volcano in Indonesia.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark and Investigation on Spatial-temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03249v3)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across a wide spectrum of tasks; however, they still face limitations in scenarios that demand long-term planning and spatial reasoning. To facilitate this line of research, in this work, we propose a new benchmark, termed $\textbf{P}$ath $\textbf{P}$lanning from $\textbf{N}$atural $\textbf{L}$anguage ($\textbf{PPNL}$). Our benchmark evaluates LLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning by formulating ''path planning'' tasks that require an LLM to navigate to target locations while avoiding obstacles and adhering to constraints. Leveraging this benchmark, we systematically investigate LLMs including GPT-4 via different few-shot prompting methodologies as well as BART and T5 of various sizes via fine-tuning. Our experimental results show the promise of few-shot GPT-4 in spatial reasoning, when it is prompted to reason and act interleavedly, although it still fails to perform long-term temporal reasoning. In contrast, while fine-tuned LLMs achieved impressive results on in-distribution reasoning tasks, they struggled to generalize to larger environments or environments with more obstacles.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce SmartSpatial, an innovative approach that not only enhances the spatial arrangement capabilities of Stable Diffusion but also fosters AI-assisted creative workflows through 3D-aware conditioning and attention-guided mechanisms. SmartSpatial incorporates depth information injection and cross-attention control to ensure precise object placement, delivering notable improvements in spatial accuracy metrics. In conjunction with SmartSpatial, we present SmartSpatialEval, a comprehensive evaluation framework that bridges computational spatial accuracy with qualitative artistic assessments. Experimental results show that SmartSpatial significantly outperforms existing methods, setting new benchmarks for spatial fidelity in AI-driven art and creativity.</p></details> | 9 pages |

In this work, we investigate the influence of different text-based spatial representations on LLM performance and internal activations in a grid-world navigation task. By evaluating models of various sizes on a task that requires navigating toward a goal, we examine how the format used to encode spatial information impacts decision-making. Our experiments reveal that cartesian representations of space consistently yield higher success rates and path efficiency, with performance scaling markedly with model size. Moreover, probing LLaMA-3.1-8B revealed subsets of internal units, primarily located in intermediate layers, that robustly correlate with spatial features, such as the position of the agent in the grid or action correctness, regardless of how that information is represented, and are also activated by unrelated spatial reasoning tasks. This work advances our understanding of how LLMs process spatial information and provides valuable insights for developing more interpretable and robust agentic AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Common destinations, typically referred to as hubs or points of interest, are arguably the most effective spots for the type of disease spread via airborne transmission. In this work, we model the locations of individuals (agents) and common destinations (hubs) by random spatial point processes in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and focus on disease propagation through agents visiting common hubs. The probability of an agent visiting a hub depends on their distance through a connection function $f$. The system is represented by a random bipartite geometric (RBG) graph. We study the degrees and percolation of the RBG graph for general connection functions. We show that the critical density of hubs for percolation is dictated by the support of the connection function $f$, which reveals the critical role of long-distance travel (or its restrictions) in disease spreading.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Network Science and Engineering</p></details> |

The framework combines a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) inferring the two spatially varying TGV parameters with an unrolled algorithmic scheme that solves the corresponding variational problem. The two subnetworks are jointly trained end-to-end in a supervised fashion and as such the CNN learns to compute those parameters that drive the reconstructed images as close to the ground truth as possible. Numerical results in image denoising and MRI reconstruction show a significant qualitative and quantitative improvement compared to the best TGV scalar parameter case as well as to other approaches employing spatially varying parameters computed by unsupervised methods. We also observe that the inferred spatially varying parameter maps have a consistent structure near the image edges, asking for further theoretical investigations. In particular, the parameter that weighs the first-order TGV term has a triple-edge structure with alternating high-low-high values whereas the one that weighs the second-order term attains small values in a large neighbourhood around the edges.</p></details> |  |

In order to simultaneously visualize more objects, in this paper, we propose to use video-to-video translation that mimics the development process of microscopic objects. In essence, we use a microscopy video-to-video translation framework namely Spatial-temporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) to reveal the spatial and temporal relationships between the microscopic objects, after which a microscopy video of one object can be translated to another object in a different domain. The experimental results confirm that the proposed STGAN is effective in microscopy video-to-video translation that mitigates the spectral conflicts caused by the limited fluorescent labels, allowing multiple microscopic objects be simultaneously visualized.</p></details> |  |

The spatial structure of the data significantly impacts valid statistical inference. Existing models for areal data often rely on adjacency matrices, struggling to differentiate between polygons of varying sizes and shapes. Conversely, data fusion models rely on computationally intensive numerical integrals, presenting challenges for moderately large datasets. In response to these issues, we propose the Hausdorff-Gaussian process (HGP), a versatile model utilizing the Hausdorff distance to capture spatial dependence in both point and areal data. Integration into generalized linear mixed-effects models enhances its applicability, particularly in addressing data fusion challenges. We validate our approach through a comprehensive simulation study and application to two real-world scenarios: one involving areal data and another demonstrating its effectiveness in data fusion. The results suggest that the HGP is competitive with specialized models regarding goodness-of-fit and prediction performances. In summary, the HGP offers a flexible and robust solution for modeling spatial data of various types and shapes, with potential applications spanning fields such as public health and climate science.</p></details> |  |

The proposed estimation methodology covers both homoscedastic and heteroscedastic data, ensuring consistency and efficiency in the estimators of the parameters $\pmb{\rho}$ and $\pmb{\beta}$. The model is based on a robust theoretical framework, supported by the analysis of the asymptotic properties of the estimators, which reinforces its practical implementation. To facilitate its use, an algorithm has been developed in the R software, making it a standard tool for the analysis of complex spatial data. The proposed model proves to be more effective than other similar techniques, especially when modeling data with normal spatial structures and non-normal distributions, even when the residuals are not homoscedastic. Finally, the application of the model to homicide rates in the United States highlights its advantages in both statistical and social analysis, positioning it as a key tool for the analysis of spatial data in various disciplines.</p></details> |  |

We describe toric codes as quantum counterparts of classical two-dimensional spatially-coupled (2D-SC) codes, and introduce spatially-coupled quantum LDPC (SC-QLDPC) codes as a generalization. We use the convolutional structure to represent the parity check matrix of a 2D-SC code as a polynomial in two indeterminates, and derive an algebraic condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a 2D-SC code to be a stabilizer code. This algebraic framework facilitates the construction of new code families. While not the focus of this paper, we note that small memory facilitates physical connectivity of qubits, and it enables local encoding and low-latency windowed decoding. In this paper, we use the algebraic framework to optimize short cycles in the Tanner graph of 2D-SC hypergraph product (HGP) codes that arise from short cycles in either component code. While prior work focuses on QLDPC codes with rate less than 1/10, we construct 2D-SC HGP codes with small memories, higher rates (about 1/3), and superior thresholds.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 10 figures.

However, while latent space modeling paradigms have transformed image and video generation, similar approaches are more difficult for most dynamical systems. Such systems -- from chemical molecule structures to collective human behavior -- are described by interactions of entities, making them inherently linked to connectivity patterns and the traceability of entities over time. Our approach, LaM-SLidE (Latent Space Modeling of Spatial Dynamical Systems via Linked Entities), combines the advantages of graph neural networks, i.e., the traceability of entities across time-steps, with the efficiency and scalability of recent advances in image and video generation, where pre-trained encoder and decoder are frozen to enable generative modeling in the latent space. The core idea of LaM-SLidE is to introduce identifier representations (IDs) to allow for retrieval of entity properties, e.g., entity coordinates, from latent system representations and thus enables traceability. Experimentally, across different domains, we show that LaM-SLidE performs favorably in terms of speed, accuracy, and generalizability.

Egocentric spatial images and videos are emerging as a compelling form of stereoscopic XR content. The assessment for the Quality of Experience (QoE) of XR content is important to ensure a high-quality viewing experience. Different from traditional 2D images, egocentric spatial images present challenges for perceptual quality assessment due to their special shooting, processing methods, and stereoscopic characteristics. However, the corresponding image quality assessment (IQA) research for egocentric spatial images is still lacking. In this paper, we establish the Egocentric Spatial Images Quality Assessment Database (ESIQAD), the first IQA database dedicated for egocentric spatial images as far as we know. Our ESIQAD includes 500 egocentric spatial images and the corresponding mean opinion scores (MOSs) under three display modes, including 2D display, 3D-window display, and 3D-immersive display. Based on our ESIQAD, we propose a novel mamba2-based multi-stage feature fusion model, termed ESIQAnet, which predicts the perceptual quality of egocentric spatial images under the three display modes. Specifically, we first extract features from multiple visual state space duality (VSSD) blocks, then apply cross attention to fuse binocular view information and use transposed attention to further refine the features. The multi-stage features are finally concatenated and fed into a quality regression network to predict the quality score. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ESIQAnet outperforms 22 state-of-the-art IQA models on the ESIQAD under all three display modes. The database and code are available at https://github.com/IntMeGroup/ESIQA.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SAAP, a Spatial Awareness and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SAAP intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE). Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SAAP significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3\% to 40\% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SAAP parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SAAP to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.</p></details> |  |

It is desirable to develop flexible regression models that allow for nonlinearities and interactions in the covariate specification. Existing machine learning approaches that allow for spatial dependence in the residuals fail to provide reliable uncertainty estimates. In this paper, we investigate the combination of a Gaussian process spatial model with a Bayesian Additive Regression Tree (BART) model. The computational burden of the approach is reduced by combining Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) technique. We study the performance of the method first via simulation. We then use the model to predict anthropometric responses in Kenya, with the data collected via a complex sampling design. In particular, household survey data are collected via stratified two-stage unequal probability cluster sampling, which requires special care when modeled.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian spatio-temporal modelling for infectious disease outbreak detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01456v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Bayesian analysis of infectious disease surveillance data from multiple locations typically involves building and fitting a spatio-temporal model of how the disease spreads in the structured population. Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection. Our work represents the first use of the PEMF dataset for binary pain classification and demonstrates the effectiveness of these models through extensive experimentation.

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[H-FLTN: A Privacy-Preserving Hierarchical Framework for Electric Vehicle Spatio-Temporal Charge Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18697v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses critical challenges for energy providers, particularly in predicting charging time (temporal prediction), ensuring user privacy, and managing resources efficiently in mobility-driven networks. This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, our model provides valuable feedback through qualitative illustrations, effectively highlighting the significance of joints in specific exercises.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEAP: Enhancing Vision-Based Occupancy Networks with Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Correlation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15438v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-based occupancy networks provide an end-to-end solution for reconstructing the surrounding environment using semantic occupied voxels derived from multi-view images. This technique relies on effectively learning the correlation between pixel-level visual information and voxels. Despite recent advancements, occupancy results still suffer from limited accuracy due to occlusions and sparse visual cues. To address this, we propose a Lightweight Spatio-Temporal Correlation (LEAP)} method, which significantly enhances the performance of existing occupancy networks with minimal computational overhead. LEAP can be seamlessly integrated into various baseline networks, enabling a plug-and-play application. LEAP operates in three stages: 1) it tokenizes information from recent baseline and motion features into a shared, compact latent space; 2) it establishes full correlation through a tri-stream fusion architecture; 3) it generates occupancy results that strengthen the baseline's output. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, outperforming the latest baseline models. The source code and several demos are available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI |

However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future. AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression. We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis.

Existing spatio-temporal data secure retrieval schemes have significant shortcomings regarding dynamic updates, either compromising privacy through leakage during updates (forward insecurity) or incurring excessively high update costs that hinder practical application. Under these circumstances, we first propose a basic filter-based spatio-temporal range query scheme \TrinityI that supports low-cost dynamic updates and automatic expansion. Furthermore, to improve security, reduce storage cost, and false positives, we propose a forward secure and verifiable scheme \TrinityII that simultaneously minimizes storage overhead. A formal security analysis proves that \TrinityI and \TrinityII are Indistinguishable under Selective Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-SCPA). Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our design \TrinityII significantly reduces storage requirements by 80\%, enables data retrieval at the 1 million-record level in just 0.01 seconds, and achieves 10 $\times$ update efficiency than state-of-art.</p></details> | 14pages,6 figures |

Naturally, automated detection of forged Deepfake videos is attracting a proportional amount of interest of researchers. Current methods for detecting forged videos mainly rely on global frame features and under-utilize the spatio-temporal inconsistencies found in the manipulated videos. Moreover, they fail to attend to manipulation-specific subtle and well-localized pattern variations along both spatial and temporal dimensions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a neural Deepfake detector that focuses on the localized manipulative signatures of the forged videos at individual frame level as well as frame sequence level. Using a ResNet backbone, it strengthens the shallow frame-level feature learning with a spatial attention mechanism. The spatial stream of the model is further helped by fusing texture enhanced shallow features with the deeper features. Simultaneously, the model processes frame sequences with a distance attention mechanism that further allows fusion of temporal attention maps with the learned features at the deeper layers. The overall model is trained to detect forged content as a classifier. We evaluate our method on two popular large data sets and achieve significant performance over the state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, our technique also provides memory and computational advantages over the competitive techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Effective Dynamics across Spatio-Temporal Scales of Complex Flows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07990v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling and simulation of complex fluid flows with dynamics that span multiple spatio-temporal scales is a fundamental challenge in many scientific and engineering domains. Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)</p></details> |

In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress. Finally, we explore potential opportunities and directions to advance research towards the aim of effective and broadly applicable STFMs.</p></details> |  |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

This task is however challenging due to multiple sign variations, complexity in language and inherent richness of expressions. Computational approaches have evidenced capabilities to support SLT. Nonetheless, these approaches remain limited to cover gestures variability and support long sequence translations. This paper introduces a Transformer-based architecture that encodes spatio-temporal motion gestures, preserving both local and long-range spatial information through the use of multiple convolutional and attention mechanisms. The proposed approach was validated on the Colombian Sign Language Translation Dataset (CoL-SLTD) outperforming baseline approaches, and achieving a BLEU4 of 46.84%. Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T), achieving a BLEU4 score of 30.77%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world variations</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Automated Extraction of Spatio-Semantic Graphs for Identifying Cognitive Impairment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01685v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Spatio-Temporal Architecture for Dynamic Effective Connectivity Network Analysis Based on Dynamic Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18859v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic effective connectivity networks (dECNs) reveal the changing directed brain activity and the dynamic causal influences among brain regions, which facilitate the identification of individual differences and enhance the understanding of human brain. Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Species Distribution Models (SDMs) often suffer from spatial autocorrelation (SAC), leading to biased performance estimates. We tested cross-validation (CV) strategies - random splits, spatial blocking with varied distances, environmental (ENV) clustering, and a novel spatio-temporal method - under two proposed training schemes: LAST FOLD, widely used in spatial CV at the cost of data loss, and RETRAIN, which maximizes data usage but risks reintroducing SAC. LAST FOLD consistently yielded lower errors and stronger correlations. Spatial blocking at an optimal distance (SP 422) and ENV performed best, achieving Spearman and Pearson correlations of 0.485 and 0.548, respectively, although ENV may be unsuitable for long-term forecasts involving major environmental shifts. A spatio-temporal approach yielded modest benefits in our moderately variable dataset, but may excel with stronger temporal changes. These findings highlight the need to align CV approaches with the spatial and temporal structure of SDM data, ensuring rigorous validation and reliable predictive outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Self-adaptive Anchor Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08653v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event prediction tasks often handle spatio-temporal data distributed in a large spatial area. Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction.

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. Our codes and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Anakin2555/DecomposeWHAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |

Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Get Rid of Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Since then LSTM temporal blocks have been proposed and shown to have promising results.

We provide theoretical arguments for the different temporal blocks and use a multitude of tests across different datasets to assess our hypotheses.</p></details> |  |

ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> | 11 |

However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Small perturbations in conditions can often lead to significant changes in fire spread (such as speed and direction), necessitating a computationally expensive large set of simulations to quantify uncertainty. Model emulation seeks alternative representations of physical models using machine learning, aiming to provide more efficient and/or simplified surrogate models. We propose a dedicated spatio-temporal neural network based framework for model emulation, able to capture the complex behaviour of fire spread models. The proposed approach can approximate forecasts at fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are often challenging for neural network based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is robust even with small training sets, due to novel data augmentation methods. Empirical experiments show good agreement between simulated and emulated firefronts, with an average Jaccard score of 0.76.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |

Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

For each pattern, we construct an independent adaptive spatio-temporal fusion graph based on a cross-attention mechanism, employing residual graph convolution modules and time series modules to better capture dynamic spatio-temporal relationships under different fine-grained traffic patterns.

However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research.

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | TKDE (Under Review) |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

In light of this, we propose a deep spatio-temporal hypergraph convolutional neural network for soft sensing (ST-HCSS). In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes. Our results validate the superiority of ST-HCSS compared to existing state-of-the-art soft sensors, and demonstrates that the learned hypergraph feature representations aligns well with the sensor data correlations.

This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., "amodal") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://jiawei-yang.github.io/STORM/</p></details> |
| **[STARFormer: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Reorganization Transformer of FMRI for Brain Disorder Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00378v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many existing methods that use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) classify brain disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), often overlook the integration of spatial and temporal dependencies of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, which may lead to inaccurate or imprecise classification results. To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Multi-Subgraph GCN for 3D Human Motion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00317v1)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion prediction (HMP) involves forecasting future human motion based on historical data. Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered widespread attention in this field for their proficiency in capturing relationships among joints in human motion. However, existing GCN-based methods tend to focus on either temporal-domain or spatial-domain features, or they combine spatio-temporal features without fully leveraging the complementarity and cross-dependency of these two features. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Multi-Subgraph Graph Convolutional Network (STMS-GCN) to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer at multiple scales through a spatio-temporal information consistency constraint mechanism. Besides, we utilize multiple subgraphs to extract richer motion information and enhance the learning associations of diverse subgraphs through a homogeneous information constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the standard HMP benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Electromagnetic Kernel Learning for Channel Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17414v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate channel prediction is essential for addressing channel aging caused by user mobility. However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an EIT-inspired Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel predictor with improved performance.

Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and paves the way for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to the twin threats of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal in nature. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Global Spatio-Temporal Fusion-based Traffic Prediction Algorithm with Anomaly Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14569v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is an indispensable component of urban planning and traffic management. Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years.

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.

An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research. Recently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant sensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras producing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated samples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh samples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility of distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent representation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily linked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider physical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI for different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product kernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI, while for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and vary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different spatial topologies and sensor densities.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the development of TextVQA in image domain, existing Video TextVQA approaches leverage a language model (e.g. T5) to process text-rich multiple frames and generate answers auto-regressively. Nevertheless, the spatio-temporal relationships among visual entities (including scene text and objects) will be disrupted and models are susceptible to interference from unrelated information, resulting in irrational reasoning and inaccurate answering. To tackle these challenges, we propose the TEA (stands for ``\textbf{T}rack th\textbf{E} \textbf{A}nswer'') method that better extends the generative TextVQA framework from image to video. TEA recovers the spatio-temporal relationships in a complementary way and incorporates OCR-aware clues to enhance the quality of reasoning questions. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. TEA outperforms existing TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods and video large language models by great margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

So is statistics, the queen of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics, thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity. Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard. Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.</p></details> | An updated version |

However, the complex and dynamic nature of these correlations presents significant modeling challenges. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal dynamic hypergraph learning (STDHL) model. This model uses a hypergraph structure to represent spatial features among wind farms. Unlike traditional graph structures, which only capture pair-wise node features, hypergraphs create hyperedges connecting multiple nodes, enabling the representation and transmission of higher-order spatial features. The STDHL model incorporates a novel dynamic hypergraph convolutional layer to model dynamic spatial correlations and a grouped temporal convolutional layer for channel-independent temporal modeling. The model uses spatio-temporal encoders to extract features from multi-source covariates, which are mapped to quantile results through a forecast decoder. Experimental results using the GEFCom dataset show that the STDHL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis highlights the critical role of spatio-temporal covariates in improving ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs.

| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

| **[Anytime-Constrained Equilibria in Polynomial Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23637v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend anytime constraints to the Markov game setting and the corresponding solution concept of an anytime-constrained equilibrium (ACE). Then, we present a comprehensive theory of anytime-constrained equilibria that includes (1) a computational characterization of feasible policies, (2) a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for computing ACE, and (3) a polynomial-time algorithm for approximately computing ACE. Since computing a feasible policy is NP-hard even for two-player zero-sum games, our approximation guarantees are optimal so long as $P \neq NP$. We also develop the first theory of efficient computation for action-constrained Markov games, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |

Its ability to amplify and resonate with the pilot's psyche enables real-time mental control, creating unique applications such as psychomagnetic fields and sensory-based weaponry. This paper presents the development of a novel robotic control system inspired by the Psycho Frame, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and deep learning for real-time control of robotic systems. By capturing and interpreting brainwave data through EEG, the system extends human cognitive commands to robotic actions, reflecting the seamless synchronization of thought and machine, much like the Psyco Frame's integration with a Newtype pilot's mental faculties. This research demonstrates how modern AI techniques can expand the limits of human-machine interaction, potentially transcending traditional input methods and enabling a deeper, more intuitive control of complex robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

Current zero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with their performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the pre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting diverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel framework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs) sequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal characteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable PTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and fuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of these PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks, allowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation space of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that SeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closed-loop model-predictive wind farm flow control under time-varying inflow using FLORIDyn](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02790v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wind farm flow control has been a key research focus in recent years, driven by the idea that a collectively operating wind farm can outperform individually controlled turbines. Control strategies are predominantly applied in an open-loop manner, where the current flow conditions are used to look up precomputed steady-state set points. Closed-loop control approaches, on the other hand, take measurements from the farm into account and optimize their set points online, which makes them more flexible and resilient. This paper introduces a closed-loop model-predictive wind farm controller using the dynamic engineering model FLORIDyn to maximize the energy generated by a ten-turbine wind farm. The framework consists of an Ensemble Kalman Filter to continuously correct the flow field estimate, as well as a novel optimization strategy. To this end the paper discusses two dynamic ways to maximize the farm energy and compares this to the current look-up table industry standard. The framework relies solely on turbine measurements without using a flow field preview. In a 3-hour case study with time-varying conditions, the derived controllers achieve an overall energy gain of 3 to 4.4 % with noise-free wind direction measurements. If disturbed and biased measurements are used, this performance decreases to 1.9 to 3 % over the greedy control baseline with the same measurements. The comparison to look-up table controllers shows that the closed-loop framework performance is more robust to disturbed measurements but can only match the performance in noise-free conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance of Zero-Shot Time Series Foundation Models on Cloud Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12944v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a popular paradigm for zero-shot multi-domain forecasting. FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically, showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread failure of FMs to model cloud data.</p></details> | 5 pages, Preprint |
| **[Weight transport through spike timing for robust local gradients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02642v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In both machine learning and in computational neuroscience, plasticity in functional neural networks is frequently expressed as gradient descent on a cost. Often, this imposes symmetry constraints that are difficult to reconcile with local computation, as is required for biological networks or neuromorphic hardware. For example, wake-sleep learning in networks characterized by Boltzmann distributions builds on the assumption of symmetric connectivity. Similarly, the error backpropagation algorithm is notoriously plagued by the weight transport problem between the representation and the error stream. Existing solutions such as feedback alignment tend to circumvent the problem by deferring to the robustness of these algorithms to weight asymmetry. However, they are known to scale poorly with network size and depth. We introduce spike-based alignment learning (SAL), a complementary learning rule for spiking neural networks, which uses spike timing statistics to extract and correct the asymmetry between effective reciprocal connections. Apart from being spike-based and fully local, our proposed mechanism takes advantage of noise. Based on an interplay between Hebbian and anti-Hebbian plasticity, synapses can thereby recover the true local gradient. This also alleviates discrepancies that arise from neuron and synapse variability -- an omnipresent property of physical neuronal networks. We demonstrate the efficacy of our mechanism using different spiking network models. First, we show how SAL can significantly improve convergence to the target distribution in probabilistic spiking networks as compared to Hebbian plasticity alone. Second, in neuronal hierarchies based on cortical microcircuits, we show how our proposed mechanism effectively enables the alignment of feedback weights to the forward pathway, thus allowing the backpropagation of correct feedback errors.</p></details> | 19 pages, 9 figures |
| **[PAD: Personalized Alignment of LLMs at Decoding-Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04070v6)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning with personalized preferences, which vary significantly across cultural, educational, and political differences, poses a significant challenge due to the computational costs and data demands of traditional alignment methods. In response, this paper presents Personalized Alignment at Decoding-time (PAD), a novel framework designed to align LLM outputs with diverse personalized preferences during the inference phase, eliminating the need for additional training. By introducing a unique personalized reward modeling strategy, this framework decouples the text generation process from personalized preferences, facilitating the generation of generalizable token-level personalized rewards. The PAD algorithm leverages these rewards to guide the decoding process, dynamically tailoring the base model's predictions to personalized preferences. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that PAD not only outperforms existing training-based alignment methods in terms of aligning with diverse preferences but also shows significant generalizability to preferences unseen during training and scalability across different base models. This work advances the capability of LLMs to meet user needs in real-time applications, presenting a substantial step forward in personalized LLM alignment.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Training a multilayer dynamical spintronic network with standard machine learning tools to perform time series classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02835v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to process time-series at low energy cost is critical for many applications. Recurrent neural network, which can perform such tasks, are computationally expensive when implementing in software on conventional computers. Here we propose to implement a recurrent neural network in hardware using spintronic oscillators as dynamical neurons. Using numerical simulations, we build a multi-layer network and demonstrate that we can use backpropagation through time (BPTT) and standard machine learning tools to train this network. Leveraging the transient dynamics of the spintronic oscillators, we solve the sequential digits classification task with $89.83\pm2.91~\%$ accuracy, as good as the equivalent software network. We devise guidelines on how to choose the time constant of the oscillators as well as hyper-parameters of the network to adapt to different input time scales.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[FNETS: Factor-adjusted network estimation and forecasting for high-dimensional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06110v6)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FNETS, a methodology for network estimation and forecasting of high-dimensional time series exhibiting strong serial- and cross-sectional correlations. We operate under a factor-adjusted vector autoregressive (VAR) model which, after accounting for pervasive co-movements of the variables by {\it common} factors, models the remaining {\it idiosyncratic} dynamic dependence between the variables as a sparse VAR process. Network estimation of FNETS consists of three steps: (i) factor-adjustment via dynamic principal component analysis, (ii) estimation of the latent VAR process via $\ell_1$-regularised Yule-Walker estimator, and (iii) estimation of partial correlation and long-run partial correlation matrices. In doing so, we learn three networks underpinning the VAR process, namely a directed network representing the Granger causal linkages between the variables, an undirected one embedding their contemporaneous relationships and finally, an undirected network that summarises both lead-lag and contemporaneous linkages. In addition, FNETS provides a suite of methods for forecasting the factor-driven and the idiosyncratic VAR processes. Under general conditions permitting tails heavier than the Gaussian one, we derive uniform consistency rates for the estimators in both network estimation and forecasting, which hold as the dimension of the panel and the sample size diverge. Simulation studies and real data application confirm the good performance of FNETS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smoothing the Shift: Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation under Complex Multimodal Noises](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02616v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) aims to tackle distribution shifts using unlabeled test data without access to the source data. In the context of multimodal data, there are more complex noise patterns than unimodal data such as simultaneous corruptions for multiple modalities and missing modalities. Besides, in real-world applications, corruptions from different distribution shifts are always mixed. Existing TTA methods always fail in such multimodal scenario because the abrupt distribution shifts will destroy the prior knowledge from the source model, thus leading to performance degradation. To this end, we reveal a new challenge named multimodal wild TTA. To address this challenging problem, we propose two novel strategies: sample identification with interquartile range Smoothing and unimodal assistance, and Mutual information sharing (SuMi). SuMi smooths the adaptation process by interquartile range which avoids the abrupt distribution shifts. Then, SuMi fully utilizes the unimodal features to select low-entropy samples with rich multimodal information for optimization. Furthermore, mutual information sharing is introduced to align the information, reduce the discrepancies and enhance the information utilization across different modalities. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show the effectiveness and superiority over existing methods under the complex noise patterns in multimodal data. Code is available at https://github.com/zrguo/SuMi.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Channel-wise Dynamic Fusion Model: Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting via Entropy Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02609v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity is an intrinsic property of real-world time series and plays a crucial role in time series forecasting. Previous studies primarily adopt instance normalization to attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for better predictability. However, instance normalization that directly removes the inherent non-stationarity can lead to three issues: (1) disrupting global temporal dependencies, (2) ignoring channel-specific differences, and (3) producing over-smoothed predictions. To address these issues, we theoretically demonstrate that variance can be a valid and interpretable proxy for quantifying non-stationarity of time series. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel lightweight \textit{C}hannel-wise \textit{D}ynamic \textit{F}usion \textit{M}odel (\textit{CDFM}), which selectively and dynamically recovers intrinsic non-stationarity of the original series, while keeping the predictability of normalized series. First, we design a Dual-Predictor Module, which involves two branches: a Time Stationary Predictor for capturing stable patterns and a Time Non-stationary Predictor for modeling global dynamics patterns. Second, we propose a Fusion Weight Learner to dynamically characterize the intrinsic non-stationary information across different samples based on variance. Finally, we introduce a Channel Selector to selectively recover non-stationary information from specific channels by evaluating their non-stationarity, similarity, and distribution consistency, enabling the model to capture relevant dynamic features and avoid overfitting. Comprehensive experiments on seven time series datasets demonstrate the superiority and generalization capabilities of CDFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixing Time Matters: Accelerating Effective Resistance Estimation via Bidirectional Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02513v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of efficiently approximating the \textit{effective resistance} (ER) on undirected graphs, where ER is a widely used node proximity measure with applications in graph spectral sparsification, multi-class graph clustering, network robustness analysis, graph machine learning, and more. Specifically, given any nodes $s$ and $t$ in an undirected graph $G$, we aim to efficiently estimate the ER value $R(s,t)$ between nodes $s$ and $t$, ensuring a small absolute error $\epsilon$. The previous best algorithm for this problem has a worst-case computational complexity of $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{L_{\max}^3}{\epsilon^2 d^2}\right)$, where the value of $L_{\max}$ depends on the mixing time of random walks on $G$, $d = \min\{d(s), d(t)\}$, and $d(s)$, $d(t)$ denote the degrees of nodes $s$ and $t$, respectively. We improve this complexity to $\tilde{O}\left(\min\left\{\frac{L_{\max}^{7/3}}{\epsilon^{2/3}}, \frac{L_{\max}^3}{\epsilon^2d^2}, mL_{\max}\right\}\right)$, achieving a theoretical improvement of $\tilde{O}\left(\max\left\{\frac{L_{\max}^{2/3}}{\epsilon^{4/3} d^2}, 1, \frac{L_{\max}^2}{\epsilon^2 d^2 m}\right\}\right)$ over previous results. Here, $m$ denotes the number of edges. Given that $L_{\max}$ is often very large in real-world networks (e.g., $L_{\max} > 10^4$), our improvement on $L_{\max}$ is significant, especially for real-world networks. We also conduct extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic graph datasets to empirically demonstrate the superiority of our method. The experimental results show that our method achieves a $10\times$ to $1000\times$ speedup in running time while maintaining the same absolute error compared to baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

| **[BRIDGE: Bootstrapping Text to Control Time-Series Generation via Multi-Agent Iterative Optimization and Diffusion Modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02445v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series Generation (TSG) is a prominent research area with broad applications in simulations, data augmentation, and counterfactual analysis. While existing methods have shown promise in unconditional single-domain TSG, real-world applications demand for cross-domain approaches capable of controlled generation tailored to domain-specific constraints and instance-level requirements. In this paper, we argue that text can provide semantic insights, domain information and instance-specific temporal patterns, to guide and improve TSG. We introduce ``Text-Controlled TSG'', a task focused on generating realistic time series by incorporating textual descriptions. To address data scarcity in this setting, we propose a novel LLM-based Multi-Agent framework that synthesizes diverse, realistic text-to-TS datasets. Furthermore, we introduce BRIDGE, a hybrid text-controlled TSG framework that integrates semantic prototypes with text description for supporting domain-level guidance. This approach achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity on 11 of 12 datasets, and improves controllability by 12.52% on MSE and 6.34% MAE compared to no text input generation, highlighting its potential for generating tailored time-series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Trace of the Times: Rootkit Detection through Temporal Anomalies in Kernel Activity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02402v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kernel rootkits provide adversaries with permanent high-privileged access to compromised systems and are often a key element of sophisticated attack chains. At the same time, they enable stealthy operation and are thus difficult to detect. Thereby, they inject code into kernel functions to appear invisible to users, for example, by manipulating file enumerations. Existing detection approaches are insufficient, because they rely on signatures that are unable to detect novel rootkits or require domain knowledge about the rootkits to be detected. To overcome this challenge, our approach leverages the fact that runtimes of kernel functions targeted by rootkits increase when additional code is executed. The framework outlined in this paper injects probes into the kernel to measure time stamps of functions within relevant system calls, computes distributions of function execution times, and uses statistical tests to detect time shifts. The evaluation of our open-source implementation on publicly available data sets indicates high detection accuracy with an F1 score of 98.7\% across five scenarios with varying system states.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, we provide a new $\ell_{1,\infty}$ identity with mathematical proof and experimental validation. Experiments show that our bi-level $\ell_{1,\infty}$ projection is $2.5$ times faster than the actual fastest algorithm and provides the best sparsity while keeping the same accuracy in classification applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2405.02086</p></details> |

To address the high computational costs of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, this paper introduces TwinLiteNetPlus (TwinLiteNet$^+$), a model adept at balancing efficiency and accuracy. TwinLiteNet$^+$ incorporates standard and depth-wise separable dilated convolutions, reducing complexity while maintaining high accuracy. It is available in four configurations, from the robust 1.94 million-parameter TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Large}}$ to the ultra-compact 34K-parameter TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Nano}}$. Notably, TwinLiteNet$^+_{\text{Large}}$ attains a 92.9\% mIoU for Drivable Area Segmentation and a 34.2\% IoU for Lane Segmentation. These results notably outperform those of current SOTA models while requiring a computational cost that is approximately 11 times lower in terms of Floating Point Operations (FLOPs) compared to the existing SOTA model. Extensively tested on various embedded devices, TwinLiteNet$^+$ demonstrates promising latency and power efficiency, underscoring its suitability for real-world autonomous vehicle applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on sequential change-point detection on high-order compositional time series models. Under the regularity conditions, we prove that a process following the generalized Beta AR(p) model with exogenous variables is stationary and ergodic. We develop a nonparametric sequential change-point detection method for the generalized Beta AR(p) model, which does not rely on any strong assumptions about the sources of the change points. We show that the power of the test converges to one given that the amount of initial observations is large enough. We apply the nonparametric method to a rate of automobile crashes with alcohol involved, which is recorded monthly from January 2010 to December 2020; the exogenous variable is the price level of alcoholic beverages, which has a change point around August 2019. We fit a generalized Beta AR(p) model to the crash rate sequence, and we use the nonparametric sequential change-point detection method to successfully detect the change point.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches either require time-consuming offline processing with a complete map, or rely on expensive sensors and substantial computational resources. To address the problems, we propose Floorplan-SLAM, which incorporates floorplan reconstruction tightly into a multi-session SLAM system by seamlessly interacting with plane extraction, pose estimation, and back-end optimization, achieving real-time, high-accuracy, and long-term floorplan reconstruction using only a stereo camera. Specifically, we present a robust plane extraction algorithm that operates in a compact plane parameter space and leverages spatially complementary features to accurately detect planar structures, even in weakly textured scenes. Furthermore, we propose a floorplan reconstruction module tightly coupled with the SLAM system, which uses continuously optimized plane landmarks and poses to formulate and solve a novel optimization problem, thereby enabling real-time incremental floorplan reconstruction. Note that by leveraging the map merging capability of multi-session SLAM, our method supports long-term floorplan reconstruction across multiple sessions without redundant data collection. Experiments on the VECtor and the self-collected datasets indicate that Floorplan-SLAM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of plane extraction robustness, pose estimation accuracy, and floorplan reconstruction fidelity and speed, achieving real-time performance at 25-45 FPS without GPU acceleration, which reduces the floorplan reconstruction time for a 1000 square meters scene from over 10 hours to just 9.44 minutes.</p></details> |  |

This enabled the discovery of a new extragalactic fast X-ray transient (FXT) in Chandra archival data, XRT 200515, a needle-in-the-haystack event and the first Chandra FXT of its kind. Recent serendipitous discoveries in X-ray astronomy, including FXTs from binary neutron star mergers and an extragalactic planetary transit candidate, highlight the need for systematic transient searches in X-ray archives. We introduce new event file representations, E-t maps and E-t-dt cubes, that effectively encode both temporal and spectral information, enabling the seamless application of machine learning to variable-length event file time series. Our unsupervised learning approach employs PCA or sparse autoencoders to extract low-dimensional, informative features from these data representations, followed by clustering in the embedding space with DBSCAN. New transients are identified within transient-dominant clusters or through nearest-neighbour searches around known transients, producing a catalogue of 3559 candidates (3447 flares and 112 dips). XRT 200515 exhibits unique temporal and spectral variability, including an intense, hard <10s initial burst, followed by spectral softening in an ~800s oscillating tail. We interpret XRT 200515 as either the first giant magnetar flare observed at low X-ray energies or the first extragalactic Type I X-ray burst from a faint, previously unknown low-mass X-ray binary in the LMC. Our method extends to data sets from other observatories such as XMM-Newton, Swift-XRT, eROSITA, Einstein Probe, and upcoming missions like AXIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, accepted in Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society</p></details> |

One of the main challenges for the 50G PON is implementing burst-mode digital signal processing (BM-DSP) for the burst upstream signal. In this paper, we demonstrate a real-time BM-DSP for burst reception of 25Gbit/s on-off keying signal to meet the asymmetric-mode 50G PON demand. The real-time BM-DSP includes the BM frequency-domain timing recovery and BM frequency-domain equalizer, which can be fast converged based on the 42ns designed preamble. Meanwhile, the simplified implementations for fast-Fourier-transform, minimum-mean-square-error, and decision-directed least-mean-square-error algorithms decrease the DSP resources by 28.57%, enabling the loading of real-time BM-DSP in the field programmable gate array with the limited DSP resources. The real-time implementation of BM-DSP can guide the design of application-specific integrated circuits for 50G PON.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to Journal of Optical Communications and Networking</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we present Recipe2Plan, a novel benchmark framework based on real-world cooking scenarios. Unlike conventional benchmarks, Recipe2Plan challenges agents to optimize cooking time through parallel task execution while respecting temporal constraints i.e. specific actions need to be performed within a particular time intervals following the preceding steps. Overly aggressive local parallelization may disrupt this constraint, potentially compromising the entire cooking process. This strict time constraint between actions raises a unique challenge for agents to balance between maximizing concurrent operations and adhering to critical timing constraints. Extensive experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal challenges in maintaining this balance between efficiency and feasibility. The results highlight the need for improved temporal awareness and global multitasking capabilities in large language models. We open-source our benchmark and code at https://github.com/WilliamZR/Recipe2Plan.</p></details> |  |

Although, sophisticated reconstruction and prediction models exist for video anomaly detection, effective handling of non-stationarity has seldom been considered explicitly. In this paper, we propose to perform prediction using a time-recursive differencing network followed by autoregressive moving average estimation for video anomaly detection. The differencing network is employed to effectively handle non-stationarity in video data during the anomaly detection. Focusing on the prediction process, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated considering a simple optical flow based video feature, and by generating qualitative and quantitative results on three aerial video datasets and two standard anomaly detection video datasets. EER, AUC and ROC curve based comparison with several existing methods including the state-of-the-art reveal the superiority of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Copyr...</summary><p>Copyright 2022 IEEE.

| **[Attention Bootstrapping for Multi-Modal Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02221v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation aims to adapt a well-trained model to potential distribution shifts at test time using only unlabeled test data, without access to the original training data. While previous efforts mainly focus on a single modality, test-time distribution shift in the multi-modal setting is more complex and calls for new solutions. This paper tackles the problem of multi-modal test-time adaptation by proposing a novel method named Attention Bootstrapping with Principal Entropy Minimization (ABPEM). We observe that test-time distribution shift causes misalignment across modalities, leading to a large gap between intra-modality discrepancies (measured by self-attention) and inter-modality discrepancies (measured by cross-attention). We name this the attention gap. This attention gap widens with more severe distribution shifts, hindering effective modality fusion. To mitigate this attention gap and encourage better modality fusion, we propose attention bootstrapping that promotes cross-attention with the guidance of self-attention. Moreover, to reduce the gradient noise in the commonly-used entropy minimization, we adopt principal entropy minimization, a refinement of entropy minimization that reduces gradient noise by focusing on the principal parts of entropy, excluding less reliable gradient information. Extensive experiments on the benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed ABPEM in comparison with competing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Methods: We developed a computational framework based on biharmonic energy minimization for skinning weight calculation, incorporating volumetric discretization through tetrahedral mesh generation. The method implements temporal sampling and interpolation for continuous vessel deformation throughout the cardiac cycle, with mechanical constraints and volume conservation enforcement. The framework was validated using clinical datasets from 5 patients, comparing interpolated deformation results against ground truth data obtained from frame-by-frame segmentation across cardiac phases. Results: The proposed framework effectively handled interactive vessel manipulation. Geometric accuracy evaluation showed mean Hausdorff distance of 4.96 +- 1.78 mm and mean surface distance of 1.78 +- 0.75 mm between interpolated meshes and ground truth models. The Branch Completeness Ratio achieved 1.82 +- 0.46, while Branch Continuity Score maintained 0.84 +- 0.06 (scale 0-1) across all datasets. The system demonstrated capability in supporting real-time guidewire-vessel collision detection and contrast medium flow simulation throughout the complete coronary tree structure. Conclusion: Our skinning weight-based methodology enhances model interactivity and applicability while maintaining geometric accuracy. The framework provides a more flexible technical foundation for virtual surgical training systems, demonstrating promising potential for both clinical practice and medical education applications.

| **[ADMM-MCBF-LCA: A Layered Control Architecture for Safe Real-Time Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02208v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of safe real-time navigation of a robot in a dynamic environment with moving obstacles of arbitrary smooth geometries and input saturation constraints. We assume that the robot detects and models nearby obstacle boundaries with a short-range sensor and that this detection is error-free. This problem presents three main challenges: i) input constraints, ii) safety, and iii) real-time computation. To tackle all three challenges, we present a layered control architecture (LCA) consisting of an offline path library generation layer, and an online path selection and safety layer. To overcome the limitations of reactive methods, our offline path library consists of feasible controllers, feedback gains, and reference trajectories. To handle computational burden and safety, we solve online path selection and generate safe inputs that run at 100 Hz. Through simulations on Gazebo and Fetch hardware in an indoor environment, we evaluate our approach against baselines that are layered, end-to-end, or reactive. Our experiments demonstrate that among all algorithms, only our proposed LCA is able to complete tasks such as reaching a goal, safely. When comparing metrics such as safety, input error, and success rate, we show that our approach generates safe and feasible inputs throughout the robot execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subgraph Counting in Subquadratic Time for Bounded Degeneracy Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08376v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the classic problem of subgraph counting, where we wish to determine the number of occurrences of a fixed pattern graph $H$ in an input graph $G$ of $n$ vertices. Our focus is on bounded degeneracy inputs, a rich family of graph classes that also characterizes real-world massive networks. Building on the seminal techniques introduced by Chiba-Nishizeki (SICOMP 1985), a recent line of work has built subgraph counting algorithms for bounded degeneracy graphs. Assuming fine-grained complexity conjectures, there is a complete characterization of patterns $H$ for which linear time subgraph counting is possible. For every $r \geq 6$, there exists an $H$ with $r$ vertices that cannot be counted in linear time. In this paper, we initiate a study of subquadratic algorithms for subgraph counting on bounded degeneracy graphs. We prove that when $H$ has at most $9$ vertices, subgraph counting can be done in $\tilde{O}(n^{5/3})$ time. As a secondary result, we give improved algorithms for counting cycles of length at most $10$. Previously, no subquadratic algorithms were known for the above problems on bounded degeneracy graphs. Our main conceptual contribution is a framework that reduces subgraph counting in bounded degeneracy graphs to counting smaller hypergraphs in arbitrary graphs. We believe that our results will help build a general theory of subgraph counting for bounded degeneracy graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Safety Alignment: Inference-Time Adaptation to Diverse Safety Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08968v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current paradigm for safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) follows a one-size-fits-all approach: the model refuses to interact with any content deemed unsafe by the model provider. This approach lacks flexibility in the face of varying social norms across cultures and regions. In addition, users may have diverse safety needs, making a model with static safety standards too restrictive to be useful, as well as too costly to be re-aligned. We propose Controllable Safety Alignment (CoSA), a framework designed to adapt models to diverse safety requirements without re-training. Instead of aligning a fixed model, we align models to follow safety configs -- free-form natural language descriptions of the desired safety behaviors -- that are provided as part of the system prompt. To adjust model safety behavior, authorized users only need to modify such safety configs at inference time. To enable that, we propose CoSAlign, a data-centric method for aligning LLMs to easily adapt to diverse safety configs. Furthermore, we devise a novel controllability evaluation protocol that considers both helpfulness and configured safety, summarizing them into CoSA-Score, and construct CoSApien, a human-authored benchmark that consists of real-world LLM use cases with diverse safety requirements and corresponding evaluation prompts. We show that CoSAlign leads to substantial gains of controllability over strong baselines including in-context alignment. Our framework encourages better representation and adaptation to pluralistic human values in LLMs, and thereby increasing their practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 camera ready</p></details> |

PanelMatch is an R package that implements a set of tools enabling researchers to apply matching methods for causal inference with time-series cross-sectional data. Relative to other commonly used methods for longitudinal analyses, like regression with fixed effects, the matching-based approach implemented in PanelMatch makes fewer parametric assumptions and offers more diagnostics. In this paper, we discuss the PanelMatch package, showing users a recommended pipeline for doing causal inference analysis with it and highlighting useful diagnostic and visualization tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Search for Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02039v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have shown promising generative capabilities across diverse domains, yet aligning their outputs with desired reward functions remains a challenge, particularly in cases where reward functions are non-differentiable. Some gradient-free guidance methods have been developed, but they often struggle to achieve optimal inference-time alignment. In this work, we newly frame inference-time alignment in diffusion as a search problem and propose Dynamic Search for Diffusion (DSearch), which subsamples from denoising processes and approximates intermediate node rewards. It also dynamically adjusts beam width and tree expansion to efficiently explore high-reward generations. To refine intermediate decisions, DSearch incorporates adaptive scheduling based on noise levels and a lookahead heuristic function. We validate DSearch across multiple domains, including biological sequence design, molecular optimization, and image generation, demonstrating superior reward optimization compared to existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete-Time Hybrid Automata Learning: Legged Locomotion Meets Skateboarding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01842v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Discrete-time Hybrid Automata Learning (DHAL), a framework using on-policy Reinforcement Learning to identify and execute mode-switching without trajectory segmentation or event function learning. Hybrid dynamical systems, which include continuous flow and discrete mode switching, can model robotics tasks like legged robot locomotion. Model-based methods usually depend on predefined gaits, while model-free approaches lack explicit mode-switching knowledge. Current methods identify discrete modes via segmentation before regressing continuous flow, but learning high-dimensional complex rigid body dynamics without trajectory labels or segmentation is a challenging open problem. Our approach incorporates a beta policy distribution and a multi-critic architecture to model contact-guided motions, exemplified by a challenging quadrupedal robot skateboard task. We validate our method through simulations and real-world tests, demonstrating robust performance in hybrid dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[EAGLE-3: Scaling up Inference Acceleration of Large Language Models via Training-Time Test](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01840v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequential nature of modern LLMs makes them expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has proven to be an effective solution to this problem. Methods like EAGLE perform autoregression at the feature level, reusing top-layer features from the target model to achieve better results than vanilla speculative sampling. A growing trend in the LLM community is scaling up training data to improve model intelligence without increasing inference costs. However, we observe that scaling up data provides limited improvements for EAGLE. We identify that this limitation arises from EAGLE's feature prediction constraints. In this paper, we introduce EAGLE-3, which abandons feature prediction in favor of direct token prediction and replaces reliance on top-layer features with multi-layer feature fusion via a technique named training-time test. These improvements significantly enhance performance and enable the draft model to fully benefit from scaling up training data. Our experiments include both chat models and reasoning models, evaluated on five tasks. The results show that EAGLE-3 achieves a speedup ratio up to 6.5x, with about 1.4x improvement over EAGLE-2.

Recent advances in open-vocabulary vision models have resulted in semantically-informed object navigation methods that allow a robot to search for an arbitrary object without prior training. However, these zero-shot methods have so far treated the environment as unknown for each consecutive query. In this paper we introduce a new benchmark for zero-shot multi-object navigation, allowing the robot to leverage information gathered from previous searches to more efficiently find new objects. To address this problem we build a reusable open-vocabulary feature map tailored for real-time object search. We further propose a probabilistic-semantic map update that mitigates common sources of errors in semantic feature extraction and leverage this semantic uncertainty for informed multi-object exploration. We evaluate our method on a set of object navigation tasks in both simulation as well as with a real robot, running in real-time on a Jetson Orin AGX. We demonstrate that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches both on single and multi-object navigation tasks. Additional videos, code and the multi-object navigation benchmark will be available on https://finnbsch.github.io/OneMap.</p></details> |  |

These gaps arise from sensor malfunctions, blackouts, and human error and are typically addressed by data imputation. Previous work has tackled the imputation of missing data in random, complete blackouts and forecasting scenarios. The current paper addresses a more general missing pattern, which we call "partial blackout," where a subset of features is missing for consecutive time steps. We introduce a two-stage imputation process using self-attention and diffusion processes to model feature and temporal correlations. Notably, our model effectively handles missing data during training, enhancing adaptability and ensuring reliable imputation and performance, even with incomplete datasets. Our experiments on benchmark and two real-world time series datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art in partial blackout scenarios and shows better scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in AAAI 2025 Main Track</p></details> |

Our study is motivated by the fact that, with unbounded Lindbladian, projecting the evolution onto a finite-dimensional subspace using a Galerkin approximation inherently introduces stiffness, leading to a Courant--Friedrichs--Lewy type condition for explicit integration schemes. We propose and establish the convergence of a family of explicit numerical schemes for time discretization adapted to infinite dimension. These schemes correspond to quantum channels and thus preserve the physical properties of quantum evolutions on the set of density operators: linearity, complete positivity and trace. Numerical experiments inspired by bosonic quantum codes illustrate the practical interest of this approach when approximating the solution of infinite dimensional problems by that of finite dimensional problems of increasing dimension.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Continual Learning Framework for Multivariate Time Series Prediction Tasks with Application to Vehicle State Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01669v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In continual time series analysis using neural networks, catastrophic forgetting (CF) of previously learned models when training on new data domains has always been a significant challenge. This problem is especially challenging in vehicle estimation and control, where new information is sequentially introduced to the model. Unfortunately, existing work on continual learning has not sufficiently addressed the adverse effects of catastrophic forgetting in time series analysis, particularly in multivariate output environments. In this paper, we present EM-ReSeleCT (Efficient Multivariate Representative Selection for Continual Learning in Time Series Tasks), an enhanced approach designed to handle continual learning in multivariate environments. Our approach strategically selects representative subsets from old and historical data and incorporates memory-based continual learning techniques with an improved optimization algorithm to adapt the pre-trained model on new information while preserving previously acquired information. Additionally, we develop a sequence-to-sequence transformer model (autoregressive model) specifically designed for vehicle state estimation. Moreover, we propose an uncertainty quantification framework using conformal prediction to assess the sensitivity of the memory size and to showcase the robustness of the proposed method. Experimental results from tests on an electric Equinox vehicle highlight the superiority of our method in continually learning new information while retaining prior knowledge, outperforming state-of-the-art continual learning methods. Furthermore, EM-ReSeleCT significantly reduces training time, a critical advantage in continual learning applications.</p></details> |  |

While successors like QwQ, Deepseek-R1 (R1) and LIMO replicate these advancements, whether these models truly possess test-time scaling capabilities remains underexplored. This study found that longer CoTs of these o1-like models do not consistently enhance accuracy; in fact, correct solutions are often shorter than incorrect ones for the same questions. Further investigation shows this phenomenon is closely related to models' self-revision capabilities - longer CoTs contain more self-revisions, which often lead to performance degradation. We then compare sequential and parallel scaling strategies on QwQ, R1 and LIMO, finding that parallel scaling achieves better coverage and scalability. Based on these insights, we propose Shortest Majority Vote, a method that combines parallel scaling strategies with CoT length characteristics, significantly improving models' test-time scalability compared to conventional majority voting approaches.</p></details> | Add the github link |

We can use these methods to represent given geometries, such as curves, meshes, or surfaces. This representation is achieved by splitting some bounding voxel recursively while further splitting only sub-voxels that intersect with the given geometry. It is fairly known that subdivision methods are more efficient than traversing a fine-grained voxel grid. In this short note, we propose another outlook on analyzing the construction time complexity of orthrees to represent implicitly defined geometries that are fibers (preimages) of some function. This complexity is indeed asymptotically better than traversing dense voxel grids, under certain conditions, which we specify in the note. In fact, the complexity is output sensitive, and is closely related to the Hausdorff measure and Hausdorff dimension of the resulting geometry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a General Time Series Anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15273v4)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection plays a vital role in a wide range of applications. Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset. The code is made available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/DADA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

The cascaded decoder architecture constrains object queries to update in the cascaded direction, only enabling object queries to learn relatively-limited information from image features. However, the challenges for object detection in natural scenes (e.g., extremely-small, heavily-occluded, and confusingly mixed with the background) require an object detection model to fully utilize image features, which motivates us to propose a new decoder architecture with the parallel Multi-time Inquiries (MI) mechanism. MI enables object queries to learn more comprehensive information, and our MI based model, MI-DETR, outperforms all existing DETR-like models on COCO benchmark under different backbones and training epochs, achieving +2.3 AP and +0.6 AP improvements compared to the most representative model DINO and SOTA model Relation-DETR under ResNet-50 backbone. In addition, a series of diagnostic and visualization experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, rationality, and interpretability of MI.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages,9 figures,accepted to CVPR2025</p></details> |

We provide the first axiomatic definition of decision trees. These axioms establish a firm mathematical foundation for studying decision tree problems. We refer to decision trees that satisfy the axioms as proper decision trees. We prove that only proper decision trees can be uniquely characterized as K-permutations. Since permutations are among the most well-studied combinatorial structures, this characterization provides a fundamental basis for analyzing the combinatorial and algorithmic properties of decision trees. As a result of this advancement, we develop the first provably correct polynomial-time algorithm for solving the optimal decision tree problem. Our algorithm is derived using a formal program derivation framework, which enables step-by-step equational reasoning to construct side-effect-free programs with guaranteed correctness. The derived algorithm is correct by construction and is applicable to decision tree problems defined by any splitting rules that adhere to the axioms and any objective functions that can be specified in a given form. Examples include the decision tree problems where splitting rules are defined by axis-parallel hyperplanes, arbitrary hyperplanes, and hypersurfaces. By extending the axioms, we can potentially address a broader range of problems. Moreover, the derived algorithm can easily accommodate various constraints, such as tree depth and leaf size, and is amenable to acceleration techniques such as thinning method.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Effects of Modeling Errors on Distributed Continuous-time Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06718v4)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper offers a comprehensive performance analysis of the distributed continuous-time filtering in the presence of modeling errors. First, we introduce two performance indices, namely the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. By leveraging the nominal performance index and the Frobenius norm of the modeling deviations, we derive the bounds of the estimation error covariance and the lower bound of the nominal performance index. Specifically, we reveal the effect of the consensus parameter on both bounds. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, an incorrect process noise covariance can lead to the divergence of the estimation error covariance. Moreover, we investigate the properties of the eigenvalues of the error dynamical matrix. Furthermore, we explore the magnitude relations between the nominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. Finally, we present some numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHRONOS: Compensating Hardware Related Overheads with Native Multi Timer Support for Real-Time Operating Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01444v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The management of timing constraints in a real-time operating system (RTOS) is usually realized through a global tick counter. This counter acts as the foundational time unit for all tasks in the systems. In order to establish a connection between a tick and an amount of elapsed time in the real world, often this tick counter is periodically incremented by a hardware timer. At a fixed interval, this timer generates an interrupt that increments the counter. In an RTOS, jobs can only become ready upon a timer tick. That means, during a tick interrupt, the tick counter will be incremented, jobs will be released, and potentially, a scheduling decision will be conducted to select a new job to be run. As this process naturally uses some processing time, it is beneficial regarding the system utilization to minimize the time spent in tick interrupts. In modern microcontrollers, multiple hardware timers are often available. To utilize multiple timers to reduce the overhead caused by tick interrupts, multiple methods are introduced in this paper. The number of interrupts that are triggered by these timers can then be reduced by mapping tasks to timers in such a manner that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all task periods in a subset is maximized, and the GCD is adopted as the interrupt interval of the timer. To find an optimal mapping of tasks to timers, an MIQCP-model is presented that minimizes the overall number of tick interrupts that occur in a system, while ensuring a correct task release behavior. The presented methods are implemented in FreeRTOS and evaluated on an embedded system. The evaluation of the methods show, that compared to the baseline implementation in FreeRTOS that uses a single timer with a fixed period, the presented methods can provide a significant reduction in overhead of up to $\approx10\times$ in peak and up to $\approx 6\times$ in average.</p></details> |  |

Best-of-N (BoN) sampling serves as a common scaling technique, broadening the search space for finding better solutions from the model distribution. However, traditional BoN requires N full generations, leading to high GPU memory overhead and time latency. Moreover, some methods depend on reward models, adding computational cost and limiting domain generalization. In this paper, we propose Self-Truncation Best-of-N (ST-BoN), a novel decoding method that avoids fully generating all samplings and eliminates the need for reward models. ST-BoN introduces early sampling consistency to estimate the most promising sample, truncating suboptimal ones to free memory and accelerate inference. This pushes the sampling-efficient test-time scaling. Compared to traditional BoN, ST-BoN can reduce dynamic GPU memory overhead by over 90% and time latency by 50%, while achieving comparable or even better performance across reasoning and open-ended domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Instead, we propose to view time series explainability as saliency maps over interpretable parts, leaning on established signal processing methodology on signal decomposition. Specifically, we propose a new method called FLEXtime that uses a bank of bandpass filters to split the time series into frequency bands. Then, we learn the combination of these bands that optimally explains the model's prediction. Our extensive evaluation shows that, on average, FLEXtime outperforms state-of-the-art explainability methods across a range of datasets. FLEXtime fills an important gap in the current time series explainability methodology and is a valuable tool for a wide range of time series such as EEG and audio.

In some applications these might be considered distortions to be removed, but in others it is important to model them because it would be ineffective, or interfere with an aesthetic choice, to simply remove them. In augmented reality applications where virtual content is composed into a live video feed, we can model noise, MB and DoF to make the virtual content visually consistent with the video. Existing methods for this typically suffer two main limitations. First, they require a camera calibration step to relate a known calibration target to the specific cameras response. Second, existing work require methods that can be (differentiably) tuned to the calibration, such as slow and specialized neural networks. We propose a method which estimates parameters for noise, MB and DoF instantly, which allows using off-the-shelf real-time simulation methods from e.g., a game engine in compositing augmented content. Our main idea is to unlock both features by showing how to use modern computer vision methods that can remove noise, MB and DoF from the video stream, essentially providing self-calibration. This allows to auto-tune any black-box real-time noise+MB+DoF method to deliver fast and high-fidelity augmentation consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (IEEEVR 2025).

Trained on a dataset comprising over 8,000 simulated flight trajectories across three key categories-Human Recognition, Symbol Understanding, and Reasoning-the model generates real-time 4D action commands based on first-person visual inputs and textual instructions. To further enhance performance in intricate scenarios, we propose CognitiveDrone-R1, which integrates an additional Vision-Language Model (VLM) reasoning module to simplify task directives prior to high-frequency control.

Cognitive augmentation, which leverages technology to enhance human abilities, offers promising solutions to these challenges. In this study, we investigate the potential of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for real-time music generation to enrich online meetings. We introduce Discussion Jockey 2, a system that dynamically produces background music in response to live conversation transcripts. Through a user study involving 14 participants in an online interview setting, we examine the system's impact on relaxation, concentration, and overall user experience. The findings reveal that AI-generated background music significantly enhances user relaxation (average score: 5.75/9) and concentration (average score: 5.86/9). This research underscores the promise of context-aware music generation in improving the quality of online communication and points to future directions for optimizing its implementation across various virtual environments.</p></details> |  |

However, the Mid-Frequency Spectrum Gap in the real-world time series, where the energy is concentrated at the low-frequency region while the middle-frequency band is negligible, hinders the ability of existing deep learning models to extract the crucial frequency information. Additionally, the shared Key-Frequency in multivariate time series, where different time series share indistinguishable frequency patterns, is rarely exploited by existing literature. This work introduces a novel module, Adaptive Mid-Frequency Energy Optimizer, based on convolution and residual learning, to emphasize the significance of mid-frequency bands. We also propose an Energy-based Key-Frequency Picking Block to capture shared Key-Frequency, which achieves superior inter-series modeling performance with fewer parameters. A novel Key-Frequency Enhanced Training strategy is employed to further enhance Key-Frequency modeling, where spectral information from other channels is randomly introduced into each channel. Our approach advanced multivariate time series forecasting on the challenging Traffic, ECL, and Solar benchmarks, reducing MSE by 4%, 6%, and 5% compared to the previous SOTA iTransformer.

| **[Decision-Focused Fine-Tuning of Time Series Foundation Models for Dispatchable Feeder Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01936v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models provide a universal solution for generating forecasts to support optimization problems in energy systems. Those foundation models are typically trained in a prediction-focused manner to maximize forecast quality. In contrast, decision-focused learning directly improves the resulting value of the forecast in downstream optimization rather than merely maximizing forecasting quality. The practical integration of forecast values into forecasting models is challenging, particularly when addressing complex applications with diverse instances, such as buildings. This becomes even more complicated when instances possess specific characteristics that require instance-specific, tailored predictions to increase the forecast value. To tackle this challenge, we use decision-focused fine-tuning within time series foundation models to offer a scalable and efficient solution for decision-focused learning applied to the dispatchable feeder optimization problem. To obtain more robust predictions for scarce building data, we use Moirai as a state-of-the-art foundation model, which offers robust and generalized results with few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparing the decision-focused fine-tuned Moirai with a state-of-the-art classical prediction-focused fine-tuning Morai, we observe an improvement of 9.45% in average total daily costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[OIPR: Evaluation for Time-series Anomaly Detection Inspired by Operator Interest](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01260v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing adoption of time-series anomaly detection (TAD) technology, numerous studies have employed deep learning-based detectors for analyzing time-series data in the fields of Internet services, industrial systems, and sensors. The selection and optimization of anomaly detectors strongly rely on the availability of an effective performance evaluation method for TAD. Since anomalies in time-series data often manifest as a sequence of points, conventional metrics that solely consider the detection of individual point are inadequate. Existing evaluation methods for TAD typically employ point-based or event-based metrics to capture the temporal context. However, point-based metrics tend to overestimate detectors that excel only in detecting long anomalies, while event-based metrics are susceptible to being misled by fragmented detection results. To address these limitations, we propose OIPR, a novel set of TAD evaluation metrics. It models the process of operators receiving detector alarms and handling faults, utilizing area under the operator interest curve to evaluate the performance of TAD algorithms. Furthermore, we build a special scenario dataset to compare the characteristics of different evaluation methods. Through experiments conducted on the special scenario dataset and five real-world datasets, we demonstrate the remarkable performance of OIPR in extreme and complex scenarios. It achieves a balance between point and event perspectives, overcoming their primary limitations and offering applicability to broader situations.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the manufacturing constraints of compact devices and the inherent physical principles of imaging, dToF depth maps are sparse and noisy. In this paper, we propose a novel video depth completion method, called SVDC, by fusing the sparse dToF data with the corresponding RGB guidance. Our method employs a multi-frame fusion scheme to mitigate the spatial ambiguity resulting from the sparse dToF imaging. Misalignment between consecutive frames during multi-frame fusion could cause blending between object edges and the background, which results in a loss of detail. To address this, we introduce an adaptive frequency selective fusion (AFSF) module, which automatically selects convolution kernel sizes to fuse multi-frame features. Our AFSF utilizes a channel-spatial enhancement attention (CSEA) module to enhance features and generates an attention map as fusion weights. The AFSF ensures edge detail recovery while suppressing high-frequency noise in smooth regions. To further enhance temporal consistency, We propose a cross-window consistency loss to ensure consistent predictions across different windows, effectively reducing flickering. Our proposed SVDC achieves optimal accuracy and consistency on the TartanAir and Dynamic Replica datasets.

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive surveys for test-time compute scaling. We trace the concept of test-time compute back to System-1 models. In System-1 models, test-time compute addresses distribution shifts and improves robustness and generalization through parameter updating, input modification, representation editing, and output calibration. In System-2 models, it enhances the model's reasoning ability to solve complex problems through repeated sampling, self-correction, and tree search. We organize this survey according to the trend of System-1 to System-2 thinking, highlighting the key role of test-time compute in the transition from System-1 models to weak System-2 models, and then to strong System-2 models. We also point out a few possible future directions.</p></details> | work in progress |

For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique. However, they are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs, but most existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DYGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and temporal variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DYGPROMPT through extensive experiments on four public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Existing time series foundation models often adopt methodologies from these fields without addressing the unique characteristics of time series data. In this paper, we identify two key challenges in cross-domain time series forecasting: the complexity of temporal patterns and semantic misalignment. To tackle these issues, we propose the ``Unify and Anchor" transfer paradigm, which disentangles frequency components for a unified perspective and incorporates external context as domain anchors for guided adaptation. Based on this framework, we introduce ContexTST, a Transformer-based model that employs a time series coordinator for structured representation and the Transformer blocks with a context-informed mixture-of-experts mechanism for effective cross-domain generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContexTST advances state-of-the-art forecasting performance while achieving strong zero-shot transferability across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables, conference under review</p></details> |

While this strategy avoids the need for tractable likelihoods, it often requires a large number of simulations and has been challenging to scale to time series data. Scientific simulators frequently emulate real-world dynamics through thousands of single-state transitions over time. We propose an SBI approach that can exploit such Markovian simulators by locally identifying parameters consistent with individual state transitions. We then compose these local results to obtain a posterior over parameters that align with the entire time series observation. We focus on applying this approach to neural posterior score estimation but also show how it can be applied, e.g., to neural likelihood (ratio) estimation. We demonstrate that our approach is more simulation-efficient than directly estimating the global posterior on several synthetic benchmark tasks and simulators used in ecology and epidemiology. Finally, we validate scalability and simulation efficiency of our approach by applying it to a high-dimensional Kolmogorov flow simulator with around one million data dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025), Singapore, 2025</p></details> |

However, the uncertainty in gaussian position and initialization parameters introduces challenges, often requiring extensive iterative convergence and resulting in redundant or insufficient gaussian representations. To address this, we introduce a novel adaptive densification method based on Fourier frequency domain analysis to establish gaussian priors for rapid convergence. Additionally, we propose constructing independent and unified sparse and dense maps, where a sparse map supports efficient tracking via Generalized Iterative Closest Point (GICP) and a dense map creates high-fidelity visual representations. This is the first SLAM system leveraging frequency domain analysis to achieve high-quality gaussian mapping in real-time. Experimental results demonstrate an average frame rate of 36 FPS on Replica and TUM RGB-D datasets, achieving competitive accuracy in both localization and mapping.</p></details> |  |

In computer vision, prototypical part models (ProtoPNets) have become the dominant model type to meet this need. Users can easily identify flaws in ProtoPNets, but fixing problems in a ProtoPNet requires slow, difficult retraining that is not guaranteed to resolve the issue. This problem is called the "interaction bottleneck." We solve the interaction bottleneck for ProtoPNets by simultaneously finding many equally good ProtoPNets (i.e., a draw from a "Rashomon set"). We show that our framework - called Proto-RSet - quickly produces many accurate, diverse ProtoPNets, allowing users to correct problems in real time while maintaining performance guarantees with respect to the training set. We demonstrate the utility of this method in two settings: 1) removing synthetic bias introduced to a bird identification model and 2) debugging a skin cancer identification model. This tool empowers non-machine-learning experts, such as clinicians or domain experts, to quickly refine and correct machine learning models without repeated retraining by machine learning experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

This study explores new strategies for mitigating quantum errors using artificial neural networks (ANN) and the Yang-Baxter equation (YBE). Unlike traditional error mitigation methods, which are computationally intensive, we investigate artificial error mitigation. We developed a novel method that combines ANN for noise mitigation combined with the YBE to generate noisy data. This approach effectively reduces noise in quantum simulations, enhancing the accuracy of the results. The YBE rigorously preserves quantum correlations and symmetries in spin chain simulations in certain classes of integrable lattice models, enabling effective compression of quantum circuits while retaining linear scalability with the number of qubits. This compression facilitates both full and partial implementations, allowing the generation of noisy quantum data on hardware alongside noiseless simulations using classical platforms. By introducing controlled noise through the YBE, we enhance the dataset for error mitigation. We train an ANN model on partial data from quantum simulations, demonstrating its effectiveness in mitigating errors in time-evolving quantum states, providing a scalable framework to enhance quantum computation fidelity, particularly in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by performing quantum time dynamics simulations using the Heisenberg XY Hamiltonian on real quantum devices.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generative Motion Infilling From Imprecisely Timed Keyframes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01016v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Keyframes are a standard representation for kinematic motion specification. Recent learned motion-inbetweening methods use keyframes as a way to control generative motion models, and are trained to generate life-like motion that matches the exact poses and timings of input keyframes. However, the quality of generated motion may degrade if the timing of these constraints is not perfectly consistent with the desired motion. Unfortunately, correctly specifying keyframe timings is a tedious and challenging task in practice. Our goal is to create a system that synthesizes high-quality motion from keyframes, even if keyframes are imprecisely timed. We present a method that allows constraints to be retimed as part of the generation process. Specifically, we introduce a novel model architecture that explicitly outputs a time-warping function to correct mistimed keyframes, and spatial residuals that add pose details. We demonstrate how our method can automatically turn approximately timed keyframe constraints into diverse, realistic motions with plausible timing and detailed submovements.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Eurographics 2025</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Multi-modal Time Series Prediction with LLM-in-the-Loop](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01013v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis provides essential insights for real-world system dynamics and informs downstream decision-making, yet most existing methods often overlook the rich contextual signals present in auxiliary modalities. To bridge this gap, we introduce TimeXL, a multi-modal prediction framework that integrates a prototype-based time series encoder with three collaborating Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver more accurate predictions and interpretable explanations. First, a multi-modal prototype-based encoder processes both time series and textual inputs to generate preliminary forecasts alongside case-based rationales. These outputs then feed into a prediction LLM, which refines the forecasts by reasoning over the encoder's predictions and explanations. Next, a reflection LLM compares the predicted values against the ground truth, identifying textual inconsistencies or noise. Guided by this feedback, a refinement LLM iteratively enhances text quality and triggers encoder retraining. This closed-loop workflow -- prediction, critique (reflect), and refinement -- continuously boosts the framework's performance and interpretability. Empirical evaluations on four real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeXL achieves up to 8.9\% improvement in AUC and produces human-centric, multi-modal explanations, highlighting the power of LLM-driven reasoning for time series prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Gradient Method with Applications in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09660v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-time-scale optimization is a framework introduced in Zeng et al. (2024) that abstracts a range of policy evaluation and policy optimization problems in reinforcement learning (RL). Akin to bi-level optimization under a particular type of stochastic oracle, the two-time-scale optimization framework has an upper level objective whose gradient evaluation depends on the solution of a lower level problem, which is to find the root of a strongly monotone operator. In this work, we propose a new method for solving two-time-scale optimization that achieves significantly faster convergence than the prior arts. The key idea of our approach is to leverage an averaging step to improve the estimates of the operators in both lower and upper levels before using them to update the decision variables. These additional averaging steps eliminate the direct coupling between the main variables, enabling the accelerated performance of our algorithm. We characterize the finite-time convergence rates of the proposed algorithm under various conditions of the underlying objective function, including strong convexity, Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition, and general non-convexity. These rates significantly improve over the best-known complexity of the standard two-time-scale stochastic approximation algorithm. When applied to RL, we show how the proposed algorithm specializes to novel online sample-based methods that surpass or match the performance of the existing state of the art. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical simulations in RL.</p></details> |  |

Latency issues and the challenge of inferring variable human strategies hinder their ability to make autonomous decisions without explicit instructions. Through experiments with current independent System 1 and System 2 methods, we validate the necessity of using Dual Process Theory (DPT) in real-time tasks. We propose DPT-Agent, a novel language agent framework that integrates System 1 and System 2 for efficient real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration. DPT-Agent's System 1 uses a Finite-state Machine (FSM) and code-as-policy for fast, intuitive, and controllable decision-making. DPT-Agent's System 2 integrates Theory of Mind (ToM) and asynchronous reflection to infer human intentions and perform reasoning-based autonomous decisions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DPT-Agent through further experiments with rule-based agents and human collaborators, showing significant improvements over mainstream LLM-based frameworks. DPT-Agent can effectively help LLMs convert correct slow thinking and reasoning into executable actions, thereby improving performance. To the best of our knowledge, DPT-Agent is the first language agent framework that achieves successful real-time simultaneous human-AI collaboration autonomously.

However, the presence of block missing data introduces significant challenges, often compromising the performance of predictive models. Traditional two-step approaches, which first impute missing values and then perform forecasting, are prone to error accumulation, particularly in complex multivariate settings characterized by high missing ratios and intricate dependency structures. In this work, we introduce S4M, an end-to-end time series forecasting framework that seamlessly integrates missing data handling into the Structured State Space Sequence (S4) model architecture. Unlike conventional methods that treat imputation as a separate preprocessing step, S4M leverages the latent space of S4 models to directly recognize and represent missing data patterns, thereby more effectively capturing the underlying temporal and multivariate dependencies. Our framework comprises two key components: the Adaptive Temporal Prototype Mapper (ATPM) and the Missing-Aware Dual Stream S4 (MDS-S4). The ATPM employs a prototype bank to derive robust and informative representations from historical data patterns, while the MDS-S4 processes these representations alongside missingness masks as dual input streams to enable accurate forecasting. Through extensive empirical evaluations on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that S4M consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results underscore the efficacy of our integrated approach in handling missing data, showcasing its robustness and superiority over traditional imputation-based methods. Our findings highlight the potential of S4M to advance reliable time series forecasting in practical applications, offering a promising direction for future research and deployment.

However, real-world applications often face challenges with incomplete modalities due to privacy concerns, efficiency needs, or hardware issues. Current methods, while effective, often necessitate retraining the model entirely to handle missing modalities, making them computationally intensive, particularly with large training datasets. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address this issue at test time without requiring retraining. We frame the problem as a test-time adaptation task, where the model adjusts to the available unlabeled data at test time. Our method, MiDl~(Mutual information with self-Distillation), encourages the model to be insensitive to the specific modality source present during testing by minimizing the mutual information between the prediction and the available modality. Additionally, we incorporate self-distillation to maintain the model's original performance when both modalities are available. MiDl represents the first self-supervised, online solution for handling missing modalities exclusively at test time. Through experiments with various pretrained models and datasets, MiDl demonstrates substantial performance improvement without the need for retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Patch-wise Structural Loss for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00877v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting has gained significant attention in machine learning due to its crucial role in various domains. However, most existing forecasting models rely heavily on point-wise loss functions like Mean Square Error, which treat each time step independently and neglect the structural dependencies inherent in time series data, making it challenging to capture complex temporal patterns accurately. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Patch-wise Structural (PS) loss, designed to enhance structural alignment by comparing time series at the patch level. Through leveraging local statistical properties, such as correlation, variance, and mean, PS loss captures nuanced structural discrepancies overlooked by traditional point-wise losses. Furthermore, it integrates seamlessly with point-wise loss, simultaneously addressing local structural inconsistencies and individual time-step errors. PS loss establishes a novel benchmark for accurately modeling complex time series data and provides a new perspective on time series loss function design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PS loss significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

To uniformly predict multidimensional time series, we generalize next token prediction, predominantly adopted for 1D token sequences, to multivariate next token prediction. The paradigm formulates various forecasting tasks as a long-context prediction problem. We opt for decoder-only Transformers that capture causal dependencies from varying-length contexts for unified forecasting, making predictions on non-stationary univariate time series, multivariate series with complicated dynamics and correlations, as well as covariate-informed contexts that include exogenous variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to capture fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series tokens (patches), which is further enhanced by deft position embedding for temporal causality and variable equivalence. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art performance across task-specific forecasting benchmarks through a unified approach. Based on large-scale pre-training, Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, making it a promising architecture for pre-trained time series models.

Existing methods typically generate short, isolated motions based on a single input sentence. However, human motions are continuous and can extend over long periods, carrying rich semantics. Creating long, complex motions that precisely respond to streams of text descriptions, particularly in an online and real-time setting, remains a significant challenge. Furthermore, incorporating spatial constraints into text-conditioned motion generation presents additional challenges, as it requires aligning the motion semantics specified by text descriptions with geometric information, such as goal locations and 3D scene geometry. To address these limitations, we propose DartControl, in short DART, a Diffusion-based Autoregressive motion primitive model for Real-time Text-driven motion control. Our model effectively learns a compact motion primitive space jointly conditioned on motion history and text inputs using latent diffusion models. By autoregressively generating motion primitives based on the preceding history and current text input, DART enables real-time, sequential motion generation driven by natural language descriptions. Additionally, the learned motion primitive space allows for precise spatial motion control, which we formulate either as a latent noise optimization problem or as a Markov decision process addressed through reinforcement learning. We present effective algorithms for both approaches, demonstrating our model's versatility and superior performance in various motion synthesis tasks. Experiments show our method outperforms existing baselines in motion realism, efficiency, and controllability.

However, the complexity of the allowed tasks for these planners is limited. On the other hand, signal temporal logic (STL) can specify complex requirements, but STL-based motion planning and control algorithms often face scalability issues, especially in large multi-robot systems with complex dynamics. In this paper, we propose an algorithm that leverages the best of the two worlds. We first use a single-robot motion planner to efficiently generate a set of alternative reference paths for each robot. Then coordination requirements are specified using STL, which is defined over the assignment of paths and robots' progress along those paths. We use a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) to compute task assignments and robot progress targets over time such that the STL specification is satisfied. Finally, a local controller is used to track the target progress. Simulations demonstrate that our method can handle tasks with complex constraints and scales to large multi-robot teams and intricate task allocation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Cycle Detection and Acyclic Temporization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02694v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In directed graphs, a cycle can be seen as a structure that allows its vertices to loop back to themselves, or as a structure that allows pairs of vertices to reach each other through distinct paths. We extend these concepts to temporal graph theory, resulting in multiple interesting definitions of a "temporal cycle". For each of these, we consider the problems of Cycle Detection and Acyclic Temporization. For the former, we are given an input temporal digraph, and we want to decide whether it contains a temporal cycle. Regarding the latter, for a given input (static) digraph, we want to time the arcs such that no temporal cycle exists in the resulting temporal digraph. We're also interested in Acyclic Temporization where we bound the lifetime of the resulting temporal digraph. Multiple results are presented, including polynomial and fixed-parameter tractable search algorithms, polynomial-time reductions from 3-SAT and Not All Equal 3-SAT, and temporizations resulting from arbitrary vertex orderings which cover (almost) all cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 9 figures, preprint version</p></details> |
| **[STAA-SNN: Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02689v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant attention due to their biological plausibility and energy efficiency, making them promising alternatives to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Notably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the static datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, our model exhibits improved performance ranging from 0.33\% to 2.80\% with fewer time steps. The code for the model is available on GitHub.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[ttta: Tools for Temporal Text Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02625v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text data is inherently temporal. The meaning of words and phrases changes over time, and the context in which they are used is constantly evolving. This is not just true for social media data, where the language used is rapidly influenced by current events, memes and trends, but also for journalistic, economic or political text data. Most NLP techniques however consider the corpus at hand to be homogenous in regard to time. This is a simplification that can lead to biased results, as the meaning of words and phrases can change over time. For instance, running a classic Latent Dirichlet Allocation on a corpus that spans several years is not enough to capture changes in the topics over time, but only portraits an "average" topic distribution over the whole time span. Researchers have developed a number of tools for analyzing text data over time. However, these tools are often scattered across different packages and libraries, making it difficult for researchers to use them in a consistent and reproducible way. The ttta package is supposed to serve as a collection of tools for analyzing text data over time.</p></details> | 4 pages, 2 figures |

To mitigate these issue, we explore an off-policy based Temporal Difference Approximate Dynamic Programming approach that preserves contraction mapping when projecting the problem into a subspace of selected features, accounting for the probability distribution of the perturbed transition probability matrix. We further demonstrate how this Approximate Dynamic Programming approach can be implemented as a particular variant of the Temporal Difference learning algorithm, adapted for handling perturbations. To validate our theoretical findings, we provide a numerical example using a Markov Decision Process corresponding to a resource allocation problem.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the majority of current BEV map generation studies focusing on visual map generation lack depth-aware reasoning capabilities. They exhibit limited efficacy in managing occlusions and handling complex environments, with a notable decline in perceptual performance under adverse weather conditions or low-light scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes TS-CGNet, which leverages Temporal-Spatial fusion with Centerline-Guided diffusion. This visual framework, grounded in prior knowledge, is designed for integration into any existing network for building BEV maps. Specifically, this framework is decoupled into three parts: Local mapping system involves the initial generation of semantic maps using purely visual information; The Temporal-Spatial Aligner Module (TSAM) integrates historical information into mapping generation by applying transformation matrices; The Centerline-Guided Diffusion Model (CGDM) is a prediction module based on the diffusion model. CGDM incorporates centerline information through spatial-attention mechanisms to enhance semantic segmentation reconstruction. We construct BEV semantic segmentation maps by our methods on the public nuScenes and the robustness benchmarks under various corruptions. Our method improves 1.90%, 1.73%, and 2.87% for perceived ranges of 60x30m, 120x60m, and 240x60m in the task of BEV HD mapping. TS-CGNet attains an improvement of 1.92% for perceived ranges of 100x100m in the task of BEV semantic mapping. Moreover, TS-CGNet achieves an average improvement of 2.92% in detection accuracy under varying weather conditions and sensor interferences in the perception range of 240x60m.

Conventional ego-motion sensors, such as cameras and LiDARs, may be compromised in adverse environmental conditions, such as fog, heavy rain, or dust. Automotive radars, known for their robustness to such conditions, present themselves as complementary sensors or a promising alternative within the ego-motion estimation frameworks. In this paper we propose a novel Radar-Inertial Odometry (RIO) system that integrates an automotive radar and an inertial measurement unit. The key contribution is the integration of online temporal delay calibration within the factor graph optimization framework that compensates for potential time offsets between radar and IMU measurements. To validate the proposed approach we have conducted thorough experimental analysis on real-world radar and IMU data. The results show that, even without scan matching or target tracking, integration of online temporal calibration significantly reduces localization error compared to systems that disregard time synchronization, thus highlighting the important role of, often neglected, accurate temporal alignment in radar-based sensor fusion systems for autonomous navigation.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024; The new version adds additional experiments and corrects typos</p></details> |

However, many works focus on tweaking existing 2D backbones due to the reliance of ImageNet pretraining, which restrains the models from achieving higher efficiency for video recognition. In this work we introduce a simple and very efficient 3D convolutional neural network for video action recognition. The design of the building block consists of a channel-wise convolution, followed by a spatial group convolution, and finally a temporal convolution. We evaluate the performance and efficiency of our proposed network on several video action recognition datasets by directly training on the target dataset without relying on pertaining. On Something-Something-V1&V2, Kinetics-400 and Multi-Moments in Time, our network can match or even surpass the performance of other models which are several times larger. On the fine-grained action recognition dataset FineGym, we beat the previous state-of-the-art accuracy achieved with 2-stream methods by more than 5% using only RGB input.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Multi-Task Temporal Difference Learning under Low-Rank Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02030v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study policy evaluation problems in multi-task reinforcement learning (RL) under a low-rank representation setting. In this setting, we are given $N$ learning tasks where the corresponding value function of these tasks lie in an $r$-dimensional subspace, with $r<N$. One can apply the classic temporal-difference (TD) learning method for solving these problems where this method learns the value function of each task independently. In this paper, we are interested in understanding whether one can exploit the low-rank structure of the multi-task setting to accelerate the performance of TD learning. To answer this question, we propose a new variant of TD learning method, where we integrate the so-called truncated singular value decomposition step into the update of TD learning. This additional step will enable TD learning to exploit the dominant directions due to the low rank structure to update the iterates, therefore, improving its performance. Our empirical results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the classic TD learning, where the performance gap increases as the rank $r$ decreases. From the theoretical point of view, introducing the truncated singular value decomposition step into TD learning might cause an instability on the updates. We provide a theoretical result showing that the instability does not happen. Specifically, we prove that the proposed method converges at a rate $\mathcal{O}(\frac{\ln(t)}{t})$, where $t$ is the number of iterations. This rate matches that of the standard TD learning.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19764v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spike-based Transformer presents a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based Transformers, achieving impressive results through sparse binary computations. However, existing spike-based transformers predominantly focus on spatial attention while neglecting crucial temporal dependencies inherent in spike-based processing, leading to suboptimal feature representation and limited performance. To address this limitation, we propose Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture that efficiently integrates both spatial and temporal information in the self-attention mechanism. STAtten introduces a block-wise computation strategy that processes information in spatial-temporal chunks, enabling comprehensive feature capture while maintaining the same computational complexity as previous spatial-only approaches. Our method can be seamlessly integrated into existing spike-based transformers without architectural overhaul. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STAtten significantly improves the performance of existing spike-based transformers across both static and neuromorphic datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101.

| **[Generating Counterfactual Explanations Under Temporal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01792v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual explanations are one of the prominent eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, and suggest changes to input data that could alter predictions, leading to more favourable outcomes. Existing counterfactual methods do not readily apply to temporal domains, such as that of process mining, where data take the form of traces of activities that must obey to temporal background knowledge expressing which dynamics are possible and which not. Specifically, counterfactuals generated off-the-shelf may violate the background knowledge, leading to inconsistent explanations. This work tackles this challenge by introducing a novel approach for generating temporally constrained counterfactuals, guaranteed to comply by design with background knowledge expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on process traces (LTLp). We do so by infusing automata-theoretic techniques for LTLp inside a genetic algorithm for counterfactual generation. The empirical evaluation shows that the generated counterfactuals are temporally meaningful and more interpretable for applications involving temporal dependencies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Real-life temporal graphs often introduce new node classes over time, but existing TGL methods assume a fixed set of classes. This assumption brings limitations, as updating models with full data is costly, while focusing only on new classes results in forgetting old ones. Graph continual learning (GCL) methods mitigate forgetting using old-class subsets but fail to account for their evolution. We define this novel problem as temporal graph continual learning (TGCL), which focuses on efficiently maintaining up-to-date knowledge of old classes. To tackle TGCL, we propose a selective learning framework that substitutes the old-class data with its subsets, Learning Towards the Future (LTF). We derive an upper bound on the error caused by such replacement and transform it into objectives for selecting and learning subsets that minimize classification error while preserving the distribution of the full old-class data. Experiments on three real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of LTF on TGCL.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Signal temporal logic (STL) is frequently used for this purpose due to its suitability in formalizing comprehensible, modular, and versatile spatiotemporal specifications. Due to scaling issues with respect to the complexity of the specifications and the potential occurrence of non-differentiable terms, classical optimization methods often solve STL-based problems inefficiently. Smoothing and approximation techniques can alleviate these issues but require changing the optimization problem. This paper proposes a novel sampling-based method based on model predictive path integral control to solve optimal control problems with STL cost functions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on benchmark motion planning problems and compare its performance with state-of-the-art methods.

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

Existing methods typically require centralized data collection, which poses significant privacy and communication challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that enables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple clients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents video LLM outputs as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE process visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Recent researches demonstrate data-driven neural networks surpass traditional statistical methods, especially when the analytical form of signals is hard to obtain, or noise is significant. However, most densely connected or convolution-based networks fail to fully exploit the spectral and temporal structure of scintillation signals, leaving large space for performance improvement. In this paper, we propose a network architecture specially tailored for scintillation pulse characterization based on previous works on time series analysis. The core insight is that, by directly applying Fast Fourier Transform on original signals and utilizing different frequency components, the proposed network architecture can serve as a lightweight and enhanced representation learning backbone. We prove our idea in two case studies: (a) simulation data generated with the setting of the LUX dark matter detector, and (b) experimental electrical signals with fast electronics to emulate scintillation variations for the NICA/MPD calorimeter. The proposed model achieves significantly better results than the reference model in literature and densely connected models, and demonstrates higher cost-efficiency than conventional machine learning methods.</p></details> | 29 pages, 14 figures |

Accurate prediction of pavement distress deterioration is essential for effective road management, cost reduction in maintenance, and improvement of traffic safety. However, real-world data on pavement distress is usually collected irregularly, resulting in uneven, asynchronous, and sparse spatial-temporal datasets. This hinders the application of existing spatial-temporal models, such as DCRNN, since they are only applicable to regularly and synchronously collected data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Graph Autoregression Network (STGAN), a novel graph neural network model designed for accurately predicting irregular pavement distress deterioration using complex spatial-temporal data. Specifically, STGAN integrates the temporal domain into the spatial domain, creating a larger graph where nodes are represented by spatial-temporal tuples and edges are formed based on a similarity-based connection mechanism. Furthermore, based on the constructed spatiotemporal graph, we formulate pavement distress deterioration prediction as a graph autoregression task, i.e., the graph size increases incrementally and the prediction is performed sequentially. This is accomplished by a novel spatial-temporal attention mechanism deployed by STGAN. Utilizing the ConTrack dataset, which contains pavement distress records collected from different locations in Shanghai, we demonstrate the superior performance of STGAN in capturing spatial-temporal correlations and addressing the aforementioned challenges. Experimental results further show that STGAN outperforms baseline models, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of its novel modules. Our findings contribute to promoting proactive road maintenance decision-making and ultimately enhancing road safety and resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (TITS)</p></details> |

We explore this challenge in the traditional offline RL setting, where an agent must learn how to make decisions based on data collected through a stochastic behavior policy. We present Latent Macro Action Planner (L-MAP), which addresses this challenge by learning a set of temporally extended macro-actions through a state-conditional Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), effectively reducing action dimensionality. L-MAP employs a (separate) learned prior model that acts as a latent transition model and allows efficient sampling of plausible actions. During planning, our approach accounts for stochasticity in both the environment and the behavior policy by using Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). In offline RL settings, including stochastic continuous control tasks, L-MAP efficiently searches over discrete latent actions to yield high expected returns. Empirical results demonstrate that L-MAP maintains low decision latency despite increased action dimensionality. Notably, across tasks ranging from continuous control with inherently stochastic dynamics to high-dimensional robotic hand manipulation, L-MAP significantly outperforms existing model-based methods and performs on-par with strong model-free actor-critic baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed approach in planning in complex and stochastic environments with high-dimensional action spaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR2025.

However, learning the underlying SDE from data is a challenging task, especially if individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly identifying the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution lacks any generalized rotational symmetries. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that APPEX iteratively decreases Kullback-Leibler divergence to the true solution, and demonstrate its effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods often overlook the critical importance of preserving symmetry when generating scene graphs from 3D point clouds, which can lead to reduced accuracy and robustness, particularly when dealing with noisy, multi-view data. Furthermore, a major limitation of prior approaches is the lack of temporal modeling to capture time-dependent relationships among dynamically evolving entities in a scene. To address these challenges, we propose Temporal Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (TESGNN), consisting of two key components: (1) an Equivariant Scene Graph Neural Network (ESGNN), which extracts information from 3D point clouds to generate scene graph while preserving crucial symmetry properties, and (2) a Temporal Graph Matching Network, which fuses scene graphs generated by ESGNN across multiple time sequences into a unified global representation using an approximate graph-matching algorithm. Our combined architecture TESGNN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in scene graph generation, achieving higher accuracy and faster training convergence. Moreover, we show that leveraging the symmetry-preserving property produces a more stable and accurate global scene representation compared to existing approaches. Last but not least, it is computationally efficient and easily implementable using existing frameworks, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision. This approach paves the way for more robust and scalable solutions to complex multi-view scene understanding challenges.

| **[Dynamical Diffusion: Learning Temporal Dynamics with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00951v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as powerful generative frameworks by progressively adding noise to data through a forward process and then reversing this process to generate realistic samples. While these models have achieved strong performance across various tasks and modalities, their application to temporal predictive learning remains underexplored. Existing approaches treat predictive learning as a conditional generation problem, but often fail to fully exploit the temporal dynamics inherent in the data, leading to challenges in generating temporally coherent sequences. To address this, we introduce Dynamical Diffusion (DyDiff), a theoretically sound framework that incorporates temporally aware forward and reverse processes. Dynamical Diffusion explicitly models temporal transitions at each diffusion step, establishing dependencies on preceding states to better capture temporal dynamics.

Recent studies on automating this labor-intensive process through video-to-sound generation face significant challenges. Systems lacking explicit temporal features suffer from poor alignment and controllability, while timestamp-based models require costly and subjective human annotation. We propose Video-Foley, a video-to-sound system using Root Mean Square (RMS) as an intuitive condition with semantic timbre prompts (audio or text). RMS, a frame-level intensity envelope closely related to audio semantics, acts as a temporal event feature to guide audio generation from video. The annotation-free self-supervised learning framework consists of two stages, Video2RMS and RMS2Sound, incorporating novel ideas including RMS discretization and RMS-ControlNet with a pretrained text-to-audio model. Our extensive evaluation shows that Video-Foley achieves state-of-the-art performance in audio-visual alignment and controllability for sound timing, intensity, timbre, and nuance. Source code, model weights and demos are available on our companion website. (https://jnwnlee.github.io/video-foley-demo)</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Audio-Visual Adversarial Vulnerability from Temporal and Modality Perspectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11858v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While audio-visual learning equips models with a richer understanding of the real world by leveraging multiple sensory modalities, this integration also introduces new vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of the adversarial robustness of audio-visual models, considering both temporal and modality-specific vulnerabilities. We propose two powerful adversarial attacks: 1) a temporal invariance attack that exploits the inherent temporal redundancy across consecutive time segments and 2) a modality misalignment attack that introduces incongruence between the audio and visual modalities. These attacks are designed to thoroughly assess the robustness of audio-visual models against diverse threats. Furthermore, to defend against such attacks, we introduce a novel audio-visual adversarial training framework. This framework addresses key challenges in vanilla adversarial training by incorporating efficient adversarial perturbation crafting tailored to multi-modal data and an adversarial curriculum strategy. Extensive experiments in the Kinetics-Sounds dataset demonstrate that our proposed temporal and modality-based attacks in degrading model performance can achieve state-of-the-art performance, while our adversarial training defense largely improves the adversarial robustness as well as the adversarial training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However,most studies remain constrained by assumption of temporal stationarity in neural activity,resulting in predominantly block-wise analysis with limited temporal resolution on the order of tens of seconds. This limitation restricts the ability to decode cognitive functions in detail. To address these limitations, this study proposes a deep neural network designed for volume-wise identification of task states within tfMRI data,thereby overcoming the constraints of conventional methods. Evaluated on Human Connectome Project (HCP) motor and gambling tfMRI datasets,the model achieved impressive mean accuracy rates of 94.0% and 79.6%,respectively. These results demonstrate a substantial enhancement in temporal resolution,enabling more detailed exploration of cognitive processes. The study further employs visualization algorithms to investigate dynamic brain mappings during different tasks,marking a significant step forward in deep learning-based frame-level tfMRI decoding. This approach offers new methodologies and tools for examining dynamic changes in brain activities and understanding the underlying cognitive mechanisms.</p></details> | 8 pages,11 figures |

These interactions can be effectively represented as time-evolving graphs, where predicting future connections is a key task in applications such as recommendation systems. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have achieved strong results for such predictive tasks but typically require extensive training data, which is often limited in real-world scenarios. One approach to mitigating data scarcity is leveraging pre-trained models from related datasets. However, direct knowledge transfer between TGNNs is challenging due to their reliance on node-specific memory structures, making them inherently difficult to adapt across datasets. To address this, we introduce a novel transfer approach that disentangles node representations from their associated features through a structured bipartite encoding mechanism. This decoupling enables more effective transfer of memory components and other learned inductive patterns from one dataset to another. Empirical evaluations on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly enhances TGNN performance in low-data regimes, outperforming non-transfer baselines by up to 56\% and surpassing existing transfer strategies by 36\%</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review in SIGIR conference</p></details> |

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling and Analysis of Spatial and Temporal Land Clutter Statistics in SAR Imaging Based on MSTAR Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03816v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The statistical analysis of land clutter for Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging has become an increasingly important subject for research and investigation. It is also absolutely necessary for designing robust algorithms capable of performing the task of target detection in the background clutter. Any attempt to extract the energy of the desired targets from the land clutter requires complete knowledge of the statistical properties of the background clutter. In this paper, the spatial as well as the temporal characteristics of the land clutter are studied. Since the data for each image has been collected based on a different aspect angle; therefore, the temporal analysis contains variation in the aspect angle. Consequently, the temporal analysis includes the characteristics of the radar cross section with respect to the aspect angle based on which the data has been collected. In order to perform the statistical analysis, several well-known and relevant distributions, namely, Weibull, Log-normal, Gamma, and Rayleigh are considered as prime candidates to model the land clutter. The goodness-of-fit test is based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence metric. The detailed analysis presented in this paper demonstrates that the Weibull distribution is a more accurate fit for the temporal-aspect-angle statistical analysis while the Rayleigh distribution models the spatial characteristics of the background clutter with higher accuracy. Finally, based on the aforementioned statistical analyses and by utilizing the Constant False Alarm Rate (CFAR) algorithm, we perform target detection in land clutter. The overall verification of the analysis is performed by exploiting the Moving and Stationary Target Acquisition and Recognition (MSTAR) data-set, which has been collected in spotlight mode at X-band, and the results are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.02155</p></details> |
| **[MoSFormer: Augmenting Temporal Context with Memory of Surgery for Surgical Phase Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00695v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical phase recognition from video enables various downstream applications. Transformer-based sliding window approaches have set the state-of-the-art by capturing rich spatial-temporal features. However, while transformers can theoretically handle arbitrary-length sequences, in practice they are limited by memory and compute constraints, resulting in fixed context windows that struggle with maintaining temporal consistency across lengthy surgical procedures. This often leads to fragmented predictions and limited procedure-level understanding. To address these challenges, we propose Memory of Surgery (MoS), a framework that enriches temporal modeling by incorporating both semantic interpretable long-term surgical history and short-term impressions. MoSFormer, our enhanced transformer architecture, integrates MoS using a carefully designed encoding and fusion mechanism. We further introduce step filtering to refine history representation and develop a memory caching pipeline to improve training and inference stability, mitigating shortcut learning and overfitting. MoSFormer demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks. On the Challenging BernBypass70 benchmark, it attains 88.0 video-level accuracy and phase-level metrics of 70.7 precision, 68.7 recall, and 66.3 F1 score, outperforming its baseline with 2.1 video-level accuracy and phase-level metrics of 4.6 precision, 3.6 recall, and 3.8 F1 score. Further studies confirms the individual and combined benefits of long-term and short-term memory components through ablation and counterfactual inference. Qualitative results shows improved temporal consistency. The augmented temporal context enables procedure-level understanding, paving the way for more comprehensive surgical video analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[LNUCB-TA: Linear-nonlinear Hybrid Bandit Learning with Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00387v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing contextual multi-armed bandit (MAB) algorithms fail to effectively capture both long-term trends and local patterns across all arms, leading to suboptimal performance in environments with rapidly changing reward structures. They also rely on static exploration rates, which do not dynamically adjust to changing conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose LNUCB-TA, a hybrid bandit model integrating a novel nonlinear component (adaptive k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)) for reducing time complexity, alongside a global-and-local attention-based exploration mechanism. Our approach uniquely combines linear and nonlinear estimation techniques, with the nonlinear module dynamically adjusting k based on reward variance to enhance spatiotemporal pattern recognition. This reduces the likelihood of selecting suboptimal arms while improving reward estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. The attention-based mechanism ranks arms by past performance and selection frequency, dynamically adjusting exploration and exploitation in real time without requiring manual tuning of exploration rates. By integrating global attention (assessing all arms collectively) and local attention (focusing on individual arms), LNUCB-TA efficiently adapts to temporal and spatial complexities. Empirical results show LNUCB-TA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art linear, nonlinear, and hybrid bandits in cumulative and mean reward, convergence, and robustness across different exploration rates. Theoretical analysis further confirms its reliability with a sub-linear regret bound.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

| **[ReX: A Framework for Incorporating Temporal Information in Model-Agnostic Local Explanation Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03798v3)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing local model-agnostic explanation techniques are ineffective for machine learning models that consider inputs of variable lengths, as they do not consider temporal information embedded in these models. To address this limitation, we propose \textsc{ReX}, a general framework for incorporating temporal information in these techniques. Our key insight is that these techniques typically learn a model surrogate by sampling model inputs and outputs, and we can incorporate temporal information in a uniform way by only changing the sampling process and the surrogate features. We instantiate our approach on three popular explanation techniques: Anchors, LIME, and Kernel SHAP. To evaluate the effectiveness of \textsc{ReX}, we apply our approach to six models in three different tasks. Our evaluation results demonstrate that our approach 1) significantly improves the fidelity of explanations, making model-agnostic techniques outperform a state-of-the-art model-specific technique on its target model, and 2) helps end users better understand the models' behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Inference for Spatial-temporal Non-Gaussian Data Using Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04655v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analysing non-Gaussian spatial-temporal data typically requires introducing spatial dependence in generalised linear models through the link function of an exponential family distribution. However, unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise an approach that obviates these issues by exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some fixed process parameters. More specifically, we expand upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors to achieve analytically tractable posterior inference for spatially-temporally varying regression models conditional on some kernel parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference from these individual posterior distributions over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with fully Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo and apply our proposed method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</p></details> | 31 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Revisiting a Design Choice in Gradient Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01170v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy learning enables a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to reason counterfactually about policies that are not executed and is one of the most important ideas in RL. It, however, can lead to instability when combined with function approximation and bootstrapping, two arguably indispensable ingredients for large-scale reinforcement learning. This is the notorious deadly triad. The seminal work Sutton et al. (2008) pioneers Gradient Temporal Difference learning (GTD) as the first solution to the deadly triad, which has enjoyed massive success thereafter. During the derivation of GTD, some intermediate algorithm, called $A^\top$TD, was invented but soon deemed inferior. In this paper, we revisit this $A^\top$TD and prove that a variant of $A^\top$TD, called $A_t^\top$TD, is also an effective solution to the deadly triad. Furthermore, this $A_t^\top$TD only needs one set of parameters and one learning rate. By contrast, GTD has two sets of parameters and two learning rates, making it hard to tune in practice. We provide asymptotic analysis for $A^\top_t$TD and finite sample analysis for a variant of $A^\top_t$TD that additionally involves a projection operator. The convergence rate of this variant is on par with the canonical on-policy temporal difference learning.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[TRENDy: Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03496v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal dynamics pervade the natural sciences, from the morphogen dynamics underlying patterning in animal pigmentation to the protein waves controlling cell division. A central challenge lies in understanding how controllable parameters induce qualitative changes in system behavior called bifurcations. This endeavor is particularly difficult in realistic settings where governing partial differential equations (PDEs) are unknown and data is limited and noisy. To address this challenge, we propose TRENDy (Temporal Regression of Effective Nonlinear Dynamics), an equation-free approach to learning low-dimensional, predictive models of spatiotemporal dynamics. TRENDy first maps input data to a low-dimensional space of effective dynamics through a cascade of multiscale filtering operations. Our key insight is the recognition that these effective dynamics can be fit by a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) having the same parameter space as the input PDE. The preceding filtering operations strongly regularize the phase space of the NODE, making TRENDy significantly more robust to noise compared to existing methods. We train TRENDy to predict the effective dynamics of synthetic and real data representing dynamics from across the physical and life sciences. We then demonstrate how we can automatically locate both Turing and Hopf bifurcations in unseen regions of parameter space. We finally apply our method to the analysis of spatial patterning of the ocellated lizard through development. We found that TRENDy's predicted effective state not only accurately predicts spatial changes over time but also identifies distinct pattern features unique to different anatomical regions, such as the tail, neck, and body--an insight that highlights the potential influence of surface geometry on reaction-diffusion mechanisms and their role in driving spatially varying pattern dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 14 appendix pages, 5 figures, 7 appendix figures.

| **[A Survey of Link Prediction in Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21185v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks have gained significant prominence in the past decade for modelling dynamic interactions within complex systems. A key challenge in this domain is Temporal Link Prediction (TLP), which aims to forecast future connections by analysing historical network structures across various applications including social network analysis. While existing surveys have addressed specific aspects of TLP, they typically lack a comprehensive framework that distinguishes between representation and inference methods. This survey bridges this gap by introducing a novel taxonomy that explicitly examines representation and inference from existing methods, providing a novel classification of approaches for TLP. We analyse how different representation techniques capture temporal and structural dynamics, examining their compatibility with various inference methods for both transductive and inductive prediction tasks. Our taxonomy not only clarifies the methodological landscape but also reveals promising unexplored combinations of existing techniques. This taxonomy provides a systematic foundation for emerging challenges in TLP, including model explainability and scalable architectures for complex temporal networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting clinical outcomes from patient care pathways represented with temporal knowledge graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21138v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: With the increasing availability of healthcare data, predictive modeling finds many applications in the biomedical domain, such as the evaluation of the level of risk for various conditions, which in turn can guide clinical decision making. However, it is unclear how knowledge graph data representations and their embedding, which are competitive in some settings, could be of interest in biomedical predictive modeling. Method: We simulated synthetic but realistic data of patients with intracranial aneurysm and experimented on the task of predicting their clinical outcome. We compared the performance of various classification approaches on tabular data versus a graph-based representation of the same data. Next, we investigated how the adopted schema for representing first individual data and second temporal data impacts predictive performances. Results: Our study illustrates that in our case, a graph representation and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) embeddings reach the best performance for a predictive task from observational data. We emphasize the importance of the adopted schema and of the consideration of literal values in the representation of individual data. Our study also moderates the relative impact of various time encoding on GCN performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Realizing temporal transportation trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18513v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study the complexity of the periodic temporal graph realization problem with respect to upper bounds on the fastest path durations among its vertices. This constraint with respect to upper bounds appears naturally in transportation network design applications where, for example, a road network is given, and the goal is to appropriately schedule periodic travel routes, while not exceeding some desired upper bounds on the travel times. In our work, we focus only on underlying tree topologies, which are fundamental in many transportation network applications. As it turns out, the periodic upper-bounded temporal tree realization problem (TTR) has a very different computational complexity behavior than both (i) the classic graph realization problem with respect to shortest path distances in static graphs and (ii) the periodic temporal graph realization problem with exact given fastest travel times (which was recently introduced). First, we prove that, surprisingly, TTR is NP-hard, even for a constant period $\Delta$ and when the input tree $G$ satisfies at least one of the following conditions: (a) $G$ is a star, or (b) $G$ has constant maximum degree. Second, we prove that TTR is fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) with respect to the number of leaves in the input tree $G$, via a novel combination of techniques for totally unimodular matrices and mixed integer linear programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extending Dense Passage Retrieval with Temporal Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21024v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal awareness is crucial in many information retrieval tasks, particularly in scenarios where the relevance of documents depends on their alignment with the query's temporal context. Traditional retrieval methods such as BM25 and Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) excel at capturing lexical and semantic relevance but fall short in addressing time-sensitive queries. To bridge this gap, we introduce the temporal retrieval model that integrates explicit temporal signals by incorporating query timestamps and document dates into the representation space. Our approach ensures that retrieved passages are not only topically relevant but also temporally aligned with user intent. We evaluate our approach on two large-scale benchmark datasets, ArchivalQA and ChroniclingAmericaQA, achieving substantial performance gains over standard retrieval baselines. In particular, our model improves Top-1 retrieval accuracy by 6.63% and NDCG@10 by 3.79% on ArchivalQA, while yielding a 9.56% boost in Top-1 retrieval accuracy and 4.68% in NDCG@10 on ChroniclingAmericaQA. Additionally, we introduce a time-sensitive negative sampling strategy, which refines the model's ability to distinguish between temporally relevant and irrelevant documents during training. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly modeling time in retrieval systems and set a new standard for handling temporally grounded queries.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods struggle to manage irrelevant information, such as background noise and redundant semantics, which impacts both efficiency and effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel supervised temporal soft masked autoencoder network for DFER, namely AdaTosk, which integrates a parallel supervised classification branch with the self-supervised reconstruction branch. The self-supervised reconstruction branch applies random binary hard mask to generate diverse training samples, encouraging meaningful feature representations in visible tokens. Meanwhile the classification branch employs an adaptive temporal soft mask to flexibly mask visible tokens based on their temporal significance. Its two key components, respectively of, class-agnostic and class-semantic soft masks, serve to enhance critical expression moments and reduce semantic redundancy over time. Extensive experiments conducted on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our AdaTosk remarkably reduces computational costs compared with current state-of-the-art methods while still maintaining competitive performance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[JiTTER: Jigsaw Temporal Transformer for Event Reconstruction for Self-Supervised Sound Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20857v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sound event detection (SED) has significantly benefited from self-supervised learning (SSL) approaches, particularly masked audio transformer for SED (MAT-SED), which leverages masked block prediction to reconstruct missing audio segments. However, while effective in capturing global dependencies, masked block prediction disrupts transient sound events and lacks explicit enforcement of temporal order, making it less suitable for fine-grained event boundary detection. To address these limitations, we propose JiTTER (Jigsaw Temporal Transformer for Event Reconstruction), an SSL framework designed to enhance temporal modeling in transformer-based SED. JiTTER introduces a hierarchical temporal shuffle reconstruction strategy, where audio sequences are randomly shuffled at both the block-level and frame-level, forcing the model to reconstruct the correct temporal order. This pretraining objective encourages the model to learn both global event structures and fine-grained transient details, improving its ability to detect events with sharp onset-offset characteristics. Additionally, we incorporate noise injection during block shuffle, providing a subtle perturbation mechanism that further regularizes feature learning and enhances model robustness. Experimental results on the DESED dataset demonstrate that JiTTER outperforms MAT-SED, achieving a 5.89% improvement in PSDS, highlighting the effectiveness of explicit temporal reasoning in SSL-based SED. Our findings suggest that structured temporal reconstruction tasks, rather than simple masked prediction, offer a more effective pretraining paradigm for sound event representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Current methods fall into two main categories: single-person-based methods and separate modeling-based methods. To delve into this field, we abstract the overall generation process into a general framework MetaMotion, which consists of two phases: temporal modeling and interaction mixing. For temporal modeling, the single-person-based methods concatenate two people into a single one directly, while the separate modeling-based methods skip the modeling of interaction sequences. The inadequate modeling described above resulted in sub-optimal performance and redundant model parameters. In this paper, we introduce TIMotion (Temporal and Interactive Modeling), an efficient and effective framework for human-human motion generation. Specifically, we first propose Causal Interactive Injection to model two separate sequences as a causal sequence leveraging the temporal and causal properties. Then we present Role-Evolving Scanning to adjust to the change in the active and passive roles throughout the interaction. Finally, to generate smoother and more rational motion, we design Localized Pattern Amplification to capture short-term motion patterns. Extensive experiments on InterHuman and InterX demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance. The project code will be released upon acceptance.

In this study, we propose a Two-Stream Spatial-Temporal Transformer Framework for person identification using upper body keypoints visible during online conversations, which we term conversational keypoints. Our framework processes both spatial relationships between keypoints and their temporal evolution through two specialized branches: a Spatial Transformer (STR) that learns distinctive structural patterns in keypoint configurations, and a Temporal Transformer (TTR) that captures sequential motion patterns. Using the state-of-the-art Sapiens pose estimator, we extract 133 keypoints (based on COCO-WholeBody format) representing facial features, head pose, and hand positions. The framework was evaluated on a dataset of 114 individuals engaged in natural conversations, achieving recognition accuracies of 80.12% for the spatial stream, 63.61% for the temporal stream. We then explored two fusion strategies: a shared loss function approach achieving 82.22% accuracy, and a feature-level fusion method that concatenates feature maps from both streams, significantly improving performance to 94.86%. By jointly modeling both static anatomical relationships and dynamic movement patterns, our approach learns comprehensive identity signatures that are more robust to spoofing than traditional appearance-based methods.</p></details> |  |

This eliminates the need for a synchronisation clock and minimises power consumption when no data is present. However, many benchmarks for neuromorphic algorithms primarily focus on spatial features, neglecting the temporal dynamics that are inherent to most sequence-based tasks. This gap may lead to evaluations that fail to fully capture the unique strengths and characteristics of neuromorphic systems. In this paper, we present NeuroMorse, a temporally structured dataset designed for benchmarking neuromorphic learning systems. NeuroMorse converts the top 50 words in the English language into temporal Morse code spike sequences. Despite using only two input spike channels for Morse dots and dashes, complex information is encoded through temporal patterns in the data. The proposed benchmark contains feature hierarchy at multiple temporal scales that test the capacity of neuromorphic algorithms to decompose input patterns into spatial and temporal hierarchies. We demonstrate that our training set is challenging to categorise using a linear classifier and that identifying keywords in the test set is difficult using conventional methods. The NeuroMorse dataset is available at Zenodo, with our accompanying code on GitHub at https://github.com/Ben-E-Walters/NeuroMorse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: Versatile Missing Data Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data can significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet in practice they are frequently encountered. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any non-systematic missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. We also provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing values, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

Prior efforts have focused on better alignment of image and text representations to enhance image understanding. However, though explicit reference to a prior image is common in Chest X-Ray (CXR) reports, aligning progression descriptions with the semantics differences in image pairs remains under-explored. In this work, we propose two components to address this issue. (1) A CXR report processing pipeline to extract temporal structure. It processes reports with a large language model (LLM) to separate the description and comparison contexts, and extracts fine-grained annotations from reports. (2) A contrastive captioner model for CXR, namely CoCa-CXR, to learn how to both describe images and their temporal progressions. CoCa-CXR incorporates a novel regional cross-attention module to identify local differences between paired CXR images. Extensive experiments show the superiority of CoCa-CXR on both progression analysis and report generation compared to previous methods. Notably, on MS-CXR-T progression classification, CoCa-CXR obtains 65.0% average testing accuracy on five pulmonary conditions, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model BioViL-T by 4.8%. It also achieves a RadGraph F1 of 24.2% on MIMIC-CXR, which is comparable to the Med-Gemini foundation model.</p></details> |  |

Existing datasets, such as TravelPlanner and TravelPlanner+, suffer from semi synthetic data reliance, spatial inconsistencies, and a lack of key travel constraints, making them inadequate for practical itinerary generation. To address these gaps, we introduce TripCraft, a spatiotemporally coherent travel planning dataset that integrates real world constraints, including public transit schedules, event availability, diverse attraction categories, and user personas for enhanced personalization. To evaluate LLM generated plans beyond existing binary validation methods, we propose five continuous evaluation metrics, namely Temporal Meal Score, Temporal Attraction Score, Spatial Score, Ordering Score, and Persona Score which assess itinerary quality across multiple dimensions. Our parameter informed setting significantly enhances meal scheduling, improving the Temporal Meal Score from 61% to 80% in a 7 day scenario. TripCraft establishes a new benchmark for LLM driven personalized travel planning, offering a more realistic, constraint aware framework for itinerary generation. Dataset and Codebase will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 18 Tables and 6 Figures</p></details> |

Although this field has achieved remarkable progress in recent years, further progress and real-world applications are impeded by the absence of a standardized framework. Currently, different methods are compared under different implementation settings, evaluation protocols, etc., making it difficult to assess the real effectiveness of a specific technique. To address this issue, we propose \textbf{OpenTAD}, a unified TAD framework consolidating 16 different TAD methods and 9 standard datasets into a modular codebase. In OpenTAD, minimal effort is required to replace one module with a different design, train a feature-based TAD model in end-to-end mode, or switch between the two. OpenTAD also facilitates straightforward benchmarking across various datasets and enables fair and in-depth comparisons among different methods. With OpenTAD, we comprehensively study how innovations in different network components affect detection performance and identify the most effective design choices through extensive experiments. This study has led to a new state-of-the-art TAD method built upon existing techniques for each component. We have made our code and models available at https://github.com/sming256/OpenTAD.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance often deteriorates under temporal distribution shifts, where trends and periodic patterns are present in the evolving data distribution over time. In this paper, we explore the underlying reasons for this failure in capturing temporal dependencies. We begin by investigating the training protocol, revealing a key issue in how model selection perform. While existing approaches use temporal ordering for splitting validation set, we show that even a random split can significantly improve model performance. By minimizing the time lag between training data and test time, while reducing the bias in validation, our proposed training protocol significantly improves generalization across various methods. Furthermore, we analyze how temporal data affects deep tabular representations, uncovering that these models often fail to capture crucial periodic and trend information. To address this gap, we introduce a plug-and-play temporal embedding method based on Fourier series expansion to learn and incorporate temporal patterns, offering an adaptive approach to handle temporal shifts. Our experiments demonstrate that this temporal embedding, combined with the improved training protocol, provides a more effective and robust framework for learning from temporal tabular data.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Intuitively, these modalities allow to express that, from agent $a$'s standpoint, it is conceivable that a given formula holds. Besides the standard interpretation of the standpoint modalities we introduce four new semantics, which differ in the information an agent can extract from the history. We provide a general model checking algorithm applicable to $SLTL$ under any of the five semantics. Furthermore we analyze the computational complexity of the corresponding model checking problems, obtaining PSPACE-completeness in three cases, which stands in contrast to the known EXPSPACE-completeness of the $SLTL$ satisfiability problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[STUPD: A Synthetic Dataset for Spatial and Temporal Relation Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06680v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding relations between objects is crucial for understanding the semantics of a visual scene. It is also an essential step in order to bridge visual and language models. However, current state-of-the-art computer vision models still lack the ability to perform spatial reasoning well. Existing datasets mostly cover a relatively small number of spatial relations, all of which are static relations that do not intrinsically involve motion. In this paper, we propose the Spatial and Temporal Understanding of Prepositions Dataset (STUPD) -- a large-scale video dataset for understanding static and dynamic spatial relationships derived from prepositions of the English language. The dataset contains 150K visual depictions (videos and images), consisting of 30 distinct spatial prepositional senses, in the form of object interaction simulations generated synthetically using Unity3D. In addition to spatial relations, we also propose 50K visual depictions across 10 temporal relations, consisting of videos depicting event/time-point interactions. To our knowledge, no dataset exists that represents temporal relations through visual settings. In this dataset, we also provide 3D information about object interactions such as frame-wise coordinates, and descriptions of the objects used. The goal of this synthetic dataset is to help models perform better in visual relationship detection in real-world settings. We demonstrate an increase in the performance of various models over 2 real-world datasets (ImageNet-VidVRD and Spatial Senses) when pretrained on the STUPD dataset, in comparison to other pretraining datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, existing technologies are primarily based on visual cues, facing serious challenges in non-light-of-sight and privacy-sensitive in-bed scenes. Pressure-sensing bedsheets offer a promising solution for real-time motion reconstruction. Yet, limited exploration in model designs and data have hindered its further development. To tackle these issues, we propose a general framework that bridges gaps in data annotation and model design. Firstly, we introduce SMPLify-IB, an optimization method that overcomes the depth ambiguity issue in top-view scenarios through gravity constraints, enabling generating high-quality 3D human shape annotations for in-bed datasets. Then we present PI-HMR, a temporal-based human shape estimator to regress meshes from pressure sequences. By integrating multi-scale feature fusion with high-pressure distribution and spatial position priors, PI-HMR outperforms SOTA methods with 17.01mm Mean-Per-Joint-Error decrease.

Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

Stroke predominantly affects older adults, with 75% of cases occurring in individuals aged 65 and older, underscoring the urgent need for tailored rehabilitation strategies in aging populations. Despite the critical role therapists play in evaluating rehabilitation progress and ensuring the effectiveness of treatment, current assessment methods can often be subjective, inconsistent, and time-consuming, leading to delays in adjusting therapy protocols. This study aims to address these challenges by providing a solution for consistent and timely analysis. Specifically, we perform temporal segmentation of video recordings to capture detailed activities during stroke patients' rehabilitation. The main application scenario motivating this study is the clinical assessment of daily tabletop object interactions, which are crucial for post-stroke physical rehabilitation. To achieve this, we present a framework that leverages the biomechanics of movement during therapy sessions. Our solution divides the process into two main tasks: 2D keypoint detection to track patients' physical movements, and 1D time-series temporal segmentation to analyze these movements over time. This dual approach enables automated labeling with only a limited set of real-world data, addressing the challenges of variability in patient movements and limited dataset availability. By tackling these issues, our method shows strong potential for practical deployment in physical therapy settings, enhancing the speed and accuracy of rehabilitation assessments.</p></details> |  |

However, designing an effective 4D backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Also, recent transformer-based 4D backbones commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly for long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel point cloud video understanding backbone purely based on the State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, we first disentangle space and time in 4D video sequences and then establish the spatio-temporal correlation with our designed Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is developed to encode locally similar geometric structures within a certain temporal stride. Subsequently, locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which integrates long-term point features across the entire video with linear complexity. Our proposed Mamba4d achieves competitive performance on the MSR-Action3D action recognition (+10.4% accuracy), HOI4D action segmentation (+0.7 F1 Score), and Synthia4D semantic segmentation (+0.19 mIoU) datasets. Especially, for long video sequences, our method has a significant efficiency improvement with 87.5% GPU memory reduction and 5.36 times speed-up.

Recently, advanced multi-modal methods incorporating camera information have achieved notable performance. For a safe and effective autonomous driving system, algorithms that excel not only in accuracy but also in speed and low latency are essential. However, existing algorithms fail to meet these requirements due to the latency and bandwidth limitations of fixed frame rate sensors, e.g., LiDAR and camera. To address this limitation, we introduce asynchronous event cameras into 3D object detection for the first time. We leverage their high temporal resolution and low bandwidth to enable high-speed 3D object detection. Our method enables detection even during inter-frame intervals when synchronized data is unavailable, by retrieving previous 3D information through the event camera. Furthermore, we introduce the first event-based 3D object detection dataset, DSEC-3DOD, which includes ground-truth 3D bounding boxes at 100 FPS, establishing the first benchmark for event-based 3D detectors. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/mickeykang16/Ev3DOD.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

The objective is to enable the robotic systems to optimally fulfill high-level tasks specified by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. To capture both types of uncertainty in a unified modelling framework, we utilise Markov Decision Processes with Set-valued Transitions (MDPSTs). We introduce a novel solution technique for the optimal robust strategy synthesis of MDPSTs with LTL specifications. To improve efficiency, our work leverages limit-deterministic B\"uchi automata (LDBAs) as the automaton representation for LTL to take advantage of their efficient constructions. To tackle the inherent nondeterminism in MDPSTs, which presents a significant challenge for reducing the LTL planning problem to a reachability problem, we introduce the concept of a Winning Region (WR) for MDPSTs. Additionally, we propose an algorithm for computing the WR over the product of the MDPST and the LDBA. Finally, a robust value iteration algorithm is invoked to solve the reachability problem. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through a case study involving a mobile robot operating in the hexagonal world, demonstrating promising efficiency gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of an accepted ICRA 2025 paper</p></details> |

Resting-state fMRI, a non-invasive tool for capturing brain connectivity patterns, aids in early ASD diagnosis and differentiation from typical controls (TC). However, previous methods, which rely on either mean time series or full 4D data, are limited by a lack of spatial information or by high computational costs. This underscores the need for an efficient solution that preserves both spatial and temporal information. In this paper, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient spatial-temporal-omics learning framework designed to efficiently extract spatio-temporal features from fMRI for ASD classification. Our approach addresses these limitations by utilizing 3D time-domain derivatives as the spatial-temporal inter-voxel omics, which preserve full spatial resolution while capturing diverse statistical characteristics of the time series at each voxel. Meanwhile, functional connectivity features serve as the spatial-temporal inter-regional omics, capturing correlations across brain regions. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on the ABIDE dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms previous methods while maintaining computational efficiency. We believe our research offers valuable insights that will inform and advance future ASD studies, particularly in the realm of spatial-temporal-omics-based learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |

Frequently, such datasets include timestamps and could correspond to, for example, health-related measurements of subjects collected over time. The temporal dimension is inherently different from the other dimensions, requiring methods that account for its intrinsic properties. Linear Dynamical Systems (LDS) are specifically designed to capture sequential dependencies in the observed data. In this work, we bridge the gap between tensor factorizations and dynamical modeling by exploring the relationship between LDS, Coupled Matrix Factorizations (CMF) and the PARAFAC2 model. We propose a time-aware coupled factorization model called d(ynamical)CMF that constrains the temporal evolution of the latent factors to adhere to a specific LDS structure. Using synthetic datasets, we compare the performance of dCMF with PARAFAC2 and t(emporal)PARAFAC2 which incorporates temporal smoothness. Our results show that dCMF and PARAFAC2-based approaches perform similarly when capturing smoothly evolving patterns that adhere to the PARAFAC2 structure. However, dCMF outperforms alternatives when the patterns evolve smoothly but deviate from the PARAFAC2 structure. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed dCMF method enables to capture more complex dynamics when additional prior information about the temporal evolution is incorporated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Nodal Spreading Influence Using Partial Temporal Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19350v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks, whose links are activated or deactivated over time, are used to represent complex systems such as social interactions or collaborations occurring at specific times. Such networks facilitate the spread of information and epidemics. The average number of nodes infected via a spreading process on a network starting from a single seed node over a given period is called the influence of that node. In this paper, we address the question of how to utilize the partially observed temporal network (local and of short duration) around each node, to estimate the ranking of nodes in spreading influence on the full network over a long period. This is essential for target marketing and epidemic/misinformation mitigation where only partial network information is possibly accessible. This would also enable us to understand which network properties of a node, observed locally and shortly after the start of the spreading process, determine its influence. We systematically propose a set of nodal centrality metrics based on partial temporal network information, encoding diverse properties of (time-respecting) walks. It is found that distinct centrality metrics perform the best in estimating nodal influence depending on the infection probability of the spreading process. For a broad range of the infection probability, a node tends to be influential if it can reach many distinct nodes via time-respecting walks and if these nodes can be reached early in time. We find and explain why the proposed metrics generally outperform classic centrality metrics derived from both full and partial temporal networks.</p></details> |  |

The system employs a two-phase generation of a robot-oriented knowledge base, ensuring reusability and compositional reasoning, as well as a three-step planning procedure that handles temporal dependencies, resource constraints, and parallel task execution via mixed-integer linear programming. The final plan is converted into a Behaviour Tree for direct use in ROS2. We tested the framework in multi-robot assembly tasks within a block world and an arch-building scenario. Results demonstrate that LLMs can produce accurate knowledge bases with modest human feedback, while Prolog guarantees formal correctness and explainability. This approach underscores the potential of LLM integration for advanced robotics tasks requiring flexible, scalable, and human-understandable planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latte++: Spatial-Temporal Voxel-based Test-Time Adaptation for Multi-Modal Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06461v4)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal test-time adaptation (MM-TTA) is proposed to adapt models to an unlabeled target domain by leveraging the complementary multi-modal inputs in an online manner. Previous MM-TTA methods for 3D segmentation rely on predictions of cross-modal information in each input frame, while they ignore the fact that predictions of geometric neighborhoods within consecutive frames are highly correlated, leading to unstable predictions across time. To fulfill this gap, we propose ReLiable Spatial-temporal Voxels (Latte), an MM-TTA method that leverages reliable cross-modal spatial-temporal correspondences for multi-modal 3D segmentation. Motivated by the fact that reliable predictions should be consistent with their spatial-temporal correspondences, Latte aggregates consecutive frames in a sliding-window manner and constructs Spatial-Temporal (ST) voxels to capture temporally local prediction consistency for each modality. After filtering out ST voxels with high ST entropy, Latte conducts cross-modal learning for each point and pixel by attending to those with reliable and consistent predictions among both spatial and temporal neighborhoods. Considering the prediction consistency might vary under different sliding windows, we further propose Latte++ which leverages ST voxels generated under various sliding windows to more thoroughly evaluate intra-modal prediction consistency before the cross-modal fusion. Experimental results show that both Latte and Latte++ achieve state-of-the-art performance on five MM-TTA benchmarks compared to previous MM-TTA or TTA methods. Code will be available at https://github.com/AronCao49/Latte-plusplus.</p></details> |  |

Empirical observations suggest that cross-attention outputs converge to a fixed point after several inference steps. The convergence time naturally divides the entire inference process into two phases: an initial phase for planning text-oriented visual semantics, which are then translated into images in a subsequent fidelity-improving phase. Cross-attention is essential in the initial phase but almost irrelevant thereafter. However, self-attention initially plays a minor role but becomes crucial in the second phase. These findings yield a simple and training-free method known as temporally gating the attention (TGATE), which efficiently generates images by caching and reusing attention outputs at scheduled time steps. Experimental results show when widely applied to various existing text-conditional diffusion models, TGATE accelerates these models by 10%-50%.

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional verification approaches often fall short in terms of modularity and composability, which are essential for scalable and maintainable verification. We present a method for modular and compositional verification of concurrent programs using past-time temporal epistemic logic. Our approach builds on Halpern and Moses' epistemic logic framework and incorporates past-time temporal operators to capture the temporal context of thread interactions. We formalize the semantics of our logic, introduce a compositional proof system for reasoning about concurrent programs, and demonstrate its application. The expressiveness of our proposed logic provides a rigorous foundation to verify concurrent systems compositionally.</p></details> |  |

To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges. In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

We observe that metrics such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), based on plant photosynthesis, have unique temporal signatures that reflect agricultural practices and seasonal cycles. We analyze yearly NDVI changes on 20 farms for 10 unique crops. Initial results show that NDVI curves are coherent with agricultural practices, are unique to each crop, consistent globally, and can differentiate farms from forests. We develop a novel longitudinal NDVI dataset for the state of California from 2020-2023 with 500~m resolution and over 70 million points. We use this to develop the TerraTrace platform, an end-to-end analytic tool that classifies land use using NDVI signatures and allows users to query the system through an LLM chatbot and graphical interface.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Existing interpretation methods are limited by focusing mostly on classification tasks, evaluating using custom baseline models instead of the latest time series models, using simple synthetic datasets, and requiring training another model. We introduce a novel interpretation method, \textit{Windowed Temporal Saliency Rescaling (WinTSR)} addressing these limitations. WinTSR explicitly captures temporal dependencies among the past time steps and efficiently scales the feature importance with this time importance. We benchmark WinTSR against 10 recent interpretation techniques with 5 state-of-the-art deep-learning models of different architectures, including a time series foundation model. We use 3 real-world datasets for both time-series classification and regression. Our comprehensive analysis shows that WinTSR significantly outperforms other local interpretation methods in overall performance. Finally, we provide a novel, open-source framework to interpret the latest time series transformers and foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 14 figures, GitHub https://github.com/khairulislam/Timeseries-Explained</p></details> |

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against 11 baselines.</p></details> |  |

The objective is to provide a quality score to ensure correct performance and achieve desired results. To achieve this goal, a new graph-based model, the Dense Spatio-Temporal Graph Conv-GRU Network with Transformer, is introduced. This model combines a modified version of STGCN and transformer architectures for efficient handling of spatio-temporal data. The key idea is to consider skeleton data respecting its non-linear structure as a graph and detecting joints playing the main role in each rehabilitation exercise. Dense connections and GRU mechanisms are used to rapidly process large 3D skeleton inputs and effectively model temporal dynamics. The transformer encoder's attention mechanism focuses on relevant parts of the input sequence, making it useful for evaluating rehabilitation exercises. The evaluation of our proposed approach on the KIMORE and UI-PRMD datasets highlighted its potential, surpassing state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and computational time. This resulted in faster and more accurate learning and assessment of rehabilitation exercises. Additionally, our model provides valuable feedback through qualitative illustrations, effectively highlighting the significance of joints in specific exercises.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Computers in Biology and Medicine Journal</p></details> |

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model. We evaluate our model on the UI-PRMD dataset demonstrating its performance in accurately predicting real-time patient action scores, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recurrent Neural Networks for Dynamic VWAP Execution: Adaptive Trading Strategies with Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18177v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The execution of Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) orders remains a critical challenge in modern financial markets, particularly as trading volumes and market complexity continue to increase. In my previous work arXiv:2502.13722, I introduced a novel deep learning approach that demonstrated significant improvements over traditional VWAP execution methods by directly optimizing the execution problem rather than relying on volume curve predictions. However, that model was static because it employed the fully linear approach described in arXiv:2410.21448, which is not designed for dynamic adjustment. This paper extends that foundation by developing a dynamic neural VWAP framework that adapts to evolving market conditions in real time. We introduce two key innovations: first, the integration of recurrent neural networks to capture complex temporal dependencies in market dynamics, and second, a sophisticated dynamic adjustment mechanism that continuously optimizes execution decisions based on market feedback. The empirical analysis, conducted across five major cryptocurrency markets, demonstrates that this dynamic approach achieves substantial improvements over both traditional methods and our previous static implementation, with execution performance gains of 10 to 15% in liquid markets and consistent outperformance across varying conditions. These results suggest that adaptive neural architectures can effectively address the challenges of modern VWAP execution while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for practical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracking Control of Euler-Lagrangian Systems with Prescribed State, Input, and Temporal Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01866v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The synthesis of a smooth tracking control policy for Euler-Lagrangian (EL) systems with stringent regions of operation induced by state, input and temporal (SIT) constraints is a very challenging task. Most existing solutions rely on prior information of the parameters of the nominal EL dynamics together with bounds on system uncertainty, and incorporate either state or input constraints to guarantee tracking error convergence in a prescribed settling time. Contrary to these approaches, this study proposes an approximation-free adaptive barrier function-based control policy for achieving local prescribed-time convergence of the tracking error to a prescribed-bound in the presence of state and input constraints. This is achieved by imposing time-varying bounds on the filtered tracking error to confine the states within their respective bounds, while also incorporating a saturation function to limit the magnitude of the proposed control action that leverages smooth time-based generator functions for ensuring tracking error convergence within the prescribed-time. Importantly, corresponding feasibility conditions pertaining to the minimum control authority, maximum disturbance rejection capability of the control policy, and the viable set of initial conditions are derived, illuminating the narrow operating domain of the EL systems arising from the interplay of SIT constraints. Numerical validation studies with three different robotic manipulators are employed to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed scheme. A detailed performance comparison study with leading alternative designs is also undertaken to illustrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

| **[GaussianFlowOcc: Sparse and Weakly Supervised Occupancy Estimation using Gaussian Splatting and Temporal Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17288v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Occupancy estimation has become a prominent task in 3D computer vision, particularly within the autonomous driving community. In this paper, we present a novel approach to occupancy estimation, termed GaussianFlowOcc, which is inspired by Gaussian Splatting and replaces traditional dense voxel grids with a sparse 3D Gaussian representation. Our efficient model architecture based on a Gaussian Transformer significantly reduces computational and memory requirements by eliminating the need for expensive 3D convolutions used with inefficient voxel-based representations that predominantly represent empty 3D spaces. GaussianFlowOcc effectively captures scene dynamics by estimating temporal flow for each Gaussian during the overall network training process, offering a straightforward solution to a complex problem that is often neglected by existing methods. Moreover, GaussianFlowOcc is designed for scalability, as it employs weak supervision and does not require costly dense 3D voxel annotations based on additional data (e.g., LiDAR). Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that GaussianFlowOcc significantly outperforms all previous methods for weakly supervised occupancy estimation on the nuScenes dataset while featuring an inference speed that is 50 times faster than current SOTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Can Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v4)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, reinforcement learning (RL) agents learn to solve new tasks by updating their neural network parameters through interactions with the task environment. However, recent works demonstrate that some RL agents, after certain pretraining procedures, can learn to solve unseen new tasks without parameter updates, a phenomenon known as in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL). The empirical success of ICRL is widely attributed to the hypothesis that the forward pass of the pretrained agent neural network implements an RL algorithm. In this paper, we support this hypothesis by showing, both empirically and theoretically, that when a transformer is trained for policy evaluation tasks, it can discover and learn to implement temporal difference learning in its forward pass.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the efficacy of zero-shot LLMs in summarizing long clinical texts that require temporal reasoning, a critical aspect for comprehensively capturing patient histories and treatment trajectories. We applied a series of advanced zero-shot LLMs to extensive clinical documents, assessing their ability to integrate and accurately reflect temporal dynamics without prior task-specific training. While the models efficiently identified key temporal events, they struggled with chronological coherence over prolonged narratives. The evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative methods, highlights the strengths and limitations of zero-shot LLMs in clinical text summarization. The results suggest that while promising, zero-shot LLMs require further refinement to effectively support clinical decision-making processes, underscoring the need for enhanced model training approaches that better capture the nuances of temporal information in long context medical documents.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the task of learning from abbreviated user interaction sequences poses a notable challenge. Data augmentation has been identified as a potent strategy to enhance the informational richness of these sequences. Traditional augmentation techniques, such as item randomization, may disrupt the inherent temporal dynamics. Although recent advancements in reverse chronological pseudo-item generation have shown promise, they can introduce temporal discrepancies when assessed in a natural chronological context. In response, we introduce a sophisticated approach, Bidirectional temporal data Augmentation with pre-training (BARec). Our approach leverages bidirectional temporal augmentation and knowledge-enhanced fine-tuning to synthesize authentic pseudo-prior items that retain user preferences and capture deeper item semantic correlations, thus boosting the model's expressive power. Our comprehensive experimental analysis on five benchmark datasets confirms the superiority of BARec across both short and elongated sequence contexts. Moreover, theoretical examination and case study offer further insight into the model's logical processes and interpretability.

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

To facilitate this line of research, in this work, we propose a new benchmark, termed $\textbf{P}$ath $\textbf{P}$lanning from $\textbf{N}$atural $\textbf{L}$anguage ($\textbf{PPNL}$). Our benchmark evaluates LLMs' spatial-temporal reasoning by formulating ''path planning'' tasks that require an LLM to navigate to target locations while avoiding obstacles and adhering to constraints. Leveraging this benchmark, we systematically investigate LLMs including GPT-4 via different few-shot prompting methodologies as well as BART and T5 of various sizes via fine-tuning. Our experimental results show the promise of few-shot GPT-4 in spatial reasoning, when it is prompted to reason and act interleavedly, although it still fails to perform long-term temporal reasoning. In contrast, while fine-tuned LLMs achieved impressive results on in-distribution reasoning tasks, they struggled to generalize to larger environments or environments with more obstacles.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

Spectral-temporal graph neural network is a promising abstraction underlying most time series forecasting models that are based on graph neural networks (GNNs). However, more is needed to know about the underpinnings of this branch of methods. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework that unravels the expressive power of spectral-temporal GNNs. Our results show that linear spectral-temporal GNNs are universal under mild assumptions, and their expressive power is bounded by our extended first-order Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm on discrete-time dynamic graphs. To make our findings useful in practice on valid instantiations, we discuss related constraints in detail and outline a theoretical blueprint for designing spatial and temporal modules in spectral domains. Building on these insights and to demonstrate how powerful spectral-temporal GNNs are based on our framework, we propose a simple instantiation named Temporal Graph Gegenbauer Convolution (TGGC), which significantly outperforms most existing models with only linear components and shows better model efficiency. Our findings pave the way for devising a broader array of provably expressive GNN-based models for time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |

In order to simultaneously visualize more objects, in this paper, we propose to use video-to-video translation that mimics the development process of microscopic objects. In essence, we use a microscopy video-to-video translation framework namely Spatial-temporal Generative Adversarial Network (STGAN) to reveal the spatial and temporal relationships between the microscopic objects, after which a microscopy video of one object can be translated to another object in a different domain. The experimental results confirm that the proposed STGAN is effective in microscopy video-to-video translation that mitigates the spectral conflicts caused by the limited fluorescent labels, allowing multiple microscopic objects be simultaneously visualized.</p></details> |  |

These scenarios, despite realistic, are often neglected in the literature, exposing these solutions to important performance degradation. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing, for the first time, an approach for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in sparse TAL, which we refer to as Semantic Adversarial unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SADA). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we pioneer the development of a domain adaptation model that operates on realistic sparse action detection benchmarks; (2) we tackle the limitations of global-distribution alignment techniques by introducing a novel adversarial loss that is sensitive to local class distributions, ensuring finer-grained adaptation; and (3) we present a novel set of benchmarks based on EpicKitchens100 and CharadesEgo, that evaluate multiple domain shifts in a comprehensive manner. Our experiments indicate that SADA improves the adaptation across domains when compared to fully supervised state-of-the-art and alternative UDA methods, attaining a performance boost of up to 6.14% mAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in dynamic environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, research paper</p></details> |

Although many methods have been explored, they assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/githubhyz/DeLTa</p></details> |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

| **[Quantifying Point Contributions: A Lightweight Framework for Efficient and Effective Query-Driven Trajectory Simplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02047v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large volumes of trajectory data accumulate, simplifying trajectories to reduce storage and querying costs is increasingly studied. Existing proposals face three main problems. First, they require numerous iterations to decide which GPS points to delete. Second, they focus only on the relationships between neighboring points (local information) while neglecting the overall structure (global information), reducing the global similarity between the simplified and original trajectories and making it difficult to maintain consistency in query results, especially for similarity-based queries. Finally, they fail to differentiate the importance of points with similar features, leading to suboptimal selection of points to retain the original trajectory information. We propose MLSimp, a novel Mutual Learning query-driven trajectory simplification framework that integrates two distinct models: GNN-TS, based on graph neural networks, and Diff-TS, based on diffusion models. GNN-TS evaluates the importance of a point according to its globality, capturing its correlation with the entire trajectory, and its uniqueness, capturing its differences from neighboring points. It also incorporates attention mechanisms in the GNN layers, enabling simultaneous data integration from all points within the same trajectory and refining representations, thus avoiding iterative processes. Diff-TS generates amplified signals to enable the retention of the most important points at low compression rates. Experiments involving eight baselines on three databases show that MLSimp reduces the simplification time by 42%--70% and improves query accuracy over simplified trajectories by up to 34.6%.</p></details> | Accepted by VLDB2025 |
| **[Density estimation with LLMs: a geometric investigation of in-context learning trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05218v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable emergent abilities to perform in-context learning across various tasks, including time series forecasting. This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs. Our codebase, along with a 3D visualization of an LLM's in-context learning trajectory, is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/LLMICL_inPCA</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a new task goal identification from observed UI trajectories aiming to infer the user's detailed intentions when performing a task within UI environments. To support this task, we also introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to assess whether two intent descriptions can be considered paraphrases within a specific UI environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this task can leverage datasets designed for the inverse problem of UI automation, utilizing Android and web datasets for our experiments. To benchmark this task, we compare the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro, using our proposed metric. The results reveal that both Gemini and GPT underperform relative to human performance, underscoring the challenge of the proposed task and the significant room for improvement. This work highlights the importance of goal identification within UI trajectories, providing a foundation for further exploration and advancement in this area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Class-Aware Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01440v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of multi-agent reinforcement learning, generalization is a challenge to solve various tasks that may require different joint policies or coordination without relying on policies specialized for each task. We refer to this type of problem as a multi-task, and we train agents to be versatile in this multi-task setting through a single training process. To address this challenge, we introduce TRajectory-class-Aware Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (TRAMA). In TRAMA, agents recognize a task type by identifying the class of trajectories they are experiencing through partial observations, and the agents use this trajectory awareness or prediction as additional information for action policy. To this end, we introduce three primary objectives in TRAMA: (a) constructing a quantized latent space to generate trajectory embeddings that reflect key similarities among them; (b) conducting trajectory clustering using these trajectory embeddings; and (c) building a trajectory-class-aware policy. Specifically for (c), we introduce a trajectory-class predictor that performs agent-wise predictions on the trajectory class; and we design a trajectory-class representation model for each trajectory class. Each agent takes actions based on this trajectory-class representation along with its partial observation for task-aware execution. The proposed method is evaluated on various tasks, including multi-task problems built upon StarCraft II. Empirical results show further performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDTS: Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14922v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lt-Di-0E51.</p></details> |  |

The proposed algorithm ensures obstacle avoidance for the entire system, including the quadrotors, cables, and the payload in all six degrees of freedom (DoF). We introduce the use of CBFs to enable safe and smooth maneuvers, effectively navigating through cluttered environments while accommodating the system's nonlinear dynamics. To simplify complex constraints, the system components are modeled as convex polytopes, and the Duality theorem is employed to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem. We validate the performance of our planning approach both in simulation and real-world environments using multiple quadrotors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving obstacle avoidance and safe trajectory generation for cooperative transportation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation(ICRA), 2025.

This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

Our proposal generalizes prior work by allowing the reference process in the Schr\"odinger Bridge problem to be a smooth Gaussian process, leading to more regular and interpretable trajectories in applications.

In this paper, we present a solution for this problem using a novel drag-aware model formulation which is coupled with MPC, and therefore, enables tracking and landing during high-speed curvilinear trajectories of an USV without any communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach yields 40% decrease in prediction errors, and provides a 3-fold increase in certainty of predictions. Consequently, this leads to a 30% improvement in tracking performance and 40% higher success in landing on a moving USV even during aggressive turns that are unfeasible for conventional marine missions. We test our approach in two different real-world scenarios with marine vessels of two different sizes and further solidify our results through statistical analysis in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels.

Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing.

However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times.

| **[Minds on the Move: Decoding Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving with Cognitive Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20084v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer vehicle (robot) consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatio-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collision-free regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves several-fold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,11 figures, references added</p></details> |
| **[3D Trajectory Reconstruction of Moving Points Based on a Monocular Camera](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19689v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The motion measurement of point targets constitutes a fundamental problem in photogrammetry, with extensive applications across various engineering domains. Reconstructing a point's 3D motion just from the images captured by only a monocular camera is unfeasible without prior assumptions. Under limited observation conditions such as insufficient observations, long distance, and high observation error of platform, the least squares estimation faces the issue of ill-conditioning. This paper presents an algorithm for reconstructing 3D trajectories of moving points using a monocular camera. The motion of the points is represented through temporal polynomials. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the issues of ill-conditioning caused by limited observation conditions. Then, an automatic algorithm for determining the order of the temporal polynomials is proposed. Furthermore, the definition of reconstructability for temporal polynomials is proposed to describe the reconstruction accuracy quantitatively. The simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sports-Traj: A Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent Movement in Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17680v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multi-agent movement is critical across various fields. The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports.

| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Due to the potentially long distance of the UAV's flight, frequent handovers may be incurred among different GBSs, which leads to various practical issues such as large delay and synchronization overhead. To address this problem, we investigate the trajectory optimization of the UAV to minimize the number of GBS handovers during the flight, subject to a communication quality constraint and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive useful structures of the optimal solution, based on which we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory design.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |

Unlike competing-event models, the events here are not mutually exclusive and often exhibit statistical dependencies. Existing approaches for multi-event survival analysis have generally been limited, most focusing on producing simple risk scores for each event, rather than the time-to-event itself. To overcome these issues, we introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning approach for multi-event survival analysis. MENSA jointly learns representations of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structure among events. In practice, it attempts to optimize the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show that MENSA consistently gives good discrimination performances and accurate time-to-event predictions in single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event problems. Additionally, MENSA is more computationally-efficient, requiring fewer parameters and FLOPs than multiple state-of-the-art survival baselines when applied to large-dimensional datasets (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Instruction Following Policies via Trajectory Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01871v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scalability of instructable agents in robotics or gaming is often hindered by limited data that pairs instructions with agent trajectories. However, large datasets of unannotated trajectories containing sequences of various agent behaviour (play trajectories) are often available. In a semi-supervised setup, we explore methods to extract labelled segments from play trajectories. The goal is to augment a small annotated dataset of instruction-trajectory pairs to improve the performance of an instruction-following policy trained downstream via imitation learning. Assuming little variation in segment length, recent video segmentation methods can effectively extract labelled segments. To address the constraint of segment length, we propose Play Segmentation (PS), a probabilistic model that finds maximum likely segmentations of extended subsegments, while only being trained on individual instruction segments. Our results in a game environment and a simulated robotic gripper setting underscore the importance of segmentation; randomly sampled segments diminish performance, while incorporating labelled segments from PS improves policy performance to the level of a policy trained on twice the amount of labelled data.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[Patient Trajectory Prediction: Integrating Clinical Notes with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18009v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting disease trajectories from electronic health records (EHRs) is a complex task due to major challenges such as data non-stationarity, high granularity of medical codes, and integration of multimodal data. EHRs contain both structured data, such as diagnostic codes, and unstructured data, such as clinical notes, which hold essential information often overlooked. Current models, primarily based on structured data, struggle to capture the complete medical context of patients, resulting in a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates unstructured clinical notes into transformer-based deep learning models for sequential disease prediction. This integration enriches the representation of patients' medical histories, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis predictions. Experiments on MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional models relying solely on structured data.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate inertial drift, end-to-end neural network approaches combined with quadrotor periodic trajectories were suggested. There, the quadrotor distance is regressed and combined with inertial model-based heading estimation, the quadrotor position vector is estimated. To further enhance positioning performance, in this paper we propose a quadrotor neural dead reckoning approach for quadrotors flying on periodic trajectories. In this case, the inertial readings are fed into a simple and efficient network to directly estimate the quadrotor position vector. Our approach was evaluated on two different quadrotors, one operating indoors while the other outdoors. Our approach improves the positioning accuracy of other deep-learning approaches, achieving an average 27% reduction in error outdoors and an average 79% reduction indoors, while requiring only software modifications. With the improved positioning accuracy achieved by our method, the quadrotor can seamlessly perform its tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Structured versus Unstructured Environments based on Pedestrians' and Vehicles' Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16847v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</p></details> |  |

However, existing datasets often suffer from limited scale diversity and inaccurate annotations, hindering robust model development. This paper introduces UAVDB, a high-resolution UAV detection dataset constructed using Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC). This novel technique automatically generates high-fidelity bounding box annotations from UAV trajectory data~\cite{li2020reconstruction}, eliminating the need for manual labeling. UAVDB features single-class annotations with a fixed-camera setup and consists of RGB frames capturing UAVs across various scales, from large-scale UAVs to near-single-pixel representations, along with challenging backgrounds that pose difficulties for modern detectors. We first validate the accuracy and efficiency of PIC-generated bounding boxes by comparing Intersection over Union (IoU) performance and runtime against alternative annotation methods, demonstrating that PIC achieves higher annotation accuracy while being more efficient. Subsequently, we benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors, establishing UAVDB as a valuable resource for advancing long-range and high-resolution UAV detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part II of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing PPO with Trajectory-Aware Hybrid Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15968v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular state-of-the-art on-policy algorithms that has become a standard baseline in modern reinforcement learning with applications in numerous fields. Though it delivers stable performance with theoretical policy improvement guarantees, high variance, and high sample complexity still remain critical challenges in on-policy algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hybrid-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization (HP3O), which utilizes a trajectory replay buffer to make efficient use of trajectories generated by recent policies. Particularly, the buffer applies the "first in, first out" (FIFO) strategy so as to keep only the recent trajectories to attenuate the data distribution drift. A batch consisting of the trajectory with the best return and other randomly sampled ones from the buffer is used for updating the policy networks. The strategy helps the agent to improve its capability on top of the most recent best performance and in turn reduce variance empirically. We theoretically construct the policy improvement guarantees for the proposed algorithm. HP3O is validated and compared against several baseline algorithms using multiple continuous control environments. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |

It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).</p></details> |  |
| **[A View of the Certainty-Equivalence Method for PAC RL as an Application of the Trajectory Tree Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}. A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, excluding references and appendices.

| **[Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 16 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables.

| **[From Text to Trajectory: Exploring Complex Constraint Representation and Decomposition in Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08920v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Real-Time Moving Flock Detection in Pedestrian Trajectories Using Sequential Deep Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15252v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding collective pedestrian movement is crucial for applications in crowd management, autonomous navigation, and human-robot interaction. This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Finding Complex Patterns in Trajectory Data via Geometric Set Cover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14865v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering trajectories is a central challenge when faced with large amounts of movement data such as GPS data. We study a clustering problem that can be stated as a geometric set cover problem: Given a polygonal curve of complexity $n$, find the smallest number $k$ of representative trajectories of complexity at most $l$ such that any point on the input trajectories lies on a subtrajectory of the input that has Fr\'echet distance at most $\Delta$ to one of the representative trajectories. In previous work, Br\"uning et al.~(2022) developed a bicriteria approximation algorithm that returns a set of curves of size $O(kl\log(kl))$ which covers the input with a radius of $11\Delta$ in time $\widetilde{O}((kl)^2n + kln^3)$, where $k$ is the smallest number of curves of complexity $l$ needed to cover the input with a radius of $\Delta$. The representative trajectories computed by this algorithm are always line segments. In the applications however, one is usually interested in more complex representative curves which consist of several edges. We present a new approach that builds upon previous work computing a set of curves of size $O(k\log(n))$ in time $\widetilde{O}(l^2n^4 + kln^4)$ with the same distance guarantee of $11\Delta$, where each curve may consist of curves of complexity up to the given complexity parameter~$l$. We conduct experiments on tracking data of ocean currents and full body motion data suggesting its validity as a tool for analyzing large spatio-temporal data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[MPPI-DBaS: Safe Trajectory Optimization with Adaptive Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14387v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In trajectory optimization, Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control is a sampling-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework that generates optimal inputs by efficiently simulating numerous trajectories. In practice, however, MPPI often struggles to guarantee safety assurance and balance efficient sampling in open spaces with the need for more extensive exploration under tight constraints. To address this challenge, we incorporate discrete barrier states (DBaS) into MPPI and propose a novel MPPI-DBaS algorithm that ensures system safety and enables adaptive exploration across diverse scenarios. We evaluate our method in simulation experiments where the vehicle navigates through closely placed obstacles. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard MPPI, achieving a higher success rate and lower tracking errors.</p></details> | CCC 2025 |
| **[STeCa: Step-level Trajectory Calibration for LLM Agent Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14276v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in tackling complex tasks by interacting dynamically with the environment. Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations and preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle in long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that step-level calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

| **[An Online Optimization-Based Trajectory Planning Approach for Cooperative Landing Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13823v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a real-time trajectory planning scheme for a heterogeneous multi-robot system (consisting of a quadrotor and a ground mobile robot) for a cooperative landing task, where the landing position, landing time, and coordination between the robots are determined autonomously under the consideration of feasibility and user specifications. The proposed framework leverages the potential of the complementarity constraint as a decision-maker and an indicator for diverse cooperative tasks and extends it to the collaborative landing scenario. In a potential application of the proposed methodology, a ground mobile robot may serve as a mobile charging station and coordinates in real-time with a quadrotor to be charged, facilitating a safe and efficient rendezvous and landing. We verified the generated trajectories in simulation and real-world applications, demonstrating the real-time capabilities of the proposed landing planning framework.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explorer: Scaling Exploration-driven Web Trajectory Synthesis for Multimodal Web Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11357v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success in large multimodal models (LMMs) has sparked promising applications of agents capable of autonomously completing complex web tasks. While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[BoundPlanner: A convex-set-based approach to bounded manipulator trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13286v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory planning enables robot manipulators to react quickly to changing environments or tasks. Many robot trajectory planners exist for known environments but are often too slow for online computations. Current methods in online trajectory planning do not find suitable trajectories in challenging scenarios that respect the limits of the robot and account for collisions. This work proposes a trajectory planning framework consisting of the novel Cartesian path planner based on convex sets, called BoundPlanner, and the online trajectory planner BoundMPC. BoundPlanner explores and maps the collision-free space using convex sets to compute a reference path with bounds. BoundMPC is extended in this work to handle convex sets for path deviations, which allows the robot to optimally follow the path within the bounds while accounting for the robot's kinematics. Collisions of the robot's kinematic chain are considered by a novel convex-set-based collision avoidance formulation independent on the number of obstacles. Simulations and experiments with a 7-DoF manipulator show the performance of the proposed planner compared to state-of-the-art methods. The source code is available at github.com/Thieso/BoundPlanner and videos of the experiments can be found at www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d4</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Our vehicle simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.

| **[Learning Plasma Dynamics and Robust Rampdown Trajectories with Predict-First Experiments at TCV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12327v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rampdown in tokamak operations is a difficult to simulate phase during which the plasma is often pushed towards multiple instability limits. To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.</p></details> |  |

Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

| **[Leader and Follower: Interactive Motion Generation under Trajectory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11563v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of game and film production, generating interactive motion from texts has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize content creation processes. In many practical applications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range or trajectory of virtual characters. However, existing methods that rely solely on textual input face substantial challenges in accurately capturing the user's intent, particularly in specifying the desired trajectory. As a result, the generated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy. Moreover, existing trajectory - based methods for customized motion generation rely on retraining for single - actor scenarios, which limits flexibility and adaptability to different datasets, as well as interactivity in two-actor motions. To generate interactive motion following specified trajectories, this paper decouples complex motion into a Leader - Follower dynamic, inspired by role allocation in partner dancing. Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range refinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a training-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic Synchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models to generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's movement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging trajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A linear-time algorithm computing the resident fitness in interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a certain population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness (at all times) can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm is given in terms of the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we show that even the expected number of slope changes grows only linearly in time.</p></details> |  |

However, accurate position data of a target mobile device, typically obtained from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), cellular networks, or WiFi, may not always be accessible to first responders. For instance, 1) accuracy and availability can be limited in challenging signal reception environments, and 2) in regions where emergency location services are not mandatory, certain mobile devices may not transmit their location during emergencies. As an alternative localization method, a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to passively locate targets by collecting radio frequency (RF) signal measurements, such as received signal strength (RSS). In these situations, UAV trajectories play a critical role in localization performance, influencing both accuracy and search time. Previous studies optimized UAV trajectories using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), but its performance declines under unfavorable geometric conditions, such as when UAVs start from a single base, leading to position ambiguity. To address this, our prior work introduced a rigidity-based approach, which improved the search time compared to FIM-based methods in our simulation case. However, the high computational cost of rigidity-based optimization, primarily due to singular value decomposition (SVD), limits its practicality. In this paper, we applied techniques to reduce computational complexity, including randomized SVD, smooth SVD, and vertex pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ION ITM 2025</p></details> |

Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

Our analysis demonstrates that poor quality input leads to noisy and unreliable predictions, which can be detrimental to navigation modules. We evaluate both input data quality and model output to illustrate the impact of input noise. Furthermore, we show that our estimation system enables effective training of trajectory prediction models even with limited data, producing robust predictions across different environments. Accurate estimations are crucial for deploying trajectory prediction models in real-world scenarios, and our system ensures meaningful and reliable results across various application contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV 2025)</p></details> |

However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. In real-world driving, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical trajectory, but also by the behavior of other vehicles. So, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between vehicles. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose an endpoint prediction module for the target vehicle. This module predicts the target vehicle endpoints, refines them using a correction mechanism, and generates a multimodal predicted trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset. The code will be open sourced after the letter is accepted.</p></details> |  |

One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Vulnerabilities of GPS Trip Data to Trajectory-User Linking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08217v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open human mobility data is considered an essential basis for the profound research and analysis required for the transition to sustainable mobility and sustainable urban planning. Cycling data has especially been the focus of data collection endeavors in recent years. Although privacy risks regarding location data are widely known, practitioners often refrain from advanced privacy mechanisms to prevent utility losses. Removing user identifiers from trips is thereby deemed a major privacy gain, as it supposedly prevents linking single trips to obtain entire movement patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel attack to reconstruct user identifiers in GPS trip datasets consisting of single trips, unlike previous ones that are dedicated to evaluating trajectory-user linking in the context of check-in data. We evaluate the remaining privacy risk for users in such datasets and our empirical findings from two real-world datasets show that the risk of re-identification is significant even when personal identifiers have been removed, and that truncation as a simple additional privacy mechanism may not be effective in protecting user privacy. Further investigations indicate that users who frequently visit locations that are only visited by a small number of others, tend to be more vulnerable to re-identification.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures |
| **[RouteFlow: Trajectory-Aware Animated Transitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08076v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Animating objects' movements is widely used to facilitate tracking changes and observing both the global trend and local hotspots where objects converge or diverge. Existing methods, however, often obscure critical local hotspots by only considering the start and end positions of objects' trajectories. To address this gap, we propose RouteFlow, a trajectory-aware animated transition method that effectively balances the global trend and local hotspots while minimizing occlusion. RouteFlow is inspired by a real-world bus route analogy: objects are regarded as passengers traveling together, with local hotspots representing bus stops where these passengers get on and off. Based on this analogy, animation paths are generated like bus routes, with the object layout generated similarly to seat allocation according to their destinations. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, RouteFlow better facilitates identifying the global trend and locating local hotspots while performing comparably in tracking objects' movements.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the high-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations among multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence patterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest (POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on different trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by disparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory User Linking model (HGTUL). Our model learns trajectory representations from both relational and spatio-temporal perspectives: (1) it captures high-order associations among trajectories by constructing a trajectory hypergraph and leverages a hypergraph attention network to learn the variable impact of POIs on trajectories; (2) it models the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories by incorporating their temporal and spatial information into a sequential encoder. Moreover, we design a data balancing method to effectively address the user class imbalance problem and experimentally validate its significance in TUL. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGTUL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 2.57%~20.09% and 5.68%~26.00% in ACC@1 and Macro-F1 metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PLMTrajRec: A Scalable and Generalizable Trajectory Recovery Method with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is crucial for various applications. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07178v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -- the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep -- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

Numerical models, such as MEDSLIK-II, simulate advection, dispersion, and transformation processes of oil particles. However, simulations heavily rely on accurate parameter tuning, still based on expert knowledge and manual calibration. To overcome these limitations, we integrate the MEDSLIK-II numerical oil spill model with a Bayesian optimization framework to iteratively estimate the best physical parameter configuration that yields simulation closer to satellite observations of the slick. We focus on key parameters, such as horizontal diffusivity and drift factor, maximizing the Fraction Skill Score (FSS) as a measure of spatio-temporal overlap between simulated and observed oil distributions. We validate the framework for the Baniyas oil incident that occurred in Syria between August 23 and September 4, 2021, which released over 12,000 $m^3$ of oil. We show that, on average, the proposed approach systematically improves the FSS from 5.82% to 11.07% compared to control simulations initialized with default parameters. The optimization results in consistent improvement across multiple time steps, particularly during periods of increased drift variability, demonstrating the robustness of our method in dynamic environmental conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 10 figures, 3 tables, research paper</p></details> |

Although many methods have been explored, they assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and replaces the attention scores in Transformer with a newly computed physical correlation coefficient, enhancing the interpretability of interaction modeling. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

However, concerns about the reliability of the content they generate persist, as it frequently deviates from factual correctness or exhibits deficiencies in logical reasoning. This paper proposes a novel decoding strategy aimed at enhancing both factual accuracy and inferential reasoning without requiring any modifications to the architecture or pre-trained parameters of LLMs. Our approach adjusts next-token probabilities by analyzing the trajectory of logits from lower to higher layers in Transformers and applying linear regression. We find that this Decoding by Logit Trajectory-based approach (DeLTa) effectively reinforces factuality and reasoning while mitigating incorrect generation. Experiments on TruthfulQA demonstrate that DeLTa attains up to a 4.9% improvement over the baseline. Furthermore, it enhances performance by up to 8.1% on StrategyQA and 7.3% on GSM8K, both of which demand strong reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/githubhyz/DeLTa</p></details> |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

| **[Quantifying Point Contributions: A Lightweight Framework for Efficient and Effective Query-Driven Trajectory Simplification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02047v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large volumes of trajectory data accumulate, simplifying trajectories to reduce storage and querying costs is increasingly studied. Existing proposals face three main problems. First, they require numerous iterations to decide which GPS points to delete. Second, they focus only on the relationships between neighboring points (local information) while neglecting the overall structure (global information), reducing the global similarity between the simplified and original trajectories and making it difficult to maintain consistency in query results, especially for similarity-based queries. Finally, they fail to differentiate the importance of points with similar features, leading to suboptimal selection of points to retain the original trajectory information. We propose MLSimp, a novel Mutual Learning query-driven trajectory simplification framework that integrates two distinct models: GNN-TS, based on graph neural networks, and Diff-TS, based on diffusion models. GNN-TS evaluates the importance of a point according to its globality, capturing its correlation with the entire trajectory, and its uniqueness, capturing its differences from neighboring points. It also incorporates attention mechanisms in the GNN layers, enabling simultaneous data integration from all points within the same trajectory and refining representations, thus avoiding iterative processes. Diff-TS generates amplified signals to enable the retention of the most important points at low compression rates. Experiments involving eight baselines on three databases show that MLSimp reduces the simplification time by 42%--70% and improves query accuracy over simplified trajectories by up to 34.6%.</p></details> | Accepted by VLDB2025 |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs. Our codebase, along with a 3D visualization of an LLM's in-context learning trajectory, is publicly available at https://github.com/AntonioLiu97/LLMICL_inPCA</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches rely on expensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. We propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates web agent trajectories by leveraging publicly available tutorials. Our three-stage method: (1) automatically harvests and filters tutorial-like texts from the internet using a specialized classification model, (2) transforms these texts into structured task specifications with step-by-step instructions, and (3) employs a visual-language model (VLM) agent to execute these instructions in real environments, while a VLM-based evaluator verifies trajectory correctness. The synthesized trajectories encompass multiple modalities, including text-based HTML observations with function-calling API actions, and vision-based screenshot observations with pixel-level actions. This multimodal data, enriched with chain-of-thought reasoning, enables agents to achieve state-of-the-art performance on both textual web browsing benchmarks (e.g., WebArena) and visual web grounding and browsing benchmarks (e.g., ScreenSpot Web and Multimodal Mind2Web). Furthermore, our fully automated approach significantly reduces data collection costs, achieving a cost of just $0.55 per high-quality trajectory without human annotators. Our work demonstrates that guided replay using web tutorials is a practical and scalable strategy for training advanced GUI agents, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 Spotlight https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

To support this task, we also introduce a novel evaluation methodology designed to assess whether two intent descriptions can be considered paraphrases within a specific UI environment. Furthermore, we demonstrate how this task can leverage datasets designed for the inverse problem of UI automation, utilizing Android and web datasets for our experiments. To benchmark this task, we compare the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro, using our proposed metric. The results reveal that both Gemini and GPT underperform relative to human performance, underscoring the challenge of the proposed task and the significant room for improvement.

We refer to this type of problem as a multi-task, and we train agents to be versatile in this multi-task setting through a single training process. To address this challenge, we introduce TRajectory-class-Aware Multi-Agent reinforcement learning (TRAMA). In TRAMA, agents recognize a task type by identifying the class of trajectories they are experiencing through partial observations, and the agents use this trajectory awareness or prediction as additional information for action policy. To this end, we introduce three primary objectives in TRAMA: (a) constructing a quantized latent space to generate trajectory embeddings that reflect key similarities among them; (b) conducting trajectory clustering using these trajectory embeddings; and (c) building a trajectory-class-aware policy. Specifically for (c), we introduce a trajectory-class predictor that performs agent-wise predictions on the trajectory class; and we design a trajectory-class representation model for each trajectory class. Each agent takes actions based on this trajectory-class representation along with its partial observation for task-aware execution. The proposed method is evaluated on various tasks, including multi-task problems built upon StarCraft II. Empirical results show further performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contouring Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean projected velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[GDTS: Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for Multi-Modal Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14922v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for improving the safety of autonomous driving. However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Learn Weight Generation via Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01117v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based algorithms have emerged as promising techniques for weight generation, particularly in scenarios like multi-task learning that require frequent weight updates. However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Lt-Di-0E51.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16867v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ET-SEED: Efficient Trajectory-Level SE(3) Equivariant Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03990v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning, e.g., diffusion policy, has been proven effective in various robotic manipulation tasks. However, extensive demonstrations are required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process, making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations with only a few demonstrations.

Our proposal generalizes prior work by allowing the reference process in the Schr\"odinger Bridge problem to be a smooth Gaussian process, leading to more regular and interpretable trajectories in applications. Though na\"ively smoothing the reference process leads to a computationally intractable problem, we identify a class of processes (including the Mat\'ern processes) for which the resulting Smooth Schr\"odinger Bridge problem can be lifted to a simpler problem on phase space, which can be solved in polynomial time. We develop a practical approximation of this algorithm that outperforms existing methods on numerous simulated and real single-cell RNAseq datasets.

To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

In this paper, we present a solution for this problem using a novel drag-aware model formulation which is coupled with MPC, and therefore, enables tracking and landing during high-speed curvilinear trajectories of an USV without any communication. Compared to the state-of-the-art, our approach yields 40% decrease in prediction errors, and provides a 3-fold increase in certainty of predictions. Consequently, this leads to a 30% improvement in tracking performance and 40% higher success in landing on a moving USV even during aggressive turns that are unfeasible for conventional marine missions. We test our approach in two different real-world scenarios with marine vessels of two different sizes and further solidify our results through statistical analysis in simulation to demonstrate the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners require reliable uncertainty estimates of the predicted behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. In particular, decomposing uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components is essential for distinguishing between inherent environmental randomness and model uncertainty, thereby enabling more robust and informed decision-making. This paper addresses the challenge of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction with a holistic approach that emphasizes uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the impact of model composition. Our method, grounded in information theory, provides a theoretically principled way to measure uncertainty and decompose it into aleatoric and epistemic components. Unlike prior work, our approach is compatible with state-of-the-art motion predictors, allowing for broader applicability. We demonstrate its utility by conducting extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset, which shows how different architectures and configurations influence uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2025)</p></details> |

Supervised deep learning methods provide accurate road segmentation in the domain of their training data but cannot be trusted in out-of-distribution scenarios. Including the whole distribution in the trainset is challenging as each sample must be labeled by hand. Trajectory-based self-supervised methods offer a potential solution as they can learn from the traversed route without manual labels. However, existing trajectory-based methods use learning schemes that rely only on the camera or only on the lidar. In this paper, trajectory-based learning is implemented jointly with lidar and camera for increased performance. Our method outperforms recent standalone camera- and lidar-based methods when evaluated with a challenging winter driving dataset including countryside and suburb driving scenes.

Previous studies aim to predict gaze trajectories when humans are free-viewing an image, searching for required targets, or looking for clues to answer questions in an image. While these tasks focus on visual-centric scenarios, humans move their gaze also along with audio signal inputs in more common scenarios. To fill this gap, we introduce a new task that predicts human gaze trajectories in a visual scene with synchronized audio inputs and provide a new dataset containing 20k gaze points from 8 subjects. To effectively integrate audio information and simulate the dynamic process of human gaze motion, we propose a novel learning framework called EyEar (Eye moving while Ear listening) based on physics-informed dynamics, which considers three key factors to predict gazes: eye inherent motion tendency, vision salient attraction, and audio semantic attraction. We also propose a probability density score to overcome the high individual variability of gaze trajectories, thereby improving the stabilization of optimization and the reliability of the evaluation. Experimental results show that EyEar outperforms all the baselines in the context of all evaluation metrics, thanks to the proposed components in the learning model.</p></details> |  |

Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

This paper introduces the Trajectory-to-Action Pipeline (TAP), a scalable and automated method for extracting SDL labels from large trajectory datasets. TAP applies a rules-based cross-entropy optimization approach to learn parameters directly from data, enhancing generalization across diverse driving contexts. Using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), TAP achieves 30% greater precision than Average Displacement Error (ADE) and 24% over Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) in identifying behaviorally similar trajectories. Additionally, TAP enables automated detection of unique driving behaviors, streamlining safety evaluation processes for AV testing. This work provides a foundation for scalable scenario-based AV behavior analysis, with potential extensions for integrating multi-agent contexts.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, the inherently dynamic nature of the heart imposes strict limits on acquisition times, making high-resolution T1 mapping a persistent challenge. Compressed sensing (CS) approaches have reduced scan durations by undersampling k-space and reconstructing images from partial data, and recent studies show that jointly optimizing the undersampling patterns with the reconstruction network can substantially improve performance. Still, most current T1 mapping pipelines rely on static, hand-crafted masks that do not exploit the full acceleration and accuracy potential. In this work, we introduce T1-PILOT: an end-to-end method that explicitly incorporates the T1 signal relaxation model into the sampling-reconstruction framework to guide the learning of non-Cartesian trajectories, crossframe alignment, and T1 decay estimation. Through extensive experiments on the CMRxRecon dataset, T1-PILOT significantly outperforms several baseline strategies (including learned single-mask and fixed radial or golden-angle sampling schemes), achieving higher T1 map fidelity at greater acceleration factors. In particular, we observe consistent gains in PSNR and VIF relative to existing methods, along with marked improvements in delineating finer myocardial structures. Our results highlight that optimizing sampling trajectories in tandem with the physical relaxation model leads to both enhanced quantitative accuracy and reduced acquisition times. Code for reproducing all results will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minds on the Move: Decoding Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving with Cognitive Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20084v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed autonomous driving environments, accurately predicting the future trajectories of surrounding vehicles is crucial for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In driving scenarios, a vehicle's trajectory is determined by the decision-making process of human drivers. However, existing models primarily focus on the inherent statistical patterns in the data, often neglecting the critical aspect of understanding the decision-making processes of human drivers. This oversight results in models that fail to capture the true intentions of human drivers, leading to suboptimal performance in long-term trajectory prediction. To address this limitation, we introduce a Cognitive-Informed Transformer (CITF) that incorporates a cognitive concept, Perceived Safety, to interpret drivers' decision-making mechanisms. Perceived Safety encapsulates the varying risk tolerances across drivers with different driving behaviors. Specifically, we develop a Perceived Safety-aware Module that includes a Quantitative Safety Assessment for measuring the subject risk levels within scenarios, and Driver Behavior Profiling for characterizing driver behaviors. Furthermore, we present a novel module, Leanformer, designed to capture social interactions among vehicles. CITF demonstrates significant performance improvements on three well-established datasets. In terms of long-term prediction, it surpasses existing benchmarks by 12.0% on the NGSIM, 28.2% on the HighD, and 20.8% on the MoCAD dataset. Additionally, its robustness in scenarios with limited or missing data is evident, surpassing most state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines, and paving the way for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Tracailer: An Efficient Trajectory Planner for Tractor-Trailer Vehicles in Unstructured Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19832v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tractor-trailer vehicle (robot) consists of a drivable tractor and one or more non-drivable trailers connected via hitches. Compared to typical car-like robots, the addition of trailers provides greater transportation capability. However, this also complicates motion planning due to the robot's complex kinematics, high-dimensional state space, and deformable structure. To efficiently plan safe, time-optimal trajectories that adhere to the kinematic constraints of the robot and address the challenges posed by its unique features, this paper introduces a lightweight, compact, and high-order smooth trajectory representation for tractor-trailer robots. Based on it, we design an efficiently solvable spatio-temporal trajectory optimization problem. To deal with deformable structures, which leads to difficulties in collision avoidance, we fully leverage the collision-free regions of the environment, directly applying deformations to trajectories in continuous space. This approach not requires constructing safe regions from the environment using convex approximations through collision-free seed points before each optimization, avoiding the loss of the solution space, thus reducing the dependency of the optimization on initial values. Moreover, a multi-terminal fast path search algorithm is proposed to generate the initial values for optimization. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves several-fold improvements in efficiency compared to existing algorithms, while also ensuring lower curvature and trajectory duration. Real-world experiments involving the transportation, loading and unloading of goods in both indoor and outdoor scenarios further validate the effectiveness of our method.

In this paper, a large signal model of the grid-connected VSG is first established. The trajectory reversing method (TRM) is then introduced to estimate the domain of attraction (DOA) of VSG. Subsequently, the transient instability mechanism is revealed in detail based on the estimated DOA boundary. The impacts of system parameters on the DOA range are further investigated. It is found that loss of synchronization (LOS) occurs if the system trajectory lies outside the post-fault DOA range. In scenarios where no equilibrium points exist after a grid fault, system stability can be reestablished only when the fault clearing angle (FCA) does not exceed the critical clearing angle (CCA). Finally, the CCA derived from the DOA and that from the conventional equal area criteria (EAC) are compared. The results show that CCA obtained by our solution has a higher accuracy. Time-domain simulations are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed transient stability analysis method of grid-connected VSG.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,11 figures, references added</p></details> |

Reconstructing a point's 3D motion just from the images captured by only a monocular camera is unfeasible without prior assumptions. Under limited observation conditions such as insufficient observations, long distance, and high observation error of platform, the least squares estimation faces the issue of ill-conditioning. This paper presents an algorithm for reconstructing 3D trajectories of moving points using a monocular camera. The motion of the points is represented through temporal polynomials. Ridge estimation is introduced to mitigate the issues of ill-conditioning caused by limited observation conditions. Then, an automatic algorithm for determining the order of the temporal polynomials is proposed. Furthermore, the definition of reconstructability for temporal polynomials is proposed to describe the reconstruction accuracy quantitatively. The simulated and real-world experimental results demonstrate the feasibility, accuracy, and efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approaches typically focus on separate tasks such as trajectory prediction, imputation, or spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique formulation and constraint of each task, most existing methods are tailored for only one, limiting the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, which is a common requirement in real-world scenarios. Another limitation is that widely used public datasets mainly focus on pedestrian movements with casual, loosely connected patterns, where interactions between individuals are not always present, especially at a long distance, making them less representative of more structured environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios in the domain of sports games. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module, embedded within a Transformer encoder, for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent State Space Models (SSMs), known as the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba (BTM) to better capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to thoroughly scan trajectories while preserving temporal missing relationships. Furthermore, we curate and benchmark three practical sports datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. We hope that our work can advance the understanding of human movement in real-world applications, particularly in sports.

Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Due to the potentially long distance of the UAV's flight, frequent handovers may be incurred among different GBSs, which leads to various practical issues such as large delay and synchronization overhead. To address this problem, we investigate the trajectory optimization of the UAV to minimize the number of GBS handovers during the flight, subject to a communication quality constraint and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Although this problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive useful structures of the optimal solution, based on which we propose an efficient algorithm based on graph theory and Lagrangian relaxation for finding a high-quality suboptimal solution in polynomial time. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed trajectory design.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in IEEE Wireless Communications Letters</p></details> |

Unlike competing-event models, the events here are not mutually exclusive and often exhibit statistical dependencies. Existing approaches for multi-event survival analysis have generally been limited, most focusing on producing simple risk scores for each event, rather than the time-to-event itself. To overcome these issues, we introduce MENSA, a novel deep learning approach for multi-event survival analysis. MENSA jointly learns representations of the input features while capturing the complex dependence structure among events. In practice, it attempts to optimize the sum of the traditional negative log-likelihood across events and a novel trajectory-based likelihood, which encourages the model to learn the temporal order in which events occur. Experiments on real-world clinical datasets show that MENSA consistently gives good discrimination performances and accurate time-to-event predictions in single-event, competing-risk, and multi-event problems. Additionally, MENSA is more computationally-efficient, requiring fewer parameters and FLOPs than multiple state-of-the-art survival baselines when applied to large-dimensional datasets (more than 100 features).</p></details> |  |

However, large datasets of unannotated trajectories containing sequences of various agent behaviour (play trajectories) are often available. In a semi-supervised setup, we explore methods to extract labelled segments from play trajectories. The goal is to augment a small annotated dataset of instruction-trajectory pairs to improve the performance of an instruction-following policy trained downstream via imitation learning. Assuming little variation in segment length, recent video segmentation methods can effectively extract labelled segments. To address the constraint of segment length, we propose Play Segmentation (PS), a probabilistic model that finds maximum likely segmentations of extended subsegments, while only being trained on individual instruction segments. Our results in a game environment and a simulated robotic gripper setting underscore the importance of segmentation; randomly sampled segments diminish performance, while incorporating labelled segments from PS improves policy performance to the level of a policy trained on twice the amount of labelled data.</p></details> |  |

Such environments contain rich features like crosswalks, grass, and curbs, which are easily interpretable by humans, but not by mobile robots. We aim to compute suitable trajectories that (1) satisfy the environment-specific traversability constraints and (2) generate human-like paths while navigating on crosswalks, sidewalks, etc. Our formulation uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) generative model enhanced with traversability constraints to generate multiple candidate trajectories for global navigation. We develop a visual prompting approach and leverage the Visual Language Model's (VLM) zero-shot ability of semantic understanding and logical reasoning to choose the best trajectory given the contextual information about the task. We evaluate our method in various outdoor scenes with wheeled robots and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms. In practice, we observe an average improvement of 20.81% in satisfying traversability constraints and 28.51% in terms of human-like navigation in four different outdoor navigation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure.

Exiting efforts focus on single-frame cooperative perception, however, how to capture the temporal cue between frames with V2X to facilitate the prediction task even the planning task is still underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the Co-MTP, a general cooperative trajectory prediction framework with multi-temporal fusion for autonomous driving, which leverages the V2X system to fully capture the interaction among agents in both history and future domains to benefit the planning. In the history domain, V2X can complement the incomplete history trajectory in single-vehicle perception, and we design a heterogeneous graph transformer to learn the fusion of the history feature from multiple agents and capture the history interaction. Moreover, the goal of prediction is to support future planning. Thus, in the future domain, V2X can provide the prediction results of surrounding objects, and we further extend the graph transformer to capture the future interaction among the ego planning and the other vehicles' intentions and obtain the final future scenario state under a certain planning action. We evaluate the Co-MTP framework on the real-world dataset V2X-Seq, and the results show that Co-MTP achieves state-of-the-art performance and that both history and future fusion can greatly benefit prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Current models, primarily based on structured data, struggle to capture the complete medical context of patients, resulting in a loss of valuable information. To address this issue, we propose an approach that integrates unstructured clinical notes into transformer-based deep learning models for sequential disease prediction. This integration enriches the representation of patients' medical histories, thereby improving the accuracy of diagnosis predictions. Experiments on MIMIC-IV datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms traditional models relying solely on structured data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quadrotor Neural Dead Reckoning in Periodic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17964v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real world scenarios, due to environmental or hardware constraints, the quadrotor is forced to navigate in pure inertial navigation mode while operating indoors or outdoors. To mitigate inertial drift, end-to-end neural network approaches combined with quadrotor periodic trajectories were suggested. There, the quadrotor distance is regressed and combined with inertial model-based heading estimation, the quadrotor position vector is estimated. To further enhance positioning performance, in this paper we propose a quadrotor neural dead reckoning approach for quadrotors flying on periodic trajectories. In this case, the inertial readings are fed into a simple and efficient network to directly estimate the quadrotor position vector. Our approach was evaluated on two different quadrotors, one operating indoors while the other outdoors. Our approach improves the positioning accuracy of other deep-learning approaches, achieving an average 27% reduction in error outdoors and an average 79% reduction indoors, while requiring only software modifications. With the improved positioning accuracy achieved by our method, the quadrotor can seamlessly perform its tasks.</p></details> |  |

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on $\mathsf{QuITO}$ $\textsf{v.2}$ along with all its functionalities for completeness.

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[TraFlow: Trajectory Distillation on Pre-Trained Rectified Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16972v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Majorities of distillation methods on pre-trained diffusion models or on pre-trained rectified flow, focus on either the distillation outputs or the trajectories between random noises and clean images to speed up sample generations from pre-trained models. In those trajectory-based distillation methods, consistency distillation requires the self-consistent trajectory projection to regulate the trajectory, which might avoid the common ODE approximation error {while still be concerning about sampling efficiencies}. At the same time, rectified flow distillations enforce straight trajectory for fast sampling, although an ODE solver is still required. In this work, we propose a trajectory distillation method, \modelname, that enjoys the benefits of both and enables few-step generations. TraFlow adopts the settings of consistency trajectory models, and further enforces the properties of self-consistency and straightness throughout the entire trajectory. These two properties are pursued by reaching a balance with following three targets: (1) reconstruct the output from pre-trained models; (2) learn the amount of changes by pre-trained models; (3) satisfy the self-consistency over its trajectory. Extensive experimental results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterizing Structured versus Unstructured Environments based on Pedestrians' and Vehicles' Motion Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16847v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory behaviours of pedestrians and vehicles operating close to each other can be different in unstructured compared to structured environments. These differences in the motion behaviour are valuable to be considered in the trajectory prediction algorithm of an autonomous vehicle. However, the available datasets on pedestrians' and vehicles' trajectories that are commonly used as benchmarks for trajectory prediction have not been classified based on the nature of their environment. On the other hand, the definitions provided for unstructured and structured environments are rather qualitative and hard to be used for justifying the type of a given environment. In this paper, we have compared different existing datasets based on a couple of extracted trajectory features, such as mean speed and trajectory variability. Through K-means clustering and generalized linear models, we propose more quantitative measures for distinguishing the two different types of environments. Our results show that features such as trajectory variability, stop fraction and density of pedestrians are different among the two environmental types and can be used to classify the existing datasets.</p></details> |  |

While recent research demonstrates the applicability of diffusion models to OOD detection, existing approaches are limited to Euclidean or latent image spaces. Our work extends OOD detection to trajectories in the Special Euclidean Group in 3D ($\mathbb{SE}(3)$), addressing a critical need in computer vision, robotics, and engineering applications that process object pose sequences in $\mathbb{SE}(3)$. We present $\textbf{D}$iffusion-based $\textbf{O}$ut-of-distribution detection on $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ ($\mathbf{DOSE3}$), a novel OOD framework that extends diffusion to a unified sample space of $\mathbb{SE}(3)$ pose sequences. Through extensive validation on multiple benchmark datasets, we demonstrate $\mathbf{DOSE3}$'s superior performance compared to state-of-the-art OOD detection frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Power Transfer-assisted IoT Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17517v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-assisted Internet of Things (IoT) systems face the following challenges: limited resources and suboptimal trajectory planning. Reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning schemes face issues of low search efficiency and learning instability when optimizing large-scale systems. To address these issues, we present an Attention-based UAV Trajectory Optimization (AUTO) framework based on the graph transformer, which consists of an Attention Trajectory Optimization Model (ATOM) and a Trajectory lEarNing Method based on Actor-critic (TENMA). In ATOM, a graph encoder is used to calculate the self-attention characteristics of all IoTDs, and a trajectory decoder is developed to optimize the number and trajectories of UAVs. TENMA then trains the ATOM using an improved Actor-Critic method, in which the real reward of the system is applied as the baseline to reduce variances in the critic network. This method is suitable for high-quality and large-scale multi-UAV trajectory planning. Finally, we develop numerous experiments, including a hardware experiment in the field case, to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the AUTO framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[UAVDB: Trajectory-Guided Adaptable Bounding Boxes for UAV Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06490v5)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) in surveillance, security, and airspace management has created an urgent demand for precise, scalable, and efficient UAV detection. However, existing datasets often suffer from limited scale diversity and inaccurate annotations, hindering robust model development. This paper introduces UAVDB, a high-resolution UAV detection dataset constructed using Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC). This novel technique automatically generates high-fidelity bounding box annotations from UAV trajectory data~\cite{li2020reconstruction}, eliminating the need for manual labeling. UAVDB features single-class annotations with a fixed-camera setup and consists of RGB frames capturing UAVs across various scales, from large-scale UAVs to near-single-pixel representations, along with challenging backgrounds that pose difficulties for modern detectors. We first validate the accuracy and efficiency of PIC-generated bounding boxes by comparing Intersection over Union (IoU) performance and runtime against alternative annotation methods, demonstrating that PIC achieves higher annotation accuracy while being more efficient. Subsequently, we benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO-series detectors, establishing UAVDB as a valuable resource for advancing long-range and high-resolution UAV detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Different from the classical state space model, our series of studies, including this paper, model the collection of the target state as a stochastic process (SP) that is further decomposed into a deterministic part which represents the trend of the trajectory and a residual SP representing the residual fitting error. Subsequently, the tracking problem is formulated as a learning problem regarding the trajectory SP for which a key part is to estimate a trajectory FoT (T-FoT) best fitting the measurements in time series. For this purpose, we consider the polynomial T-FoT and address the regularized polynomial T-FoT optimization employing two distinct regularization strategies seeking trade-off between the accuracy and simplicity. One limits the order of the polynomial and then the best choice is determined by grid searching in a narrow, bounded range while the other adopts $\ell_0$ norm regularization for which the hybrid Newton solver is employed. Simulation results obtained in both single and multiple maneuvering target scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part II of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing PPO with Trajectory-Aware Hybrid Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15968v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal policy optimization (PPO) is one of the most popular state-of-the-art on-policy algorithms that has become a standard baseline in modern reinforcement learning with applications in numerous fields. Though it delivers stable performance with theoretical policy improvement guarantees, high variance, and high sample complexity still remain critical challenges in on-policy algorithms. To alleviate these issues, we propose Hybrid-Policy Proximal Policy Optimization (HP3O), which utilizes a trajectory replay buffer to make efficient use of trajectories generated by recent policies. Particularly, the buffer applies the "first in, first out" (FIFO) strategy so as to keep only the recent trajectories to attenuate the data distribution drift. A batch consisting of the trajectory with the best return and other randomly sampled ones from the buffer is used for updating the policy networks. The strategy helps the agent to improve its capability on top of the most recent best performance and in turn reduce variance empirically. We theoretically construct the policy improvement guarantees for the proposed algorithm. HP3O is validated and compared against several baseline algorithms using multiple continuous control environments. Our code is available here.</p></details> |  |
| **[BP-SGCN: Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network for Pedestrian and Heterogeneous Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14676v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction allows better decision-making in applications of autonomous vehicles or surveillance by predicting the short-term future movement of traffic agents. It is classified into pedestrian or heterogeneous trajectory prediction. The former exploits the relatively consistent behavior of pedestrians, but is limited in real-world scenarios with heterogeneous traffic agents such as cyclists and vehicles. The latter typically relies on extra class label information to distinguish the heterogeneous agents, but such labels are costly to annotate and cannot be generalized to represent different behaviors within the same class of agents. In this work, we introduce the behavioral pseudo-labels that effectively capture the behavior distributions of pedestrians and heterogeneous agents solely based on their motion features, significantly improving the accuracy of trajectory prediction. To implement the framework, we propose the Behavioral Pseudo-Label Informed Sparse Graph Convolution Network (BP-SGCN) that learns pseudo-labels and informs to a trajectory predictor. For optimization, we propose a cascaded training scheme, in which we first learn the pseudo-labels in an unsupervised manner, and then perform end-to-end fine-tuning on the labels in the direction of increasing the trajectory prediction accuracy. Experiments show that our pseudo-labels effectively model different behavior clusters and improve trajectory prediction. Our proposed BP-SGCN outperforms existing methods using both pedestrian (ETH/UCY, pedestrian-only SDD) and heterogeneous agent datasets (SDD, Argoverse 1).</p></details> |  |
| **[A View of the Certainty-Equivalence Method for PAC RL as an Application of the Trajectory Tree Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02652v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) enables an agent interacting with an unknown MDP $M$ to optimise its behaviour by observing transitions sampled from $M$. A natural entity that emerges in the agent's reasoning is $\widehat{M}$, the maximum likelihood estimate of $M$ based on the observed transitions. The well-known \textit{certainty-equivalence} method (CEM) dictates that the agent update its behaviour to $\widehat{\pi}$, which is an optimal policy for $\widehat{M}$. Not only is CEM intuitive, it has been shown to enjoy minimax-optimal sample complexity in some regions of the parameter space for PAC RL with a generative model~\citep{Agarwal2020GenModel}. A seemingly unrelated algorithm is the ``trajectory tree method'' (TTM)~\citep{Kearns+MN:1999}, originally developed for efficient decision-time planning in large POMDPs. This paper presents a theoretical investigation that stems from the surprising finding that CEM may indeed be viewed as an application of TTM. The qualitative benefits of this view are (1) new and simple proofs of sample complexity upper bounds for CEM, in fact under a (2) weaker assumption on the rewards than is prevalent in the current literature. Our analysis applies to both non-stationary and stationary MDPs. Quantitatively, we obtain (3) improvements in the sample-complexity upper bounds for CEM both for non-stationary and stationary MDPs, in the regime that the ``mistake probability'' $\delta$ is small. Additionally, we show (4) a lower bound on the sample complexity for finite-horizon MDPs, which establishes the minimax-optimality of our upper bound for non-stationary MDPs in the small-$\delta$ regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, excluding references and appendices.

| **[Interactive incremental learning of generalizable skills with local trajectory modulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05655v3)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of generalization in learning from demonstration (LfD) has received considerable attention over the years, particularly within the context of movement primitives, where a number of approaches have emerged. Recently, two important approaches have gained recognition. While one leverages via-points to adapt skills locally by modulating demonstrated trajectories, another relies on so-called task-parameterized models that encode movements with respect to different coordinate systems, using a product of probabilities for generalization. While the former are well-suited to precise, local modulations, the latter aim at generalizing over large regions of the workspace and often involve multiple objects. Addressing the quality of generalization by leveraging both approaches simultaneously has received little attention. In this work, we propose an interactive imitation learning framework that simultaneously leverages local and global modulations of trajectory distributions. Building on the kernelized movement primitives (KMP) framework, we introduce novel mechanisms for skill modulation from direct human corrective feedback. Our approach particularly exploits the concept of via-points to incrementally and interactively 1) improve the model accuracy locally, 2) add new objects to the task during execution and 3) extend the skill into regions where demonstrations were not provided. We evaluate our method on a bearing ring-loading task using a torque-controlled, 7-DoF, DLR SARA robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), 16 pages, 19 figures, 6 tables.

| **[From Text to Trajectory: Exploring Complex Constraint Representation and Decomposition in Safe Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08920v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (RL) requires the agent to finish a given task while obeying specific constraints. Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This paper investigates the use of sequential deep learning models, including Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Transformers, for real-time flock detection in multi-pedestrian trajectories. Our proposed approach consists of a two-stage process: first, a pre-trained binary classification model is used for pairwise trajectory classification, and second, the learned representations are applied to identify multi-agent flocks dynamically. We validate our method using real-world group movement datasets, demonstrating its robustness across varying sequence lengths and diverse movement patterns. Experimental results indicate that our model consistently detects pedestrian flocks with high accuracy and stability, even in dynamic and noisy environments. Furthermore, we extend our approach to identify other forms of collective motion, such as convoys and swarms, paving the way for more comprehensive multi-agent behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15043v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Finding Complex Patterns in Trajectory Data via Geometric Set Cover](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14865v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering trajectories is a central challenge when faced with large amounts of movement data such as GPS data. We study a clustering problem that can be stated as a geometric set cover problem: Given a polygonal curve of complexity $n$, find the smallest number $k$ of representative trajectories of complexity at most $l$ such that any point on the input trajectories lies on a subtrajectory of the input that has Fr\'echet distance at most $\Delta$ to one of the representative trajectories. In previous work, Br\"uning et al.~(2022) developed a bicriteria approximation algorithm that returns a set of curves of size $O(kl\log(kl))$ which covers the input with a radius of $11\Delta$ in time $\widetilde{O}((kl)^2n + kln^3)$, where $k$ is the smallest number of curves of complexity $l$ needed to cover the input with a radius of $\Delta$. The representative trajectories computed by this algorithm are always line segments. In the applications however, one is usually interested in more complex representative curves which consist of several edges. We present a new approach that builds upon previous work computing a set of curves of size $O(k\log(n))$ in time $\widetilde{O}(l^2n^4 + kln^4)$ with the same distance guarantee of $11\Delta$, where each curve may consist of curves of complexity up to the given complexity parameter~$l$. We conduct experiments on tracking data of ocean currents and full body motion data suggesting its validity as a tool for analyzing large spatio-temporal data sets.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

In practice, however, MPPI often struggles to guarantee safety assurance and balance efficient sampling in open spaces with the need for more extensive exploration under tight constraints. To address this challenge, we incorporate discrete barrier states (DBaS) into MPPI and propose a novel MPPI-DBaS algorithm that ensures system safety and enables adaptive exploration across diverse scenarios. We evaluate our method in simulation experiments where the vehicle navigates through closely placed obstacles. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms standard MPPI, achieving a higher success rate and lower tracking errors.</p></details> | CCC 2025 |

Existing work primarily focuses on behavior cloning from expert demonstrations and preference learning through exploratory trajectory sampling. However, these methods often struggle in long-horizon tasks, where suboptimal actions accumulate step by step, causing agents to deviate from correct task trajectories. To address this, we highlight the importance of timely calibration and the need to automatically construct calibration trajectories for training agents. We propose Step-Level Trajectory Calibration (STeCa), a novel framework for LLM agent learning. Specifically, STeCa identifies suboptimal actions through a step-level reward comparison during exploration. It constructs calibrated trajectories using LLM-driven reflection, enabling agents to learn from improved decision-making processes. These calibrated trajectories, together with successful trajectory data, are utilized for reinforced training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STeCa significantly outperforms existing methods. Further analysis highlights that step-level calibration enables agents to complete tasks with greater robustness.

The proposed framework leverages the potential of the complementarity constraint as a decision-maker and an indicator for diverse cooperative tasks and extends it to the collaborative landing scenario. In a potential application of the proposed methodology, a ground mobile robot may serve as a mobile charging station and coordinates in real-time with a quadrotor to be charged, facilitating a safe and efficient rendezvous and landing. We verified the generated trajectories in simulation and real-world applications, demonstrating the real-time capabilities of the proposed landing planning framework.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge lies in leveraging latent spatiotemporal correlations within RSS data while navigating complex road networks. To address this, we develop a Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based RSS embedding (HRE) technique that employs alternating optimization to infer vehicle trajectories from RSS measurements. This model captures spatiotemporal dependencies while a road graph ensures network compliance. Additionally, we introduce a maximum speed-constrained rough trajectory estimation (MSR) method to guide the optimization process, enabling rapid convergence to a favorable local solution.</p></details> |  |

While open-source LMM agents have made significant advances in offline evaluation benchmarks, their performance still falls substantially short of human-level capabilities in more realistic online settings. A key bottleneck is the lack of diverse and large-scale trajectory-level datasets across various domains, which are expensive to collect. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a scalable recipe to synthesize the largest and most diverse trajectory-level dataset to date, containing over 94K successful multimodal web trajectories, spanning 49K unique URLs, 720K screenshots, and 33M web elements. In particular, we leverage extensive web exploration and refinement to obtain diverse task intents. The average cost is 28 cents per successful trajectory, making it affordable to a wide range of users in the community. Leveraging this dataset, we train Explorer, a multimodal web agent, and demonstrate strong performance on both offline and online web agent benchmarks such as Mind2Web-Live, Multimodal-Mind2Web, and MiniWob++. Additionally, our experiments highlight data scaling as a key driver for improving web agent capabilities. We hope this study makes state-of-the-art LMM-based agent research at a larger scale more accessible.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |
| **[BoundPlanner: A convex-set-based approach to bounded manipulator trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13286v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online trajectory planning enables robot manipulators to react quickly to changing environments or tasks. Many robot trajectory planners exist for known environments but are often too slow for online computations. Current methods in online trajectory planning do not find suitable trajectories in challenging scenarios that respect the limits of the robot and account for collisions. This work proposes a trajectory planning framework consisting of the novel Cartesian path planner based on convex sets, called BoundPlanner, and the online trajectory planner BoundMPC. BoundPlanner explores and maps the collision-free space using convex sets to compute a reference path with bounds. BoundMPC is extended in this work to handle convex sets for path deviations, which allows the robot to optimally follow the path within the bounds while accounting for the robot's kinematics. Collisions of the robot's kinematic chain are considered by a novel convex-set-based collision avoidance formulation independent on the number of obstacles.

Our vehicle simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.

| **[Learning Plasma Dynamics and Robust Rampdown Trajectories with Predict-First Experiments at TCV](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12327v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rampdown in tokamak operations is a difficult to simulate phase during which the plasma is often pushed towards multiple instability limits. To address this challenge, and reduce the risk of disrupting operations, we leverage recent advances in Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) to develop a neural state-space model (NSSM) that predicts plasma dynamics during Tokamak \`a Configuration Variable (TCV) rampdowns. By integrating simple physics structure and data-driven models, the NSSM efficiently learns plasma dynamics during the rampdown from a modest dataset of 311 pulses with only five pulses in the reactor relevant high performance regime. The NSSM is parallelized across uncertainties, and reinforcement learning (RL) is applied to design trajectories that avoid multiple instability limits with high probability. Experiments at TCV ramping down high performance plasmas show statistically significant improvements in current and energy at plasma termination, with improvements in speed through continuous re-training. A predict-first experiment, increasing plasma current by 20\% from baseline, demonstrates the NSSM's ability to make small extrapolations with sufficient accuracy to design trajectories that successfully terminate the pulse. The developed approach paves the way for designing tokamak controls with robustness to considerable uncertainty, and demonstrates the relevance of the SciML approach to learning plasma dynamics for rapidly developing robust trajectories and controls during the incremental campaigns of upcoming burning plasma tokamaks.</p></details> |  |

Existing RL-based fine-tuning methods focus on single training timesteps and neglect trajectory-level alignment, while recent sampling trajectory optimization methods incur significant inference NFE costs. Diffusion-Sharpening overcomes this by using a path integral framework to select optimal trajectories during training, leveraging reward feedback, and amortizing inference costs. Our method demonstrates superior training efficiency with faster convergence, and best inference efficiency without requiring additional NFEs. Extensive experiments show that Diffusion-Sharpening outperforms RL-based fine-tuning methods (e.g., Diffusion-DPO) and sampling trajectory optimization methods (e.g., Inference Scaling) across diverse metrics including text alignment, compositional capabilities, and human preferences, offering a scalable and efficient solution for future diffusion model fine-tuning.

| **[Leader and Follower: Interactive Motion Generation under Trajectory Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11563v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of game and film production, generating interactive motion from texts has garnered significant attention due to its potential to revolutionize content creation processes. In many practical applications, there is a need to impose strict constraints on the motion range or trajectory of virtual characters. However, existing methods that rely solely on textual input face substantial challenges in accurately capturing the user's intent, particularly in specifying the desired trajectory. As a result, the generated motions often lack plausibility and accuracy. Moreover, existing trajectory - based methods for customized motion generation rely on retraining for single - actor scenarios, which limits flexibility and adaptability to different datasets, as well as interactivity in two-actor motions. To generate interactive motion following specified trajectories, this paper decouples complex motion into a Leader - Follower dynamic, inspired by role allocation in partner dancing. Based on this framework, this paper explores the motion range refinement process in interactive motion generation and proposes a training-free approach, integrating a Pace Controller and a Kinematic Synchronization Adapter. The framework enhances the ability of existing models to generate motion that adheres to trajectory by controlling the leader's movement and correcting the follower's motion to align with the leader. Experimental results show that the proposed approach, by better leveraging trajectory information, outperforms existing methods in both realism and accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A linear-time algorithm computing the resident fitness in interacting trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11561v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The notion of a system of interacting trajectories was recently introduced by Hermann, Gonz\'alez Casanova, Soares dos Santos, T\'obi\'as and Wakolbinger. Such a system of $[0,1]$-valued piecewise linear trajectories arises as a scaling limit of the system of logarithmic subpopulation sizes in a certain population-genetic model (more precisely, a Moran model) with mutation and selection. By definition, the resident fitness is initially 0 and afterwards it increases by the ultimate slope of each trajectory that reaches height 1. We show that although the interaction of $n$ trajectories may yield $\Omega(n^2)$ slope changes in total, the resident fitness (at all times) can be computed algorithmically in $O(n)$ time. Our algorithm is given in terms of the so-called continued lines representation of the system of interacting trajectories. In the special case of Poissonian interacting trajectories where the birth times of the trajectories form a Poisson process and the initial slopes are random and i.i.d., we show that even the expected number of slope changes grows only linearly in time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Computational Complexity of Rigidity-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Real-Time Cooperative Target Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11278v1)** | 2025-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and swift localization of the target is crucial in emergencies. However, accurate position data of a target mobile device, typically obtained from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), cellular networks, or WiFi, may not always be accessible to first responders. For instance, 1) accuracy and availability can be limited in challenging signal reception environments, and 2) in regions where emergency location services are not mandatory, certain mobile devices may not transmit their location during emergencies. As an alternative localization method, a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to passively locate targets by collecting radio frequency (RF) signal measurements, such as received signal strength (RSS). In these situations, UAV trajectories play a critical role in localization performance, influencing both accuracy and search time. Previous studies optimized UAV trajectories using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), but its performance declines under unfavorable geometric conditions, such as when UAVs start from a single base, leading to position ambiguity. To address this, our prior work introduced a rigidity-based approach, which improved the search time compared to FIM-based methods in our simulation case. However, the high computational cost of rigidity-based optimization, primarily due to singular value decomposition (SVD), limits its practicality. In this paper, we applied techniques to reduce computational complexity, including randomized SVD, smooth SVD, and vertex pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ION ITM 2025</p></details> |

Past research relied on incorporating deterministic future states of surrounding pedestrians which can be overconfident leading to unsafe robot behaviour. The current paper proposes a predictive uncertainty-aware planner that integrates neural network based probabilistic trajectory prediction into planning. Our method uses a deep ensemble based network for probabilistic forecasting of surrounding humans and integrates the predictive uncertainty as constraints into the planner. We compare numerous constraint satisfaction methods on the planner and evaluated its performance on real world pedestrian datasets. Further, offline robot navigation was carried out on out-of-distribution pedestrian trajectories inside a narrow corridor</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy for Long-horizon Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10040v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision-Language-Action models (VLA) have advanced robot imitation learning, but high data collection costs and limited demonstrations hinder generalization and current imitation learning methods struggle in out-of-distribution scenarios, especially for long-horizon tasks. A key challenge is how to mitigate compounding errors in imitation learning, which lead to cascading failures over extended trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose the Diffusion Trajectory-guided Policy (DTP) framework, which generates 2D trajectories through a diffusion model to guide policy learning for long-horizon tasks. By leveraging task-relevant trajectories, DTP provides trajectory-level guidance to reduce error accumulation. Our two-stage approach first trains a generative vision-language model to create diffusion-based trajectories, then refines the imitation policy using them. Experiments on the CALVIN benchmark show that DTP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 25% in success rate, starting from scratch without external pretraining. Moreover, DTP significantly improves real-world robot performance.</p></details> |  |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We frame this problem as an instance of abduction guided by a novel parsimony function represented as an aggregate truth value over an annotated logic program. This approach has the added benefit of affording explainability to an analyst user. By showing that any subset of such a program can provide a lower bound on this parsimony requirement, we are able to abduce movement trajectories efficiently through an informed (i.e., A*) search. We describe how our implementation was enhanced with the application of multiple techniques in order to be scaled and integrated with a cloud-based software stack that included bottom-up rule learning, geolocated knowledge graph retrieval/management, and interfaces with government systems for independently conducted government-run tests for which we provide results. We also report on our own experiments showing that we not only provide exact results but also scale to very large scenarios and provide realistic agent trajectories that can go undetected by machine learning anomaly detectors.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

Using this high-quality input, we propose a system based on Trajectron++, able to consistently generate precise trajectory predictions.

Our analysis demonstrates that poor quality input leads to noisy and unreliable predictions, which can be detrimental to navigation modules. We evaluate both input data quality and model output to illustrate the impact of input noise. Furthermore, we show that our estimation system enables effective training of trajectory prediction models even with limited data, producing robust predictions across different environments. Accurate estimations are crucial for deploying trajectory prediction models in real-world scenarios, and our system ensures meaningful and reliable results across various application contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, IEEE INTELLIGENT VEHICLES SYMPOSIUM (IV 2025)</p></details> |

However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address this challenge, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. In real-world driving, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical trajectory, but also by the behavior of other vehicles. So, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between vehicles. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose an endpoint prediction module for the target vehicle. This module predicts the target vehicle endpoints, refines them using a correction mechanism, and generates a multimodal predicted trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset.

One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods. The code and model will be released at https://github.com/JianzeLi-114/FluxSR.</p></details> |  |

Cycling data has especially been the focus of data collection endeavors in recent years. Although privacy risks regarding location data are widely known, practitioners often refrain from advanced privacy mechanisms to prevent utility losses. Removing user identifiers from trips is thereby deemed a major privacy gain, as it supposedly prevents linking single trips to obtain entire movement patterns. In this paper, we propose a novel attack to reconstruct user identifiers in GPS trip datasets consisting of single trips, unlike previous ones that are dedicated to evaluating trajectory-user linking in the context of check-in data. We evaluate the remaining privacy risk for users in such datasets and our empirical findings from two real-world datasets show that the risk of re-identification is significant even when personal identifiers have been removed, and that truncation as a simple additional privacy mechanism may not be effective in protecting user privacy. Further investigations indicate that users who frequently visit locations that are only visited by a small number of others, tend to be more vulnerable to re-identification.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures |

Existing methods, however, often obscure critical local hotspots by only considering the start and end positions of objects' trajectories. To address this gap, we propose RouteFlow, a trajectory-aware animated transition method that effectively balances the global trend and local hotspots while minimizing occlusion. RouteFlow is inspired by a real-world bus route analogy: objects are regarded as passengers traveling together, with local hotspots representing bus stops where these passengers get on and off. Based on this analogy, animation paths are generated like bus routes, with the object layout generated similarly to seat allocation according to their destinations. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, RouteFlow better facilitates identifying the global trend and locating local hotspots while performing comparably in tracking objects' movements.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |

As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Despite significant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the high-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations among multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence patterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest (POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on different trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by disparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory User Linking model (HGTUL). Our model learns trajectory representations from both relational and spatio-temporal perspectives: (1) it captures high-order associations among trajectories by constructing a trajectory hypergraph and leverages a hypergraph attention network to learn the variable impact of POIs on trajectories; (2) it models the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories by incorporating their temporal and spatial information into a sequential encoder. Moreover, we design a data balancing method to effectively address the user class imbalance problem and experimentally validate its significance in TUL. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGTUL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 2.57%~20.09% and 5.68%~26.00% in ACC@1 and Macro-F1 metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PLMTrajRec: A Scalable and Generalizable Trajectory Recovery Method with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is crucial for various applications. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -- the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep -- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |

However, their optimal power management poses significant challenges: the underlying high-dimensional nonlinear nonconvex optimization lacks computational tractability in real-world implementation, and the uncertainty of the exogenous power demand makes exact optimization difficult. This paper presents a new solution framework to address these bottlenecks. The solution pivots on introducing power-sharing ratios to specify each cell's power quota from the output power demand. To find the optimal power-sharing ratios, we formulate a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) problem to achieve power-loss-minimizing BESS operation while complying with safety, cell balancing, and power supply-demand constraints. We then propose a parameterized control policy for the power-sharing ratios, which utilizes only three parameters, to reduce the computational demand in solving the NMPC problem. This policy parameterization allows us to translate the NMPC problem into a Bayesian inference problem for the sake of 1) computational tractability, and 2) overcoming the nonconvexity of the optimization problem. We leverage the ensemble Kalman inversion technique to solve the parameter estimation problem. Concurrently, a low-level control loop is developed to seamlessly integrate our proposed approach with the BESS to ensure practical implementation. This low-level controller receives the optimal power-sharing ratios, generates output power references for the cells, and maintains a balance between power supply and demand despite uncertainty in output power. We conduct extensive simulations and experiments on a 20-cell prototype to validate the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present a model merging methodology that addresses the difficulty of fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) for target tasks in non-English languages, where task-specific data is often unavailable. We focus on mathematical reasoning and without in-language math data, facilitate cross-lingual transfer by composing language and math capabilities. Starting from the same pretrained model, we fine-tune separate "experts" on math instruction data in English and on generic instruction data in the target language. We then replace the top and bottom transformer layers of the math expert directly with layers from the language expert, which consequently enhances math performance in the target language. The resulting merged models outperform the individual experts and other merging methods on the math benchmark, MGSM, by 10% across four major languages where math instruction data is scarce. In addition, this layer swapping is simple, inexpensive, and intuitive, as it is based on an interpretative analysis of the most important parameter changes during the fine-tuning of each expert. The ability to successfully re-compose LLMs for cross-lingual transfer in this manner opens up future possibilities to combine model expertise, create modular solutions, and transfer reasoning capabilities across languages all post hoc.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, Spotlight Paper, In The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models are Powerful EHR Encoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17403v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic Health Records (EHRs) offer rich potential for clinical prediction, yet their inherent complexity and heterogeneity pose significant challenges for traditional machine learning approaches. Domain-specific EHR foundation models trained on large collections of unlabeled EHR data have demonstrated promising improvements in predictive accuracy and generalization; however, their training is constrained by limited access to diverse, high-quality datasets and inconsistencies in coding standards and healthcare practices. In this study, we explore the possibility of using general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) based embedding methods as EHR encoders. By serializing patient records into structured Markdown text, transforming codes into human-readable descriptors, we leverage the extensive generalization capabilities of LLMs pretrained on vast public corpora, thereby bypassing the need for proprietary medical datasets. We systematically evaluate two state-of-the-art LLM-embedding models, GTE-Qwen2-7B-Instruct and LLM2Vec-Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, across 15 diverse clinical prediction tasks from the EHRSHOT benchmark, comparing their performance to an EHRspecific foundation model, CLIMBR-T-Base, and traditional machine learning baselines. Our results demonstrate that LLM-based embeddings frequently match or exceed the performance of specialized models, even in few-shot settings, and that their effectiveness scales with the size of the underlying LLM and the available context window. Overall, our findings demonstrate that repurposing LLMs for EHR encoding offers a scalable and effective approach for clinical prediction, capable of overcoming the limitations of traditional EHR modeling and facilitating more interoperable and generalizable healthcare applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Safe AI Clinicians: A Comprehensive Study on Large Language Model Jailbreaking in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18632v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in healthcare applications. However, their deployment in clinical practice raises significant safety concerns, including the potential spread of harmful information. This study systematically assesses the vulnerabilities of seven LLMs to three advanced black-box jailbreaking techniques within medical contexts. To quantify the effectiveness of these techniques, we propose an automated and domain-adapted agentic evaluation pipeline. Experiment results indicate that leading commercial and open-source LLMs are highly vulnerable to medical jailbreaking attacks. To bolster model safety and reliability, we further investigate the effectiveness of Continual Fine-Tuning (CFT) in defending against medical adversarial attacks. Our findings underscore the necessity for evolving attack methods evaluation, domain-specific safety alignment, and LLM safety-utility balancing. This research offers actionable insights for advancing the safety and reliability of AI clinicians, contributing to ethical and effective AI deployment in healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Multilingual Previously Fact-Checked Claim Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02737v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our era of widespread false information, human fact-checkers often face the challenge of duplicating efforts when verifying claims that may have already been addressed in other countries or languages. As false information transcends linguistic boundaries, the ability to automatically detect previously fact-checked claims across languages has become an increasingly important task. This paper presents the first comprehensive evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection. We assess seven LLMs across 20 languages in both monolingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that while LLMs perform well for high-resource languages, they struggle with low-resource languages. Moreover, translating original texts into English proved to be beneficial for low-resource languages. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs for multilingual previously fact-checked claim detection and provide a foundation for further research on this promising application of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Although organizations or enterprises have dedicated personnel responsible for reviewing these logs, it is impossible to manually examine all logs entirely. In response to the vast number of logs, we propose a system called RedChronos, which is a Large Language Model-Based Log Analysis System. This system incorporates innovative improvements over previous research by employing Query-Aware Weighted Voting and a Semantic Expansion-based Genetic Algorithm with LLM-driven Mutations. On the public datasets CERT 4.2 and 5.2, RedChronos outperforms or matches existing approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, and detection rate. Moreover, RedChronos reduces the need for manual intervention in security log reviews by 90\% in the Xiaohongshu SOC. Therefore, our RedChronos system demonstrates exceptional performance in handling Internal Threat Detection (IDT) tasks, providing innovative solutions for these challenges. We believe that future research can continue to enhance the system's performance in IDT tasks while also reducing the response time to internal risk events.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoRA-Null: Low-Rank Adaptation via Null Space for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02659v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is the leading parameter-efficient fine-tuning method for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the fine-tuned LLMs encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting of the pre-trained world knowledge. To address this issue, inspired by theoretical insights of null space, we propose LoRA-Null, i.e., Low-Rank Adaptation via null space, which builds adapters initialized from the null space of the pre-trained knowledge activation. Concretely, we randomly collect a few data samples and capture their activations after passing through the LLM layer. We perform Singular Value Decomposition on the input activations to obtain their null space. We use the projection of the pre-trained weights onto the null space as the initialization for adapters. Experimental results demonstrate that this initialization approach can effectively preserve the original pre-trained world knowledge of the LLMs during fine-tuning. Additionally, if we freeze the values of the down-projection matrices during fine-tuning, it achieves even better preservation of the pre-trained world knowledge. LoRA-Null effectively preserves pre-trained world knowledge while maintaining strong fine-tuning performance, as validated by extensive experiments on LLaMA series (LLaMA2, LLaMA3, LLaMA3.1, and LLaMA3.2) across Code, Math, and Instruction Following tasks. We also provide a theoretical guarantee for the capacity of LoRA-Null to retain pre-trained knowledge. Code is in https://github.com/HungerPWAY/LoRA-Null.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Taxonomy for Autonomy in Large-Scale Agile Software Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02651v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agile development relies on self-organizing teams having a high degree of autonomy. For single-team development, more autonomy is generally considered better. In large-scale agile development, where several teams collaborate on the same software with technical and social dependencies, finding the right balance between autonomy and organizational control becomes critical. To this end, it is helpful to have a framework that helps reason about autonomy to help map out to what degree teams can be autonomous, and in what aspects that autonomy needs to be restricted. This paper presents our work towards building a framework for autonomy in large-scale agile development. The preliminary version identifies five levels, and 21 categories of autonomy grouped into three areas. These aspects of autonomy can be taken into account when analyzing or defining the limits of autonomy in large-scale agile software development. The use of the framework is illustrated with an example.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Transforming Unstructured Text to Standardized Formats](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02650v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exponential growth of unstructured text data presents a fundamental challenge in modern data management and information retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural language processing, their potential to transform unstructured text into standardized, structured formats remains largely unexplored - a capability that could revolutionize data processing workflows across industries. This study breaks new ground by systematically evaluating LLMs' ability to convert unstructured recipe text into the structured Cooklang format. Through comprehensive testing of four models (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, Llama3.1:70b, and Llama3.1:8b), an innovative evaluation approach is introduced that combines traditional metrics (WER, ROUGE-L, TER) with specialized metrics for semantic element identification. Our experiments reveal that GPT-4o with few-shot prompting achieves breakthrough performance (ROUGE-L: 0.9722, WER: 0.0730), demonstrating for the first time that LLMs can reliably transform domain-specific unstructured text into structured formats without extensive training. Although model performance generally scales with size, we uncover surprising potential in smaller models like Llama3.1:8b for optimization through targeted fine-tuning. These findings open new possibilities for automated structured data generation across various domains, from medical records to technical documentation, potentially transforming the way organizations process and utilize unstructured information.</p></details> |  |

Prompting Large Language Models for Aspect Sentiment Quad Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13044v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect sentiment quadruple prediction (ASQP) facilitates a detailed understanding of opinions expressed in a text by identifying the opinion term, aspect term, aspect category and sentiment polarity for each opinion. However, annotating a full set of training examples to fine-tune models for ASQP is a resource-intensive process. In this study, we explore the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) for zero- and few-shot learning on the ASQP task across five diverse datasets. We report F1 scores slightly below those obtained with state-of-the-art fine-tuned models but exceeding previously reported zero- and few-shot performance. In the 40-shot setting on the Rest16 restaurant domain dataset, LLMs achieved an F1 score of 52.46, compared to 60.39 by the best-performing fine-tuned method MVP. Additionally, we report the performance of LLMs in target aspect sentiment detection (TASD), where the F1 scores were also close to fine-tuned models, achieving 66.03 on Rest16 in the 40-shot setting, compared to 72.76 with MVP. While human annotators remain essential for achieving optimal performance, LLMs can reduce the need for extensive manual annotation in ASQP tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rewarding Doubt: A Reinforcement Learning Approach to Confidence Calibration of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02623v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A safe and trustworthy use of Large Language Models (LLMs) requires an accurate expression of confidence in their answers. We introduce a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach for LLM calibration that fine-tunes LLMs to elicit calibrated confidence estimations in their answers to factual questions. We model the problem as a betting game where the model predicts a confidence score together with every answer, and design a reward function that penalizes both over and under-confidence. We prove that under our reward design an optimal policy would result in a perfectly calibrated confidence estimation. Our experiments demonstrate significantly improved confidence calibration and generalization to new tasks without re-training, indicating that our approach teaches a general confidence awareness. This approach enables the training of inherently calibrated LLMs.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents the first comprehensive survey on PGen, investigating existing research in this rapidly growing field. We conceptualize PGen from a unified perspective, systematically formalizing its key components, core objectives, and abstract workflows. Based on this unified perspective, we propose a multi-level taxonomy, offering an in-depth review of technical advancements, commonly used datasets, and evaluation metrics across multiple modalities, personalized contexts, and tasks. Moreover, we envision the potential applications of PGen and highlight open challenges and promising directions for future exploration. By bridging PGen research across multiple modalities, this survey serves as a valuable resource for fostering knowledge sharing and interdisciplinary collaboration, ultimately contributing to a more personalized digital landscape.</p></details> |  |

Despite their significance, there has been little systematic and empirical research on this concept due to issues of measurement and operationalization. We introduce an iterative human-in-the-loop method to identify media storms in a large-scale corpus of news articles. The text is first transformed into signals of dispersion based on several textual characteristics. In each iteration, we apply unsupervised anomaly detection to these signals; each anomaly is then validated by an expert to confirm the presence of a storm, and those results are then used to tune the anomaly detection in the next iteration. We demonstrate the applicability of this method in two scenarios: first, supplementing an initial list of media storms within a specific time frame; and second, detecting media storms in new time periods. We make available a media storm dataset compiled using both scenarios. Both the method and dataset offer the basis for comprehensive empirical research into the concept of media storms, including characterizing them and predicting their outbursts and durations, in mainstream media or social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted and published in Findings of EMNLP 2024.

In this paper we explore if large language models (LLMs) can play games, investigating their capabilities for randomisation and strategic adaptation through both simultaneous and sequential game interactions. We focus on GPT-4o-Mini-2024-08-17 and test two games between LLMs: Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) and games of strategy (Prisoners Dilemma PD). LLMs are often described as stochastic parrots, and while they may indeed be parrots, our results suggest that they are not very stochastic in the sense that their outputs - when prompted to be random - are often very biased. Our research reveals that LLMs appear to develop loss aversion strategies in repeated games, with RPS converging to stalemate conditions while PD shows systematic shifts between cooperative and competitive outcomes based on prompt design. We detail programmatic tools for independent agent interactions and the Agentic AI challenges faced in implementation. We show that LLMs can indeed play games, just not very well. These results have implications for the use of LLMs in multi-agent LLM systems and showcase limitations in current approaches to model output for strategic decision-making.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This throws into question popular single-prompt evaluation practices. We present DOVE (Dataset Of Variation Evaluation) a large-scale dataset containing prompt perturbations of various evaluation benchmarks. In contrast to previous work, we examine LLM sensitivity from an holistic perspective, and assess the joint effects of perturbations along various dimensions, resulting in thousands of perturbations per instance. We evaluate several model families against DOVE, leading to several findings, including efficient methods for choosing well-performing prompts, observing that few-shot examples reduce sensitivity, and identifying instances which are inherently hard across all perturbations. DOVE consists of more than 250M prompt perturbations and model outputs, which we make publicly available to spur a community-wide effort toward meaningful, robust, and efficient evaluation.

Current datasets fall short in scale, realism and do not capture the multimodal nature of OR scenes, limiting progress in OR modeling. To this end, we introduce MM-OR, a realistic and large-scale multimodal spatiotemporal OR dataset, and the first dataset to enable multimodal scene graph generation. MM-OR captures comprehensive OR scenes containing RGB-D data, detail views, audio, speech transcripts, robotic logs, and tracking data and is annotated with panoptic segmentations, semantic scene graphs, and downstream task labels. Further, we propose MM2SG, the first multimodal large vision-language model for scene graph generation, and through extensive experiments, demonstrate its ability to effectively leverage multimodal inputs. Together, MM-OR and MM2SG establish a new benchmark for holistic OR understanding, and open the path towards multimodal scene analysis in complex, high-stakes environments.

| **[A Multi-Sensor Fusion Approach for Rapid Orthoimage Generation in Large-Scale UAV Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01202v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid generation of large-scale orthoimages from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has been a long-standing focus of research in the field of aerial mapping. A multi-sensor UAV system, integrating the Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), 4D millimeter-wave radar and camera, can provide an effective solution to this problem. In this paper, we utilize multi-sensor data to overcome the limitations of conventional orthoimage generation methods in terms of temporal performance, system robustness, and geographic reference accuracy. A prior-pose-optimized feature matching method is introduced to enhance matching speed and accuracy, reducing the number of required features and providing precise references for the Structure from Motion (SfM) process. The proposed method exhibits robustness in low-texture scenes like farmlands, where feature matching is difficult. Experiments show that our approach achieves accurate feature matching orthoimage generation in a short time. The proposed drone system effectively aids in farmland detection and management.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback Framework for Large Language Model Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02519v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents typically adopt a step-by-step reasoning framework, in which they interleave the processes of thinking and acting to accomplish the given task. However, this paradigm faces a deep-rooted one-pass issue whereby each generated intermediate thought is plugged into the trajectory regardless of its correctness, which can cause irreversible error propagation. To address the issue, this paper proposes a novel framework called Generator-Assistant Stepwise Rollback (GA-Rollback) to induce better decision-making for LLM agents. Particularly, GA-Rollback utilizes a generator to interact with the environment and an assistant to examine each action produced by the generator, where the assistant triggers a rollback operation upon detection of incorrect actions. Moreover, we introduce two additional strategies tailored for the rollback scenario to further improve its effectiveness. Extensive experiments show that GA-Rollback achieves significant improvements over several strong baselines on three widely used benchmarks. Our analysis further reveals that GA-Rollback can function as a robust plug-and-play module, integrating seamlessly with other methods.</p></details> |  |

In our work, we leverage parameter-efficient, gradient-based unlearning using low-rank (LoRA) adaptation and layer-focused fine-tuning. To further enhance unlearning effectiveness, we employ data chunking, splitting forget data into disjoint partitions and merging them with cyclically sampled retain samples at a pre-defined ratio. Our task-agnostic method achieves an outstanding forget-retain balance, ranking first on leaderboards and significantly outperforming baselines and competing systems.</p></details> |  |

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative story-writing capabilities remain under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across 60 LLMs and 60 people using a five-sentence creative story-writing task. We use measures to automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, diversity, and linguistic complexity. We also collect creativity ratings and Turing Test classifications from non-expert and expert human raters and LLMs. Automated metrics show that LLMs generate stylistically complex stories, but tend to fall short in terms of novelty, surprise and diversity when compared to average human writers. Expert ratings generally coincide with automated metrics. However, LLMs and non-experts rate LLM stories to be more creative than human-generated stories. We discuss why and how these differences in ratings occur, and their implications for both human and artificial creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICCC 2025</p></details> |

Indoor VLN has been extensively studied, whereas outdoor aerial VLN remains underexplored. The potential reason is that outdoor aerial view encompasses vast areas, making data collection more challenging, which results in a lack of benchmarks. To address this problem, we propose OpenFly, a platform comprising a versatile toolchain and large-scale benchmark for aerial VLN. Firstly, we develop a highly automated toolchain for data collection, enabling automatic point cloud acquisition, scene semantic segmentation, flight trajectory creation, and instruction generation. Secondly, based on the toolchain, we construct a large-scale aerial VLN dataset with 100k trajectories, covering diverse heights and lengths across 18 scenes. The corresponding visual data are generated using various rendering engines and advanced techniques, including Unreal Engine, GTA V, Google Earth, and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D GS). All data exhibit high visual quality. Particularly, 3D GS supports real-to-sim rendering, further enhancing the realism of the dataset. Thirdly, we propose OpenFly-Agent, a keyframe-aware VLN model, which takes language instructions, current observations, and historical keyframes as input, and outputs flight actions directly. Extensive analyses and experiments are conducted, showcasing the superiority of our OpenFly platform and OpenFly-Agent. The toolchain, dataset, and codes will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce Llamarine, the first open-source LLM designed specifically for maritime navigation. Llamarine 1.0 is developed through continued pretraining and fine-tuning on a high-quality corpus comprising maritime textbooks, research publications, and web text from Wikipedia. This domain-specific training enables the model to acquire expert-level knowledge in navigational principles, collision avoidance, route optimization, and regulatory compliance. Our key contributions include (a) the curation of a comprehensive maritime dataset from authoritative sources, ensuring depth and reliability in the model's knowledge base; (b) the development of a foundational model capable of reasoning about complex navigational challenges with greater accuracy than general-purpose LLMs; and (c) the establishment of a benchmark to evaluate performance in maritime-specific decision-making tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that Llamarine outperforms both general-purpose and commercial LLMs in critical navigation-related tasks, such as trajectory planning, risk assessment, and compliance with maritime regulations. By providing an open-source foundation model trained exclusively on high-quality maritime literature, Llamarine paves the way for AI-driven advancements in maritime safety, efficiency, and operational decision-making.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This paper introduces DART-LLM, a novel framework that employs Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) to model task dependencies, enabling the decomposition of natural language instructions into well-coordinated subtasks for multi-robot execution. DART-LLM comprises four key components: a Question-Answering (QA) LLM module for dependency-aware task decomposition, a Breakdown Function module for robot assignment, an Actuation module for execution, and a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based object detector for environmental perception, achieving end-to-end task execution. Experimental results across three task complexity levels demonstrate that DART-LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming the baseline across all evaluation metrics. Among the tested models, DeepSeek-r1-671B achieves the highest success rate, whereas Llama-3.1-8B exhibits superior response time reliability. Ablation studies further confirm that explicit dependency modeling notably enhances the performance of smaller models, facilitating efficient deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Existing methods typically formulate the detection paradigm as a label-based semantic segmentation task. This paradigm relies on predefined labels and lacks the ability to comprehend complex natural language, resulting in limited generalization in open-world scene. To address these limitations, we reformulate the traditional affordance detection paradigm into \textit{Instruction Reasoning Affordance Segmentation} (IRAS) task. This task is designed to output a affordance mask region given a query reasoning text, which avoids fixed categories of input labels. We accordingly propose the \textit{3D-AffordanceLLM} (3D-ADLLM), a framework designed for reasoning affordance detection in 3D open-scene. Specifically, 3D-ADLLM introduces large language models (LLMs) to 3D affordance perception with a custom-designed decoder for generating affordance masks, thus achieving open-world reasoning affordance detection. In addition, given the scarcity of 3D affordance datasets for training large models, we seek to extract knowledge from general segmentation data and transfer it to affordance detection. Thus, we propose a multi-stage training strategy that begins with a novel pre-training task, i.e., \textit{Referring Object Part Segmentation}~(ROPS). This stage is designed to equip the model with general recognition and segmentation capabilities at the object-part level. Then followed by fine-tuning with the IRAS task, 3D-ADLLM obtains the reasoning ability for affordance detection. In summary, 3D-ADLLM leverages the rich world knowledge and human-object interaction reasoning ability of LLMs, achieving approximately an 8\% improvement in mIoU on open-vocabulary affordance detection tasks.</p></details> | ICLR |
| **[SeqAfford: Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning via Multimodal Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01550v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D affordance segmentation aims to link human instructions to touchable regions of 3D objects for embodied manipulations. Existing efforts typically adhere to single-object, single-affordance paradigms, where each affordance type or explicit instruction strictly corresponds to a specific affordance region and are unable to handle long-horizon tasks. Such a paradigm cannot actively reason about complex user intentions that often imply sequential affordances. In this paper, we introduce the Sequential 3D Affordance Reasoning task, which extends the traditional paradigm by reasoning from cumbersome user intentions and then decomposing them into a series of segmentation maps. Toward this, we construct the first instruction-based affordance segmentation benchmark that includes reasoning over both single and sequential affordances, comprising 180K instruction-point cloud pairs. Based on the benchmark, we propose our model, SeqAfford, to unlock the 3D multi-modal large language model with additional affordance segmentation abilities, which ensures reasoning with world knowledge and fine-grained affordance grounding in a cohesive framework. We further introduce a multi-granular language-point integration module to endow 3D dense prediction. Extensive experimental evaluations show that our model excels over well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization with sequential reasoning abilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Add-One-In: Incremental Sample Selection for Large Language Models via a Choice-Based Greedy Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02359v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Selecting high-quality and diverse training samples from extensive datasets plays a crucial role in reducing training overhead and enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies fall short in assessing the overall value of selected data, focusing primarily on individual quality, and struggle to strike an effective balance between ensuring diversity and minimizing data point traversals. Therefore, this paper introduces a novel choice-based sample selection framework that shifts the focus from evaluating individual sample quality to comparing the contribution value of different samples when incorporated into the subset. Thanks to the advanced language understanding capabilities of LLMs, we utilize LLMs to evaluate the value of each option during the selection process. Furthermore, we design a greedy sampling process where samples are incrementally added to the subset, thereby improving efficiency by eliminating the need for exhaustive traversal of the entire dataset with the limited budget. Extensive experiments demonstrate that selected data from our method not only surpass the performance of the full dataset but also achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art (SOTA) studies, while requiring fewer selections. Moreover, we validate our approach on a larger medical dataset, highlighting its practical applicability in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing evaluation methods for LVLMs, primarily based on benchmarks like Visual Question Answering and image captioning, often fail to capture the full scope of LVLMs' capabilities. These benchmarks are limited by issues such as inadequate assessment of detailed visual perception, data contamination, and a lack of focus on multi-turn reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose \method{}, a game-based evaluation framework designed to provide a comprehensive assessment of LVLMs' cognitive and reasoning skills in structured environments. \method{} uses a set of games to evaluate LVLMs on four core tasks: Perceiving, Question Answering, Rule Following, and End-to-End Playing, with each target task designed to assess specific abilities, including visual perception, reasoning, decision-making, etc. Based on this framework, we conduct extensive experiments that explore the limitations of current LVLMs, such as handling long structured outputs and perceiving detailed and dense elements.

However, the capabilities of these models in languages such as Danish were, until recently, difficult to verify beyond qualitative demonstrations due to a lack of applicable evaluation corpora. We present a GLLM benchmark to evaluate \emph{Danoliteracy}, a measure of Danish language and cultural competency across eight diverse scenarios such as Danish citizenship tests and abstractive social media question answering. This limited-size benchmark was found to produce a robust ranking that correlates to human feedback at $\rho \sim 0.8$ with GPT-4 and Claude Opus models achieving the highest rankings. Analyzing these model results across scenarios, we find one strong underlying factor explaining $95\%$ of scenario performance variance for GLLMs in Danish, suggesting a $g$ factor of model consistency in language adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, Accepted to NoDaLiDa/Baltic-HLT 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Exact Match: Semantically Reassessing Event Extraction by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09418v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event extraction has gained extensive research attention due to its broad range of applications. However, the current mainstream evaluation method for event extraction relies on token-level exact match, which misjudges numerous semantic-level correct cases. This reliance leads to a significant discrepancy between the evaluated performance of models under exact match criteria and their real performance. To address this problem, we propose a reliable and semantic evaluation framework for event extraction, named RAEE, which accurately assesses extraction results at semantic-level instead of token-level. Specifically, RAEE leverages large language models (LLMs) as evaluation agents, incorporating an adaptive mechanism to achieve adaptive evaluations for precision and recall of triggers and arguments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) RAEE achieves a very strong correlation with human judgments; (2) after reassessing 14 models, including advanced LLMs, on 10 datasets, there is a significant performance gap between exact match and RAEE. The exact match evaluation significantly underestimates the performance of existing event extraction models, and in particular underestimates the capabilities of LLMs; (3) fine-grained analysis under RAEE evaluation reveals insightful phenomena worth further exploration. The evaluation toolkit of our proposed RAEE is publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crosslingual Capabilities and Knowledge Barriers in Multilingual Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16135v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are typically multilingual due to pretraining on diverse multilingual corpora. But can these models relate corresponding concepts across languages, i.e., be crosslingual? This study evaluates state-of-the-art LLMs on inherently crosslingual tasks. We observe that while these models show promising surface-level crosslingual abilities on machine translation and embedding space analyses, they struggle with deeper crosslingual knowledge transfer, revealing a crosslingual knowledge barrier in both general (MMLU benchmark) and domain-specific (Harry Potter quiz and TOFU benchmark) contexts. Since simple inference-time mitigation methods offer only limited improvement, we propose fine-tuning of LLMs on mixed-language data, which effectively reduces these gaps, even when using out-of-domain datasets like WikiText. Our findings suggest the need for explicit optimization to unlock the full crosslingual potential of LLMs. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/google-research/crosslingual-knowledge-barriers.</p></details> |  |
| **[SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition with Uninterrupted Retention and Low-Rank Adaptation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18168v4)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), fully fine-tuning (FT) these models is becoming increasingly infeasible due to high computational demands. Moreover, FT also increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting. As an alternative, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has been proposed. By fine-tuning only a small subset of parameters, LoRA achieves performance similar to FT while significantly reducing resource requirements. However, since LoRA inherits FT's design, the issue of catastrophic forgetting still remains. To address these limitations, we propose SECURA: Sigmoid-Enhanced CUR Decomposition LoRA, a novel PEFT variant designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting while improving fine-tuning performance. Our method introduces a novel normalization technique, Sigmoid-based Magnitude Norm (S-MagNorm), which enhances parameter retention and fine-tuning efficiency. SECURA has been evaluated on a diverse range of tasks, including mathematical problem-solving (GSM8K), complex question-answering (CNNDM), translation (NewsDE), and complex multiple-choice reasoning (LogiQA). Experimental results demonstrate that it achieves an average fine-tuning improvement of 3.59% across four MCQ tasks and 2.51% across five QA tasks on Gemma2 2B, Qwen2 1.5B, Qwen2 7B, Llama3 8B, and Llama3.1 8B, outperforming DoRA. Additionally, SECURA demonstrates superior knowledge retention capabilities, achieving state-of-the-art performance in 16 continual learning tests and maintaining more than 70% accuracy on LLMs' basic knowledge compared to Experience Replay (ER), sequential learning (SEQ), EWC, I-LoRA, and CUR-LoRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>New w...</summary><p>New work on PEFT for LLMs, introducing S-MagNorm and CABR-LoRA to enhance fine-tuning performance and knowledge retention.

The performance of NL2SQL has been greatly enhanced with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of NL2SQL techniques powered by LLMs, covering its entire lifecycle from the following four aspects: (1) Model: NL2SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and under-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and instances; (2) Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due to training data scarcity, to NL2SQL benchmarks; (3) Evaluation: Evaluating NL2SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities; and (4) Error Analysis: analyzing NL2SQL errors to find the root cause and guiding NL2SQL models to evolve. Moreover, we provide a rule of thumb for developing NL2SQL solutions.

However, the scarcity of sufficiently challenging problems, particularly at the Olympiad level, hinders further advancements. In this work, we introduce PromptCoT, a novel approach for automatically generating high-quality Olympiad-level math problems. The proposed method synthesizes complex problems based on mathematical concepts and the rationale behind problem construction, emulating the thought processes of experienced problem designers. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that an optimal rationale should maximize both the likelihood of rationale generation given the associated concepts and the likelihood of problem generation conditioned on both the rationale and the concepts. Our method is evaluated on standard benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH-500, and AIME2024, where it consistently outperforms existing problem generation methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PromptCoT exhibits superior data scalability, consistently maintaining high performance as the dataset size increases, outperforming the baselines.

However, they are constrained by the maximum length of input tokens, making it impractical to input entire videos. Existing frame selection approaches, such as uniform frame sampling and text-frame retrieval, fail to account for the information density variations in the videos or the complex instructions in the tasks, leading to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose Frame-Voyager that learns to query informative frame combinations, based on the given textual queries in the task. To train Frame-Voyager, we introduce a new data collection and labeling pipeline, by ranking frame combinations using a pre-trained Video-LLM. Given a video of M frames, we traverse its T-frame combinations, feed them into a Video-LLM, and rank them based on Video-LLM's prediction losses. Using this ranking as supervision, we train Frame-Voyager to query the frame combinations with lower losses. In experiments, we evaluate Frame-Voyager on four Video Question Answering benchmarks by plugging it into two different Video-LLMs. The experimental results demonstrate that Frame-Voyager achieves impressive results in all settings, highlighting its potential as a plug-and-play solution for Video-LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025, Camera-ready Version</p></details> |
| **[On Memorization of Large Language Models in Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23123v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve good performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks, yet could also make basic reasoning mistakes. This contrasting behavior is puzzling when it comes to understanding the mechanisms behind LLMs' reasoning capabilities. One hypothesis is that the increasingly high and nearly saturated performance on common reasoning benchmarks could be due to the memorization of similar problems. In this paper, we systematically investigate this hypothesis with a quantitative measurement of memorization in reasoning tasks, using a dynamically generated logical reasoning benchmark based on Knights and Knaves (K&K) puzzles. We find that LLMs could interpolate and memorize the training puzzles (achieving near-perfect accuracy) after fine-tuning, yet they struggle with slight variations of these puzzles. On the other hand, we show that while fine-tuning leads to heavy memorization, it also consistently improves generalization performance. Through in-depth analyses with perturbation tests, cross difficulty-level transferability, probing model internals, and fine-tuning with wrong answers, we establish that LLMs develop reasoning skills on K&K puzzles alongside memorization. Finally, our analysis based on a per-sample memorization score sheds light on how LLMs switch between reasoning and memorization when solving logical puzzles.

However, the current doctor recommendation systems fail to fully ensure the professionalism and interpretability of the recommended results. In this work, we formulate doctor recommendation as a ranking task and develop a large language model (LLM)-based pointwise ranking framework. Our framework ranks doctors according to their relevance regarding specific diseases-treatment pairs in a zero-shot setting. The advantage of our framework lies in its ability to generate precise and explainable doctor ranking results. Additionally, we construct DrRank, a new expertise-driven doctor ranking dataset comprising over 38 disease-treatment pairs. Experiment results on the DrRank dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms the strongest cross-encoder baseline, achieving a notable gain of +5.45 in the NDCG@10 score while maintaining affordable latency consumption. Furthermore, we comprehensively present the fairness analysis results of our framework from three perspectives of different diseases, patient gender, and geographical regions. Meanwhile, the interpretability of our framework is rigorously verified by three human experts, providing further evidence of the reliability of our proposed framework for doctor recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics (JBHI) under review</p></details> |

A "visual analogy" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 4,300 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children (ages three to five) and to adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while GPT-o1, GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the "what" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the "how" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-o1, performs better in tasks involving simple surface-level visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of extrinsic spatial properties in the physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages.

| **[TPIA: Towards Target-specific Prompt Injection Attack against Code-oriented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v5)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully exploited to simplify and facilitate programming. Unfortunately, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former poisons the training data or model parameters, hijacking the LLMs to generate malicious code snippets when encountering the trigger. The latter crafts malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of the generated codes. In this paper, we reveal that both attacks have some inherent limitations: backdoor attacks rely on the adversary's capability of controlling the model training process, which may not be practical; adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents a novel attack paradigm against Code LLMs, namely target-specific prompt injection attack (TPIA). TPIA generates non-functional perturbations containing the information of malicious instructions and inserts them into the victim's code context by spreading them into potentially used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base). It induces the Code LLMs to generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at the target location. In general, we compress the attacker-specified malicious objective into the perturbation by adversarial optimization based on greedy token search. We collect 13 representative malicious objectives to design 31 threat cases for three popular programming languages. We show that our TPIA can successfully attack three representative open-source Code LLMs (with an attack success rate of up to 97.9%) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with an attack success rate of over 90%) in all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional perturbation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Help Experimental Design for Causal Discovery?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01139v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing proper experiments and selecting optimal intervention targets is a longstanding problem in scientific or causal discovery. Identifying the underlying causal structure from observational data alone is inherently difficult. Obtaining interventional data, on the other hand, is crucial to causal discovery, yet it is usually expensive and time-consuming to gather sufficient interventional data to facilitate causal discovery. Previous approaches commonly utilize uncertainty or gradient signals to determine the intervention targets. However, numerical-based approaches may yield suboptimal results due to the inaccurate estimation of the guiding signals at the beginning when with limited interventional data. In this work, we investigate a different approach, whether we can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to assist with the intervention targeting in causal discovery by making use of the rich world knowledge about the experimental design in LLMs. Specifically, we present Large Language Model Guided Intervention Targeting (LeGIT) -- a robust framework that effectively incorporates LLMs to augment existing numerical approaches for the intervention targeting in causal discovery. Across 4 realistic benchmark scales, LeGIT demonstrates significant improvements and robustness over existing methods and even surpasses humans, which demonstrates the usefulness of LLMs in assisting with experimental design for scientific discovery.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning abilities, their capacity to learn and apply embodied design principles--crucial for creating functional robotic systems--remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces RoboCrafter-QA, a novel benchmark to evaluate whether LLMs can learn representations of soft robot designs that effectively bridge the gap between high-level task descriptions and low-level morphological and material choices. RoboCrafter-QA leverages the EvoGym simulator to generate a diverse set of soft robot design challenges, spanning robotic locomotion, manipulation, and balancing tasks. Our experiments with state-of-the-art multi-modal LLMs reveal that while these models exhibit promising capabilities in learning design representations, they struggle with fine-grained distinctions between designs with subtle performance differences. We further demonstrate the practical utility of LLMs for robot design initialization. Our code and benchmark will be available to encourage the community to foster this exciting research direction.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first propose to deploy the LoRA-finetuned LLMs on the hybrid compute-in-memory (CIM) architecture (i.e., pretrained weights onto RRAM and LoRA onto SRAM). To address performance degradation from RRAM's inherent noise, we design a novel Hardware-aware Low-rank Adaption (HaLoRA) method, aiming to train a LoRA branch that is both robust and accurate by aligning the training objectives under both ideal and noisy conditions. Experiments finetuning LLaMA 3.2 1B and 3B demonstrate HaLoRA's effectiveness across multiple reasoning tasks, achieving up to 22.7 improvement in average score while maintaining robustness at various noise levels.</p></details> | 7 pages |

However, accurately representing surfaces, especially in large and complex scenarios, remains a significant challenge due to the unstructured nature of 3DGS. In this paper, we present CityGaussianV2, a novel approach for large-scale scene reconstruction that addresses critical challenges related to geometric accuracy and efficiency. Building on the favorable generalization capabilities of 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), we address its convergence and scalability issues. Specifically, we implement a decomposed-gradient-based densification and depth regression technique to eliminate blurry artifacts and accelerate convergence. To scale up, we introduce an elongation filter that mitigates Gaussian count explosion caused by 2DGS degeneration. Furthermore, we optimize the CityGaussian pipeline for parallel training, achieving up to 10$\times$ compression, at least 25% savings in training time, and a 50% decrease in memory usage. We also established standard geometry benchmarks under large-scale scenes. Experimental results demonstrate that our method strikes a promising balance between visual quality, geometric accuracy, as well as storage and training costs.

LMMs encode both text and visual data into tokens that are then combined and processed by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). Including visual tokens substantially increases the total token count, often by thousands. The increased input length for LLM significantly raises the complexity of inference, resulting in high latency in LMMs. To address this issue, token pruning methods, which remove part of the visual tokens, are proposed. The existing token pruning methods either require extensive calibration and fine-tuning or rely on suboptimal importance metrics which results in increased redundancy among the retained tokens. In this paper, we first formulate token pruning as Max-Min Diversity Problem (MMDP) where the goal is to select a subset such that the diversity among the selected {tokens} is maximized. Then, we solve the MMDP to obtain the selected subset and prune the rest. The proposed method, DivPrune, reduces redundancy and achieves the highest diversity of the selected tokens. By ensuring high diversity, the selected tokens better represent the original tokens, enabling effective performance even at high pruning ratios without requiring fine-tuning. Extensive experiments with various LMMs show that DivPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy over 16 image- and video-language datasets. Additionally, DivPrune reduces both the end-to-end latency and GPU memory usage for the tested models. The code is available $\href{https://github.com/vbdi/divprune}{\text{here}}$.</p></details> |  |

By integrating real-time data with computational models, digital twins enable continuous monitoring, simulation, prediction, and optimization, effectively bridging the gap between the physical and digital worlds. Recent advancements in communication, computing, and control technologies have accelerated the development and adoption of digital twins across various industries. However, significant challenges remain, including limited data for accurate system modeling, inefficiencies in system analysis, and a lack of explainability in the interactions between physical and digital systems. The rise of large language models (LLMs) offers new avenues to address these challenges. LLMs have shown exceptional capabilities across diverse domains, exhibiting strong generalization and emergent abilities that hold great potential for enhancing digital twins. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent developments in LLMs and their applications to digital twin modeling. We propose a unified description-prediction-prescription framework to integrate digital twin modeling technologies and introduce a structured taxonomy to categorize LLM functionalities in these contexts. For each stage of application, we summarize the methodologies, identify key challenges, and explore potential future directions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-enhanced digital twins, we present an LLM-enhanced enterprise digital twin system, which enables automatic modeling and optimization of an enterprise.

Existing benchmarks fail to effectively evaluate hallucinations based on their underlying causes and lack assessments of mitigation strategies. To address this gap, we introduce MedHEval, a novel benchmark that systematically evaluates hallucinations and mitigation strategies in Med-LVLMs by categorizing them into three underlying causes: visual misinterpretation, knowledge deficiency, and context misalignment. We construct a diverse set of close- and open-ended medical VQA datasets with comprehensive evaluation metrics to assess these hallucination types. We conduct extensive experiments across 11 popular (Med)-LVLMs and evaluate 7 state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation techniques. Results reveal that Med-LVLMs struggle with hallucinations arising from different causes while existing mitigation methods show limited effectiveness, especially for knowledge- and context-based errors. These findings underscore the need for improved alignment training and specialized mitigation strategies to enhance Med-LVLMs' reliability. MedHEval establishes a standardized framework for evaluating and mitigating medical hallucinations, guiding the development of more trustworthy Med-LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |

We collected a comprehensive dataset from Arbor Edge Defender (AED) devices, comprising of 30,959 observations and 19 features. Multiple models were evaluated, including Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Transformer, and two Large Language Models (LLMs) including GPT-4o and Gemini with zero- and few-shot learning. Transformer and XGBoost showed the best performance, achieving the highest accuracy of 98.95 and 97.56%, respectively. GPT-4o and Gemini showed promising results with few-shot learning, improving accuracy significantly from initial zero-shot performance. While Gemini Few-Shot and GPT-4o Few-Shot performed well in categories like Web and Email, misclassifications occurred in more complex categories like IPSec and Backup. The study highlights the importance of model selection, fine-tuning, and the balance between training data size and model complexity for achieving reliable classification results.</p></details> |  |
| **[TMIQ: Quantifying Test and Measurement Domain Intelligence in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02123v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Test and Measurement domain, known for its strict requirements for accuracy and efficiency, is increasingly adopting Generative AI technologies to enhance the performance of data analysis, automation, and decision-making processes. Among these, Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise for advancing automation and precision in testing. However, the evaluation of LLMs in this specialized area remains insufficiently explored. To address this gap, we introduce the Test and Measurement Intelligence Quotient (TMIQ), a benchmark designed to quantitatively assess LLMs across a wide range of electronic engineering tasks. TMIQ offers a comprehensive set of scenarios and metrics for detailed evaluation, including SCPI command matching accuracy, ranked response evaluation, Chain-of-Thought Reasoning (CoT), and the impact of output formatting variations required by LLMs on performance. In testing various LLMs, our findings indicate varying levels of proficiency, with exact SCPI command match accuracy ranging from around 56% to 73%, and ranked matching first-position scores achieving around 33% for the best-performing model. We also assess token usage, cost-efficiency, and response times, identifying trade-offs between accuracy and operational efficiency. Additionally, we present a command-line interface (CLI) tool that enables users to generate datasets using the same methodology, allowing for tailored assessments of LLMs. TMIQ and the CLI tool provide a rigorous, reproducible means of evaluating LLMs for production environments, facilitating continuous monitoring and identifying strengths and areas for improvement, and driving innovation in their selections for applications within the Test and Measurement industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in IEEE I2MTC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Graph sub-sampling for divide-and-conquer algorithms in large networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06994v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As networks continue to increase in size, current methods must be capable of handling large numbers of nodes and edges in order to be practically relevant. Instead of working directly with the entire (large) network, analyzing sub-networks has become a popular approach. Due to a network's inherent inter-connectedness, however, sub-sampling is not a trivial task. While this problem has gained popularity in recent years, it has not received sufficient attention from the statistics community. In this work, we provide a thorough comparison of seven graph sub-sampling algorithms by applying them to divide-and-conquer algorithms for community structure and core-periphery (CP) structure. After discussing the various algorithms and sub-sampling routines, we derive theoretical results for the mis-classification rate of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for CP structure under various sub-sampling schemes. We then perform extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data to compare the various methods. For the community detection task, we found that sampling nodes uniformly at random yields the best performance, but that sometimes the base algorithm applied to the entire network yields better results both in terms of identification and computational time. For CP structure on the other hand, there was no single winner, but algorithms which sampled core nodes at a higher rate consistently outperformed other sampling routines, e.g., random edge sampling and random walk sampling. Unlike community detection, the CP divide-and-conquer algorithm tends to yield better identification results while also being faster than the base algorithm. The varying performance of the sampling algorithms on different tasks demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting a sub-sampling routine for the specific application.</p></details> |  |

This automation is not perfect, however, and the solver often requires hints in the form of assertions, creating a burden for the proof engineer. In this paper, we propose Laurel, a tool that alleviates this burden by automatically generating assertions using large language models (LLMs). To improve the success rate of LLMs in this task, we design two domain-specific prompting techniques. First, we help the LLM determine the location of the missing assertion by analyzing the verifier's error message and inserting an assertion placeholder at that location. Second, we provide the LLM with example assertions from the same codebase, which we select based on a new proof similarity metric. We evaluate our techniques on our new benchmark DafnyGym, a dataset of complex lemmas we extracted from three real-world Dafny codebases. Our evaluation shows that Laurel is able to generate over 56.6\% of the required assertions given only a few attempts, making LLMs an affordable tool for unblocking program verifiers without human intervention.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, accepted at OOPSLA 25</p></details> |

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Industrial Track as Oral Presentation</p></details> |
| **[Linear Representations of Political Perspective Emerge in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02080v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to generate text that realistically reflects a range of different subjective human perspectives. This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus more conservative viewpoints among other political perspectives in American politics. We show that LLMs possess linear representations of political perspectives within activation space, wherein more similar perspectives are represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (\texttt{Llama-2-7b-chat}, \texttt{Mistral-7b-instruct}, \texttt{Vicuna-7b}). We first prompt models to generate text from the perspectives of different U.S.~lawmakers. We then identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of American political ideology and that by leveraging recent advances in mechanistic interpretability, we can identify, monitor, and steer the subjective perspective underlying generated text.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Our approach leverages LLM reasoning ability to generate appropriate parameters for sigmoid-based boundary functions that define safe corridors around obstacles, effectively reducing the state-space of the controlled vehicle. The proposed framework adjusts these boundaries dynamically based on real-time vehicle data that guarantees collision-free trajectories while also ensuring both computational efficiency and trajectory optimality. The problem is formulated as an optimal control problem and solved with differential dynamic programming (DDP) for constrained optimization, and the proposed approach is embedded within an MPC framework. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance in maintaining safety and efficiency in complex, dynamic environments compared to a baseline MPC approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpolation Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD): a scalable and interpretable approach for large-scale physics-based problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02041v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been extensively employed as a powerful function approximator for modeling physics-based problems described by partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite their popularity, standard deep learning models often demand prohibitively large computational resources and yield limited accuracy when scaling to large-scale, high-dimensional physical problems. Their black-box nature further hinders the application in industrial problems where interpretability and high precision are critical. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces Interpolation Neural Network-Tensor Decomposition (INN-TD), a scalable and interpretable framework that has the merits of both machine learning and finite element methods for modeling large-scale physical systems. By integrating locally supported interpolation functions from finite element into the network architecture, INN-TD achieves a sparse learning structure with enhanced accuracy, faster training/solving speed, and reduced memory footprint. This makes it particularly effective for tackling large-scale high-dimensional parametric PDEs in training, solving, and inverse optimization tasks in physical problems where high precision is required.</p></details> |  |

To harness the power of this vast transportation data, various machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods have been introduced to address numerous transportation challenges. However, these methods often require significant investment in data collection, processing, storage, and the employment of professionals with expertise in transportation and ML. Additionally, privacy issues are a major concern when processing data for real-world traffic control and management. To address these challenges, the research team proposes an innovative Multi-agent framework named Independent Mobility GPT (IDM-GPT) based on large language models (LLMs) for customized traffic analysis, management suggestions, and privacy preservation. IDM-GPT efficiently connects users, transportation databases, and ML models economically. IDM-GPT trains, customizes, and applies various LLM-based AI agents for multiple functions, including user query comprehension, prompts optimization, data analysis, model selection, and performance evaluation and enhancement. With IDM-GPT, users without any background in transportation or ML can efficiently and intuitively obtain data analysis and customized suggestions in near real-time based on their questions. Experimental results demonstrate that IDM-GPT delivers satisfactory performance across multiple traffic-related tasks, providing comprehensive and actionable insights that support effective traffic management and urban mobility improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, TRR accepted</p></details> |

Recently, direct evaluation methods have emerged, examining open-ended model responses to overcome limitations of previous approaches, such as annotator biases.Most existing studies have focused on English-centric LLMs, whereas research on non-English models--particularly Japanese--remains sparse, despite the growing development and adoption of these models.This study examines the safety of Japanese LLMs when responding to stereotype-triggering prompts in direct setups.We constructed 3,612 prompts by combining 301 social group terms--categorized by age, gender, and other attributes--with 12 stereotype-inducing templates in Japanese.Responses were analyzed from three foundational models trained respectively on Japanese, English, and Chinese language.Our findings reveal that LLM-jp, a Japanese native model, exhibits the lowest refusal rate and is more likely to generate toxic and negative responses compared to other models.Additionally, prompt format significantly influence the output of all models, and the generated responses include exaggerated reactions toward specific social groups, varying across models.These findings underscore the insufficient ethical safety mechanisms in Japanese LLMs and demonstrate that even high-accuracy models can produce biased outputs when processing Japanese-language prompts.We advocate for improving safety mechanisms and bias mitigation strategies in Japanese LLMs, contributing to ongoing discussions on AI ethics beyond linguistic boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence for possible publication</p></details> |

To address this issue, safety filters are often added on top of text-to-image models, or the models themselves are aligned to reduce harmful outputs. However, these defenses remain vulnerable when an attacker strategically designs adversarial prompts to bypass these safety guardrails. In this work, we propose PromptTune, a method to jailbreak text-to-image models with safety guardrails using a fine-tuned large language model. Unlike other query-based jailbreak attacks that require repeated queries to the target model, our attack generates adversarial prompts efficiently after fine-tuning our AttackLLM. We evaluate our method on three datasets of unsafe prompts and against five safety guardrails. Our results demonstrate that our approach effectively bypasses safety guardrails, outperforms existing no-box attacks, and also facilitates other query-based attacks.</p></details> |  |

Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE), which encode relative position by rotating queries and keys, have become widely used in modern LLMs. We study the features and patterns that emerge in queries and keys when using rotary embeddings. Our analysis reveals consistent patterns within the same model across layers and attention heads and across different models and architectures. We present and apply analysis techniques and show how the queries and keys use RoPE to construct various attention patterns, including attention sinks. We find and analyze outliers across models in queries and keys and find that they are likely to be found in rotary features with partial cycles. We derive bounds that tell us what rotary frequencies are likely to be selected as outlier features and at what minimum angle the query-key rotary pairs in these features tend to be above and verify the bounds empirically with models of significant architectural differences.</p></details> |  |

While these capabilities can be used for social good, they also present risks of potential misuse. Moreover, LLMs' susceptibility to persuasion raises concerns about alignment with ethical principles. To study these dynamics, we introduce Persuade Me If You Can (PMIYC), an automated framework for evaluating persuasion through multi-agent interactions. Here, Persuader agents engage in multi-turn conversations with the Persuadee agents, allowing us to measure LLMs' persuasive effectiveness and their susceptibility to persuasion. We conduct comprehensive evaluations across diverse LLMs, ensuring each model is assessed against others in both subjective and misinformation contexts. We validate the efficacy of our framework through human evaluations and show alignment with prior work. PMIYC offers a scalable alternative to human annotation for studying persuasion in LLMs. Through PMIYC, we find that Llama-3.3-70B and GPT-4o exhibit similar persuasive effectiveness, outperforming Claude 3 Haiku by 30%. However, GPT-4o demonstrates over 50% greater resistance to persuasion for misinformation compared to Llama-3.3-70B. These findings provide empirical insights into the persuasive dynamics of LLMs and contribute to the development of safer AI systems.</p></details> |  |

Shortcuts are non-relevant patterns in data, such as the background color or color intensity. So, to ensure the robustness of deep learning applications, there is a need for methods to detect and remove such shortcuts. Today's model debugging methods are time consuming since they often require customization to fit for a given model architecture in a specific domain. We propose a generalized, model-agnostic framework to debug deep learning models. We focus on the domain of histopathology, which has very large images that require large models - and therefore large computation resources. It can be run on a workstation with a commodity GPU. We demonstrate that our framework can replicate non-image shortcuts that have been found in previous work for self-supervised learning models, and we also identify possible shortcuts in a foundation model. Our easy to use tests contribute to the development of more reliable, accurate, and generalizable models for WSI analysis. Our framework is available as an open-source tool available on github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Smaller Large Language Models Can Do Moral Self-Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23496v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-correction is one of the most amazing emerging capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), enabling LLMs to self-modify an inappropriate output given a natural language feedback which describes the problems of that output. Moral self-correction is a post-hoc approach correcting unethical generations without requiring a gradient update, making it both computationally lightweight and capable of preserving the language modeling ability. Previous works have shown that LLMs can self-debias, and it has been reported that small models, i.e., those with less than 22B parameters, are not capable of moral self-correction. However, there is no direct proof as to why such smaller models fall short of moral self-correction, though previous research hypothesizes that larger models are skilled in following instructions and understanding abstract social norms. In this paper, we empirically validate this hypothesis in the context of social stereotyping, through meticulous prompting. Our experimental results indicate that (i) surprisingly, 3.8B LLMs with proper safety alignment fine-tuning can achieve very good moral self-correction performance, highlighting the significant effects of safety alignment; and (ii) small LLMs are indeed weaker than larger-scale models in terms of comprehending social norms and self-explanation through CoT, but all scales of LLMs show bad self-correction performance given unethical instructions.</p></details> |  |

However, they continue to struggle in cold-start and data-sparse scenarios. The emergence of large language models (LLMs) like GPT and LLaMA presents new possibilities for enhancing recommendation performance, especially in cold-start settings. Despite their promise, LLMs pose challenges related to scalability and efficiency due to their high computational demands and limited ability to model complex user-item relationships effectively. In this work, we introduce a novel perspective on leveraging LLMs for CF model initialization. Through experiments, we uncover an embedding collapse issue when scaling CF models to larger embedding dimensions. To effectively harness large-scale LLM embeddings, we propose innovative selective initialization strategies utilizing random, uniform, and variance-based index sampling. Our comprehensive evaluation on multiple real-world datasets demonstrates significant performance gains across various CF models while maintaining a lower computational cost compared to existing LLM-based recommendation approaches.</p></details> |  |

Due to the limited context length of tool-using LLMs, adopting information retrieval (IR) models to select useful tools from large toolsets is a critical initial step. However, the performance of IR models in tool retrieval tasks remains underexplored and unclear. Most tool-use benchmarks simplify this step by manually pre-annotating a small set of relevant tools for each task, which is far from the real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose ToolRet, a heterogeneous tool retrieval benchmark comprising 7.6k diverse retrieval tasks, and a corpus of 43k tools, collected from existing datasets. We benchmark six types of models on ToolRet. Surprisingly, even the models with strong performance in conventional IR benchmarks, exhibit poor performance on ToolRet. This low retrieval quality degrades the task pass rate of tool-use LLMs. As a further step, we contribute a large-scale training dataset with over 200k instances, which substantially optimizes the tool retrieval ability of IR models.</p></details> |  |

The toolkit aims to provide a user-friendly and comprehensive framework for researchers and developers to evaluate existing multi-modality models and publish reproducible evaluation results. In VLMEvalKit, we implement over 70 different large multi-modality models, including both proprietary APIs and open-source models, as well as more than 20 different multi-modal benchmarks. By implementing a single interface, new models can be easily added to the toolkit, while the toolkit automatically handles the remaining workloads, including data preparation, distributed inference, prediction post-processing, and metric calculation. Although the toolkit is currently mainly used for evaluating large vision-language models, its design is compatible with future updates that incorporate additional modalities, such as audio and video. Based on the evaluation results obtained with the toolkit, we host OpenVLM Leaderboard, a comprehensive leaderboard to track the progress of multi-modality learning research.

While much research has proposed methods for defending LLM systems against misuse by malicious actors, researchers have recently complemented these efforts with an offensive approach that involves red teaming, i.e., proactively attacking LLMs with the purpose of identifying their vulnerabilities. This paper provides a concise and practical overview of the LLM red teaming literature, structured so as to describe a multi-component system end-to-end. To motivate red teaming we survey the initial safety needs of some high-profile LLMs, and then dive into the different components of a red teaming system as well as software packages for implementing them. We cover various attack methods, strategies for attack-success evaluation, metrics for assessing experiment outcomes, as well as a host of other considerations. Our survey will be useful for any reader who wants to rapidly obtain a grasp of the major red teaming concepts for their own use in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the relationship between capabilities in different languages is less explored. In this work, we decompose the process of reasoning tasks into two separated components: knowledge retrieval and knowledge-free reasoning, and analyze the relationship between cross-lingual transferability and these two components. With adapted commonsense reasoning datasets and constructed knowledge-free reasoning datasets, we show that the knowledge-free reasoning capability can be nearly perfectly transferred across various source-target language directions despite the secondary impact of resource in some specific target languages, while cross-lingual knowledge retrieval significantly hinders the transfer. Moreover, by analyzing the hidden states and feed-forward network neuron activation during the reasoning, we show that higher similarity of hidden representations and larger overlap of activated neurons could explain the better cross-lingual transferability of knowledge-free reasoning than knowledge retrieval. Thus, we hypothesize that knowledge-free reasoning shares similar neurons in different languages for reasoning, while knowledge is stored separately in different languages. Our code and data is available at: https://github.com/NJUNLP/Knowledge-Free-Reasoning.</p></details> |  |

They allow the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to automatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language, which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into simulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like the commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this gap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned to translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-, and memory efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation model in up to 84.5% of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study demonstrates the model's practical potential for one-time generation as well as interactive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form, the fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that higher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and open-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In political science, these datasets are often generated through human annotation or supervised machine learning applied to evolving corpora. However, as semantic contexts shift over time, inferring dynamic interaction types on emerging issues among a diverse set of entities poses significant challenges, particularly in maintaining timely and consistent annotations. This paper presents the Expert-Augmented LLM Annotation (EALA) approach, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) in combination with historically annotated data and expert-constructed codebooks to extrapolate and extend datasets into future periods. We evaluate the performance and reliability of EALA using a dataset of climate negotiations. Our findings demonstrate that EALA effectively predicts nuanced interactions between negotiation parties and captures the evolution of topics over time. At the same time, we identify several limitations inherent to LLM-based annotation, highlighting areas for further improvement. Given the wide availability of codebooks and annotated datasets, EALA holds substantial promise for advancing research in political science and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress, presented at the 2025 Asian PolMeth Conference</p></details> |

Detecting these fingerprints is important for many reasons, among them protecting intellectual property, ensuring transparency regarding AI-generated content, and preventing the misuse of AI technologies. In this paper, we present a novel method to classify texts based on the stylistic fingerprints of the models that generated them. We introduce an LLM-detection ensemble that is composed of three classifiers with varied architectures and training data. This ensemble is trained to classify texts generated by four well-known LLM families: Claude, Gemini, Llama, and OpenAI. As this task is highly cost-sensitive and might have severe implications, we want to minimize false-positives and increase confidence. We consider a prediction as valid when all three classifiers in the ensemble unanimously agree on the output classification. Our ensemble is validated on a test set of texts generated by Claude, Gemini, Llama, and OpenAI models, and achieves extremely high precision (0.9988) and a very low false-positive rate (0.0004). Furthermore, we demonstrate the ensemble's ability to distinguish between texts generated by seen and unseen models. This reveals interesting stylistic relationships between models. This approach to stylistic analysis has implications for verifying the originality of AI-generated texts and tracking the origins of model training techniques.</p></details> |  |

The answer depends on your level of public recognition; however, if your information was available on a website, the answer is probably yes. All Large Language Models (LLMs) memorize training data to some extent. If an LLM training corpus includes personal data, it also memorizes personal data. Developing an LLM typically involves processing personal data, which falls directly within the scope of data protection laws. If a person is identified or identifiable, the implications are far-reaching: the AI system is subject to EU General Data Protection Regulation requirements even after the training phase is concluded. To back our arguments: (1.) We reiterate that LLMs output training data at inference time, be it verbatim or in generalized form. (2.) We show that some LLMs can thus be considered personal data on their own. This triggers a cascade of data protection implications such as data subject rights, including rights to access, rectification, or erasure. These rights extend to the information embedded with-in the AI model. (3.) This paper argues that machine learning researchers must acknowledge the legal implications of LLMs as personal data throughout the full ML development lifecycle, from data collection and curation to model provision on, e.g., GitHub or Hugging Face. (4.) We propose different ways for the ML research community to deal with these legal implications. Our paper serves as a starting point for improving the alignment between data protection law and the technical capabilities of LLMs. Our findings underscore the need for more interaction between the legal domain and the ML community.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, food is inextricably linked to people's lives, making it a vital research area for practical applications such as dietary management. Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, not only in their vast knowledge but also in their ability to handle languages naturally. While English is predominantly used, they can also support multiple languages including Japanese. This suggests that MLLMs are expected to significantly improve performance in food image understanding tasks. We fine-tuned open MLLMs LLaVA-1.5 and Phi-3 Vision on a Japanese recipe dataset and benchmarked their performance against the closed model GPT-4o. We then evaluated the content of generated recipes, including ingredients and cooking procedures, using 5,000 evaluation samples that comprehensively cover Japanese food culture. Our evaluation demonstrates that the open models trained on recipe data outperform GPT-4o, the current state-of-the-art model, in ingredient generation. Our model achieved F1 score of 0.531, surpassing GPT-4o's F1 score of 0.481, indicating a higher level of accuracy. Furthermore, our model exhibited comparable performance to GPT-4o in generating cooking procedure text.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via DPO: On-Policy Data Hold the Key](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09695v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hallucination remains a major challenge for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention as a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from constructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in responses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless, different data construction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We identify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the constructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO. Theoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by the presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference policy. From the perspective of dataset distribution, we systematically summarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address hallucination issues. To alleviate the problems, we propose On-Policy Alignment (OPA)-DPO framework, which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct hallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised responses in an on-policy manner. Notably, with only 4.8k data, OPA-DPO achieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of LLaVA-1.5-7B: 13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark, compared to the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/zhyang2226/OPA-DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, the generalizability of existing pruning methods across diverse datasets and tasks remains unclear. Thus, we conduct extensive evaluations on 24 datasets and 4 tasks using popular pruning methods. Based on these evaluations, we find and then investigate that calibration set greatly affect the performance of pruning methods. In addition, we surprisingly find a significant performance drop of existing pruning methods in sentiment classification tasks. To understand the link between performance drop and pruned neurons, we propose Neuron Semantic Attribution, which learns to associate each neuron with specific semantics. This method first makes the unpruned neurons of LLMs explainable.</p></details> |  |

However, it is still unclear whether LLMs can discover novel and valid hypotheses in chemistry. In this work, we investigate this central research question: Can LLMs automatically discover novel and valid chemistry research hypotheses given only a chemistry research background (consisting of a research question and/or a background survey), without limitation on the domain of the research question? After extensive discussions with chemistry experts, we propose an assumption that a majority of chemistry hypotheses can be resulted from a research background and several inspirations. With this key insight, we break the central question into three smaller fundamental questions. In brief, they are: (1) given a background question, whether LLMs can retrieve good inspirations; (2) with background and inspirations, whether LLMs can lead to hypothesis; and (3) whether LLMs can identify good hypotheses to rank them higher. To investigate these questions, we construct a benchmark consisting of 51 chemistry papers published in Nature, Science, or a similar level in 2024 (all papers are only available online since 2024). Every paper is divided by chemistry PhD students into three components: background, inspirations, and hypothesis. The goal is to rediscover the hypothesis, given only the background and a large randomly selected chemistry literature corpus consisting the ground truth inspiration papers, with LLMs trained with data up to 2023. We also develop an LLM-based multi-agent framework that leverages the assumption, consisting of three stages reflecting the three smaller questions. The proposed method can rediscover many hypotheses with very high similarity with the ground truth ones, covering the main innovations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Despite their demonstrated efficiency and performance, pretraining such non-standard architectures from scratch remains costly and risky. The linearization of large language models (LLMs) transforms pretrained standard models into linear recurrent structures, enabling more efficient deployment. However, current linearization methods typically introduce additional feature map modules that require extensive fine-tuning and overlook the gating mechanisms used in state-of-the-art linear recurrent models. To address these issues, this paper presents Liger, short for Linearizing LLMs to gated recurrent structures. Liger is a novel approach for converting pretrained LLMs into gated linear recurrent models without adding extra parameters. It repurposes the pretrained key matrix weights to construct diverse gating mechanisms, facilitating the formation of various gated recurrent structures while avoiding the need to train additional components from scratch. Using lightweight fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Liger restores the performance of the linearized gated recurrent models to match that of the original LLMs. Additionally, we introduce Liger Attention, an intra-layer hybrid attention mechanism, which significantly recovers 93\% of the Transformer-based LLM at 0.02\% pre-training tokens during the linearization process, achieving competitive results across multiple benchmarks, as validated on models ranging from 1B to 8B parameters.

| **[ANLS* -- A Universal Document Processing Metric for Generative Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03848v8)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditionally, discriminative models have been the predominant choice for tasks like document classification and information extraction. These models make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes, facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due to their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However, evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by GLLMs. This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets, and more than 20 different GLLMs together with 3 different prompting methods using the ANLS* metric is also provided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric. We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called SFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN. In almost all cases, SFT outperforms other techniques and improves the state-of-the-art, sometimes by as much as $10$ percentage points.

| **[Benchmarking Large Language Models for Multi-Language Software Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01449v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative AI have led to the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, addressing numerous long-standing challenges. However, a comprehensive study examining the capabilities of LLMs in software vulnerability detection (SVD), a crucial aspect of software security, is currently lacking. Existing research primarily focuses on evaluating LLMs using C/C++ datasets. It typically explores only one or two strategies among prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning for open-source LLMs. Consequently, there is a significant knowledge gap regarding the effectiveness of diverse LLMs in detecting vulnerabilities across various programming languages. To address this knowledge gap, we present a comprehensive empirical study evaluating the performance of LLMs on the SVD task. We have compiled a comprehensive dataset comprising 8,260 vulnerable functions in Python, 7,505 in Java, and 28,983 in JavaScript. We assess five open-source LLMs using multiple approaches, including prompt engineering, instruction tuning, and sequence classification fine-tuning. These LLMs are benchmarked against five fine-tuned small language models and two open-source static application security testing tools. Furthermore, we explore two avenues to improve LLM performance on SVD: a) Data perspective: Retraining models using downsampled balanced datasets. b) Model perspective: Investigating ensemble learning methods that combine predictions from multiple LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SVD remains a challenging task for LLMs. This study provides a thorough understanding of the role of LLMs in SVD and offers practical insights for future advancements in leveraging generative AI to enhance software security practices.</p></details> |  |

However, research on detecting and analysing joint attention remains limited, particularly for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This study evaluates MLLMs' ability to comprehend joint attention by analysing 26 parent-child interaction videos annotated by two speech-language pathologists. These annotations identify strong and poor joint attention segments, serving as benchmarks for evaluating the models' interpretive capabilities. Our findings reveal that current MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret joint attention due to a lack of nuanced understanding of child-initiated eye contact, a crucial component of joint attention dynamics. This study highlights the importance of incorporating detailed eye contact to enhance MLLMs' multimodal reasoning. Addressing these gaps is essential for future research to advance the use of MLLMs in analysing and supporting parent-child interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems Late Breaking Work (CHI'25 LBW)</p></details> |

With its advanced emergent capabilities, it adapt to a wide range of specific applications. Fine-tuning LLMs for various downstream tasks has become a new paradigm. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) is well-known for its parameter efficiency. It can reduce the number of parameters needed to fine-tune LLMs by several orders of magnitude. However, LoRA-based approaches encounter a significant limitation due to the bottleneck imposed by rank one decomposition. As the parameters count in LLMs increase, even rank one decomposition might surpass the number of parameters truly necessary for handling more downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose a new method for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) via deconvolution in subspace, dubbed as DCFT. We innovatively use deconvolution to complete details and enhance knowledge in subspace incremental matrices, and dynamically control parameters by adjusting the kernel size, unconstrained by rank-one decomposition. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of DCFT. Results show that compared to LoRA, DCFT achieve an 8$\times$ reduction in parameters, and still achieves highly impressive performance.

However, their ability to precisely control summary attributes (e.g., length or topic) remains underexplored, limiting their adaptability to specific user preferences. In this paper, we systematically explore the controllability of LLMs. To this end, we revisit summary attribute measurements and introduce iterative evaluation metrics, failure rate and average iteration count to precisely evaluate controllability of LLMs, rather than merely assessing errors. Our findings show that LLMs struggle more with numerical attributes than with linguistic attributes. To address this challenge, we propose a guide-to-explain framework (GTE) for controllable summarization. Our GTE framework enables the model to identify misaligned attributes in the initial draft and guides it in self-explaining errors in the previous output. By allowing the model to reflect on its misalignment, GTE generates well-adjusted summaries that satisfy the desired attributes with robust effectiveness, requiring surprisingly fewer iterations than other iterative approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, existing artificial intelligence-driven PET/CT analyses rely predominantly on task-specific models trained from scratch or on limited datasets, limiting their generalizability and robustness. To address this, we propose a foundation model approach specifically designed for multimodal PET/CT imaging. We introduce the Cross-Fraternal Twin Masked Autoencoder (FratMAE), a novel framework that effectively integrates whole-body anatomical and functional or molecular information. FratMAE employs separate Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders for PET and CT scans, along with cross-attention decoders that enable synergistic interactions between modalities during masked autoencoder training. Additionally, it incorporates textual metadata to enhance PET representation learning. By pre-training on PET/CT datasets, FratMAE captures intricate cross-modal relationships and global uptake patterns, achieving superior performance on downstream tasks and demonstrating its potential as a generalizable foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/vila-u.

FMs are trained on numerous diverse datasets and claim to be effective forecasters across multiple different time series domains, including cloud data. In this work we investigate this claim, exploring the effectiveness of FMs on cloud data. We demonstrate that many well-known FMs fail to generate meaningful or accurate zero-shot forecasts in this setting. We support this claim empirically, showing that FMs are outperformed consistently by simple linear baselines. We also illustrate a number of interesting pathologies, including instances where FMs suddenly output seemingly erratic, random-looking forecasts. Our results suggest a widespread failure of FMs to model cloud data.</p></details> | 5 pages, Preprint |
| **[A Token-level Text Image Foundation Model for Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02304v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, general visual foundation models (VFMs) have witnessed increasing adoption, particularly as image encoders for popular multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, without semantically fine-grained supervision, these models still encounter fundamental prediction errors in the context of downstream text-image-related tasks, i.e., perception, understanding and reasoning with images containing small and dense texts. To bridge this gap, we develop TokenOCR, the first token-level visual foundation model specifically tailored for text-image-related tasks, designed to support a variety of traditional downstream applications. To facilitate the pretraining of TokenOCR, we also devise a high-quality data production pipeline that constructs the first token-level image text dataset, TokenIT, comprising 20 million images and 1.8 billion token-mask pairs. Furthermore, leveraging this foundation with exceptional image-as-text capability, we seamlessly replace previous VFMs with TokenOCR to construct a document-level MLLM, TokenVL, for VQA-based document understanding tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenOCR and TokenVL. Code, datasets, and weights will be available at https://token-family.github.io/TokenOCR_project.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Most of the ongoing technical validation of foundation models have been applied to optical images like RGB or multi-spectral images. Due to difficulty in semantic labeling to create datasets and higher noise content with respect to optical images, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data has not been explored a lot in the field for foundation models. Therefore, in this work as a pre-training approach, we explored masked auto-encoder, specifically MixMAE on Sentinel-1 SAR images and its impact on SAR image classification tasks. Moreover, we proposed to use the physical characteristic of SAR data for applying weighting parameter on the auto-encoder training loss (MSE) to reduce the effect of speckle noise and very high values on the SAR images. Proposed SAR intensity-based weighting of the reconstruction loss demonstrates promising results both on SAR pre-training and downstream tasks specifically on flood detection compared with the baseline model.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

In order to effectively learn correspondences and mis-correspondences between an image pair for the change detection task, we propose to a) ``freeze'' the backbone in order to retain the generality of dense foundation features, and b) employ ``full-image'' cross-attention to better tackle the viewpoint variations between the image pair. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, VL-CMU-CD and PSCD, along with their viewpoint-varied versions. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score, particularly in scenarios involving geometric changes between image pairs. The results indicate our method's superior generalization capabilities over existing state-of-the-art approaches, showing robustness against photometric and geometric variations as well as better overall generalization when fine-tuned to adapt to new environments. Detailed ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component in our architecture.

Recent studies indicate that scaling-up and advanced design of the recommendation model can bring significant performance improvement. However, with a larger model scale, such prior studies have a significantly increasing gap from industry as they often neglect two fundamental challenges in industrial-scale applications. First, training and inference budgets are restricted for the model to be served, exceeding which may incur latency and impair user experience. Second, large-volume data arrive in a streaming mode with data distributions dynamically shifting, as new users/ads join and existing users/ads leave the system. We propose the External Large Foundation Model (ExFM) framework to address the overlooked challenges. Specifically, we develop external distillation and a data augmentation system (DAS) to control the computational cost of training/inference while maintaining high performance. We design the teacher in a way like a foundation model (FM) that can serve multiple students as vertical models (VMs) to amortize its building cost. We propose Auxiliary Head and Student Adapter to mitigate the data distribution gap between FM and VMs caused by the streaming data issue. Comprehensive experiments on internal industrial-scale applications and public datasets demonstrate significant performance gain by ExFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2025 Industrial Track as Oral Presentation</p></details> |

Despite these advancements, the high inference latency and the "overthinking" issues in model inference impair the efficiency and effectiveness of foundation models, thus limiting their application in real-time clinical settings. To address these challenges, we proposed EPEE (Entropy- and Patience-based Early Exiting), a novel hybrid strategy designed to improve the inference efficiency of foundation models. The core idea was to leverage the strengths of entropy-based and patience-based early exiting methods to overcome their respective weaknesses. To evaluate EPEE, we conducted experiments on three core biomedical tasks-classification, relation extraction, and event extraction-using four foundation models (BERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, and ViT) across twelve datasets, including clinical notes and medical images. The results showed that EPEE significantly reduced inference time while maintaining or improving accuracy, demonstrating its adaptability to diverse datasets and tasks. EPEE addressed critical barriers to deploying foundation models in healthcare by balancing efficiency and effectiveness. It potentially provided a practical solution for real-time clinical decision-making with foundation models, supporting reliable and efficient workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to npj Digital Medicine</p></details> |

Various physiological and behavioural modalities have been explored for this purpose, with Electrocardiogram (ECG) emerging as a standout choice for real-time emotion monitoring, particularly in dynamic and unpredictable driving conditions. Existing methods, however, often rely on multi-channel ECG signals recorded under static conditions, limiting their applicability in real-world dynamic driving scenarios. To address this limitation, the paper introduces ECG-EmotionNet, a novel architecture designed specifically for emotion recognition in dynamic driving environments. ECG-EmotionNet is constructed by adapting a recently introduced ECG Foundation Model (FM) and uniquely employs single-channel ECG signals, ensuring both robust generalizability and computational efficiency. Unlike conventional adaptation methods such as full fine-tuning, linear probing, or low-rank adaptation, we propose an intuitively pleasing alternative, referred to as the nested Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptation. More precisely, each transformer layer of the underlying FM is treated as a separate expert, with embeddings extracted from these experts fused using trainable weights within a gating mechanism. This approach enhances the representation of both global and local ECG features, leading to a 6% improvement in accuracy and a 7% increase in the F1 score, all while maintaining computational efficiency. The effectiveness of the proposed ECG-EmotionNet architecture is evaluated using a recently introduced and challenging driver emotion monitoring dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches face critical limitations: they ignore biological prior knowledge encoded in gene regulatory relationships and fail to leverage multi-omics signals that could provide complementary regulatory insights. In this paper, we propose GRNFormer, a new framework that systematically integrates multi-scale Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) inferred from multi-omics data into RNA foundation model training. Our framework introduces two key innovations. First, we introduce a pipeline for constructing hierarchical GRNs that capture regulatory relationships at both cell-type-specific and cell-specific resolutions. Second, we design a structure-aware integration framework that addresses the information asymmetry in GRNs through two technical advances: (1) A graph topological adapter using multi-head cross-attention to weight regulatory relationships dynamically, and (2) a novel edge perturbation strategy that perturb GRNs with biologically-informed co-expression links to augment graph neural network training. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on three representative downstream tasks across multiple model architectures to demonstrate the effectiveness of GRNFormer. It achieves consistent improvements over state-of-the-art (SoTA) baselines: $3.6\%$ increase in drug response prediction correlation, $9.6\%$ improvement in single-cell drug classification AUC, and $1.1\%$ average gain in gene perturbation prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. IO drivers, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named IOHunter, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in supervised, scarcely-supervised, and cross-IO contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A General Purpose Spectral Foundational Model for Both Proximal and Remote Sensing Spectral Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01628v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral imaging data acquired via multispectral and hyperspectral cameras can have hundreds of channels, where each channel records the reflectance at a specific wavelength and bandwidth. Time and resource constraints limit our ability to collect large spectral datasets, making it difficult to build and train predictive models from scratch. In the RGB domain, we can often alleviate some of the limitations of smaller datasets by using pretrained foundational models as a starting point. However, most existing foundation models are pretrained on large datasets of 3-channel RGB images, severely limiting their effectiveness when used with spectral imaging data. The few spectral foundation models that do exist usually have one of two limitations: (1) they are built and trained only on remote sensing data limiting their application in proximal spectral imaging, (2) they utilize the more widely available multispectral imaging datasets with less than 15 channels restricting their use with hundred-channel hyperspectral images. To alleviate these issues, we propose a large-scale foundational model and dataset built upon the masked autoencoder architecture that takes advantage of spectral channel encoding, spatial-spectral masking and ImageNet pretraining for an adaptable and robust model for downstream spectral imaging tasks.</p></details> |  |

Intrinsic motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards. However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions. In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has focused on using foundation models to inject these semantic biases into exploration. However, these methods often rely on unrealistic assumptions, such as language-embedded environments or access to high-level actions. We propose SEmaNtically Sensible ExploratIon (SENSEI), a framework to equip model-based RL agents with an intrinsic motivation for semantically meaningful behavior. SENSEI distills a reward signal of interestingness from Vision Language Model (VLM) annotations, enabling an agent to predict these rewards through a world model. Using model-based RL, SENSEI trains an exploration policy that jointly maximizes semantic rewards and uncertainty. We show that in both robotic and video game-like simulations SENSEI discovers a variety of meaningful behaviors from image observations and low-level actions. SENSEI provides a general tool for learning from foundation model feedback, a crucial research direction, as VLMs become more powerful.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review.

| **[AnyECG: Foundational Models for Multitask Cardiac Analysis in Real-World Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17711v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrocardiogram (ECG), a non-invasive and affordable tool for cardiac monitoring, is highly sensitive in detecting acute heart attacks. However, due to the lengthy nature of ECG recordings, numerous machine learning methods have been developed for automated heart disease detection to reduce human workload. Despite these efforts, performance remains suboptimal. A key obstacle is the inherent complexity of ECG data, which includes heterogeneity (e.g., varying sampling rates), high levels of noise, demographic-related pattern shifts, and intricate rhythm-event associations. To overcome these challenges, this paper introduces AnyECG, a foundational model designed to extract robust representations from any real-world ECG data. Specifically, a tailored ECG Tokenizer encodes each fixed-duration ECG fragment into a token and, guided by proxy tasks, converts noisy, continuous ECG features into discrete, compact, and clinically meaningful local rhythm codes. These codes encapsulate basic morphological, frequency, and demographic information (e.g., sex), effectively mitigating signal noise. We further pre-train the AnyECG to learn rhythmic pattern associations across ECG tokens, enabling the capture of cardiac event semantics. By being jointly pre-trained on diverse ECG data sources, AnyECG is capable of generalizing across a wide range of downstream tasks where ECG signals are recorded from various devices and scenarios. The experimental results show that AnyECG achieves an average performance improvement of 6% across four critical tasks-anomaly detection, arrhythmia classification, corrupted lead generation, and ultra-long ECG recognition. AnyECG learns common ECG rhythm from data and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in each of these tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, these claims have yet to be thoroughly validated empirically. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains, from language to computer vision, positioning them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a wide range of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, ultimately identifying a promising path to leverage the strengths of both paradigms. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 600 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Recently, foundation models (FMs) leveraging self-supervised pre-training have been widely advocated as a universal solution for diverse downstream tasks. However, open questions remain about their clinical applicability and generalization advantages over end-to-end learning using task-specific (TS) models. Here, we focused on AI with clinical-grade performance for prostate cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading. We present the largest validation of AI for this task, using over 100,000 core needle biopsies from 7,342 patients across 15 sites in 11 countries. We compared two FMs with a fully end-to-end TS model in a multiple instance learning framework. Our findings challenge assumptions that FMs universally outperform TS models. While FMs demonstrated utility in data-scarce scenarios, their performance converged with - and was in some cases surpassed by - TS models when sufficient labeled training data were available. Notably, extensive task-specific training markedly reduced clinically significant misgrading, misdiagnosis of challenging morphologies, and variability across different WSI scanners. Additionally, FMs used up to 35 times more energy than the TS model, raising concerns about their sustainability. Our results underscore that while FMs offer clear advantages for rapid prototyping and research, their role as a universal solution for clinically applicable medical AI remains uncertain. For high-stakes clinical applications, rigorous validation and consideration of task-specific training remain critically important. We advocate for integrating the strengths of FMs and end-to-end learning to achieve robust and resource-efficient AI pathology solutions fit for clinical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 15 figures and an appendix (study protocol) which is previously published, see https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.04.24309948; updated authors list format</p></details> |
| **[Causality Is Key to Understand and Balance Multiple Goals in Trustworthy ML and Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21123v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring trustworthiness in machine learning (ML) systems is crucial as they become increasingly embedded in high-stakes domains. This paper advocates for integrating causal methods into machine learning to navigate the trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. While these objectives should ideally be satisfied simultaneously, they are often addressed in isolation, leading to conflicts and suboptimal solutions. Drawing on existing applications of causality in ML that successfully align goals such as fairness and accuracy or privacy and robustness, this paper argues that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models. Beyond highlighting these trade-offs, we examine how causality can be practically integrated into ML and foundation models, offering solutions to enhance their reliability and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the challenges, limitations, and opportunities in adopting causal frameworks, paving the way for more accountable and ethically sound AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Representation of High-frequency Components for Medical Visual Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14651v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently attracted significant attention for their impressive generalizability across diverse downstream tasks. However, these models are demonstrated to exhibit great limitations in representing high-frequency components and fine-grained details. In many medical imaging tasks, the precise representation of such information is crucial due to the inherently intricate anatomical structures, sub-visual features, and complex boundaries involved. Consequently, the limited representation of prevalent foundation models can result in significant performance degradation or even failure in these tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel pretraining strategy, named Frequency-advanced Representation Autoencoder (Frepa). Through high-frequency masking and low-frequency perturbation combined with adversarial learning, Frepa encourages the encoder to effectively represent and preserve high-frequency components in the image embeddings. Additionally, we introduce an innovative histogram-equalized image masking strategy, extending the Masked Autoencoder approach beyond ViT to other architectures such as Swin Transformer and convolutional networks. We develop Frepa across nine medical modalities and validate it on 32 downstream tasks for both 2D images and 3D volume data. Without fine-tuning, Frepa can outperform other self-supervised pretraining methods and, in some cases, even surpasses task-specific trained models. This improvement is particularly significant for tasks involving fine-grained details, such as achieving up to a +15% increase in DSC for retina vessel segmentation and a +7% increase in IoU for lung nodule detection. Further experiments quantitatively reveal that Frepa enables superior high-frequency representations and preservation in the embeddings, underscoring its potential for developing more generalized and universal medical image foundation models.</p></details> |  |

With the success of visual foundation models (VFMs) in the image domain, leveraging 2D priors to address 3D online segmentation has become a prominent research focus. Since segmentation results provided by 2D priors often require spatial consistency to be lifted into final 3D segmentation, an efficient method for identifying spatial overlap among 2D masks is essential - yet existing methods rarely achieve this in real time, mainly limiting its use to offline approaches. To address this, we propose an efficient method that lifts 2D masks generated by VFMs into a unified 3D instance using a hashing technique. By employing voxel hashing for efficient 3D scene querying, our approach reduces the time complexity of costly spatial overlap queries from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. Accurate spatial associations further enable 3D merging of 2D masks through simple similarity-based filtering in a zero-shot manner, making our approach more robust to incomplete and noisy data. Evaluated on the ScanNet and SceneNN benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in online, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation with leading efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at TMLR (https://openreview.net/forum?id=mSoDRZXsqj)</p></details> |

Those foundation models are typically trained in a prediction-focused manner to maximize forecast quality. In contrast, decision-focused learning directly improves the resulting value of the forecast in downstream optimization rather than merely maximizing forecasting quality. The practical integration of forecast values into forecasting models is challenging, particularly when addressing complex applications with diverse instances, such as buildings. This becomes even more complicated when instances possess specific characteristics that require instance-specific, tailored predictions to increase the forecast value. To tackle this challenge, we use decision-focused fine-tuning within time series foundation models to offer a scalable and efficient solution for decision-focused learning applied to the dispatchable feeder optimization problem. To obtain more robust predictions for scarce building data, we use Moirai as a state-of-the-art foundation model, which offers robust and generalized results with few-shot parameter-efficient fine-tuning. Comparing the decision-focused fine-tuned Moirai with a state-of-the-art classical prediction-focused fine-tuning Morai, we observe an improvement of 9.45% in average total daily costs.</p></details> |  |

Developing foundation models for hypergraphs is challenging due to their distinct data, which includes both vertex features and intricate structural information. We present Hyper-FM, a Hypergraph Foundation Model for multi-domain knowledge extraction, featuring Hierarchical High-Order Neighbor Guided Vertex Knowledge Embedding for vertex feature representation and Hierarchical Multi-Hypergraph Guided Structural Knowledge Extraction for structural information. Additionally, we curate 10 text-attributed hypergraph datasets to advance research between HGNNs and LLMs. Experiments on these datasets show that Hyper-FM outperforms baseline methods by approximately 13.3\%, validating our approach. Furthermore, we propose the first scaling law for hypergraph foundation models, demonstrating that increasing domain diversity significantly enhances performance, unlike merely augmenting vertex and hyperedge counts. This underscores the critical role of domain diversity in scaling hypergraph models.</p></details> |  |

However, there have been limited efforts to evaluate these audio FMs comprehensively on their ability to have natural and interactive conversations. To engage in meaningful conversation with the end user, we would want the FMs to additionally perform a fluent succession of turns without too much overlapping speech or long stretches of silence. Inspired by this, we ask whether the recently proposed audio FMs can understand, predict, and perform turn-taking events? To answer this, we propose a novel evaluation protocol that can assess spoken dialog system's turn-taking capabilities using a supervised model as a judge that has been trained to predict turn-taking events in human-human conversations. Using this protocol, we present the first comprehensive user study that evaluates existing spoken dialogue systems on their ability to perform turn-taking events and reveal many interesting insights, such as they sometimes do not understand when to speak up, can interrupt too aggressively and rarely backchannel. We further evaluate multiple open-source and proprietary audio FMs accessible through APIs on carefully curated test benchmarks from Switchboard to measure their ability to understand and predict turn-taking events and identify significant room for improvement. We will open source our evaluation platform to promote the development of advanced conversational AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

First, we compared the proposed method with previous multitask reinforcement learning methods in the standard multi-locomotion tasks. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the baseline methods. Then, we applied the proposed method to the ball heading task using a monopod robot model to evaluate skill generation performance. The results showed that the proposed method was able to adapt to novel target positions or inexperienced ball restitution coefficients but to acquire a foundational policy network, originally learned for heading motion, which can generate an entirely new overhead kicking skill.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Hypernetworks, neural networks that generate some or all of the parameters of another neural network, have become an increasingly important technique for conditioning and generalizing implicit neural representations (INRs), which represent signals or objects such as audio or 3D shapes using a neural network. However, despite the potential benefits of incorporating foundation models in hypernetwork methods, this research direction has not been investigated, likely due to the dissimilarity of the weight generation task with other visual tasks. To address this gap, we (1) show how foundation models can improve hypernetworks with Transformer-based architectures, (2) provide an empirical analysis of the benefits of foundation models for hypernetworks through the lens of the generalizable INR task, showing that leveraging foundation models improves performance, generalizability, and data efficiency across a variety of algorithms and modalities. We also provide further analysis in examining the design space of foundation model-based hypernetworks, including examining the choice of foundation models, algorithms, and the effect of scaling foundation models.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, these models still struggle with domain gaps in practical applications. Specifically, even after fine-tuning on source-domain data, task-adapted foundation models often perform poorly in the target domain. To address this challenge, we propose a few-shot unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) framework for MFMs, named MFM-DA, which only leverages a limited number of unlabeled target-domain images. Our approach begins by training a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), which is then adapted to the target domain using a proposed dynamic instance-aware adaptor and a distribution direction loss, enabling the DDPM to translate source-domain images into the target domain style. The adapted images are subsequently processed through the MFM, where we introduce a designed channel-spatial alignment Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to ensure effective feature alignment. Extensive experiments on optic cup and disc segmentation tasks demonstrate that MFM-DA outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our work provides a practical solution to the domain gap issue in real-world MFM deployment. Code will be available at here.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning-based segmentation foundation models show potential in developing high-performing models with fewer samples, their medical adaptation faces LN domain-specific prior deficiencies and inefficient few-shot fine-tuning for complex clinical practices, highlighting the necessity of an LN segmentation foundation model. In this work, we annotated 36,106 visible LNs from 3,346 publicly available head-and-neck CT scans to establish a robust LN segmentation model (nnUNetv2).

Despite their impressive performance, these models often exhibit variability when applied to different tasks, prompting the need for a unified framework capable of consistently excelling across various applications. In this work, we propose Shazam, a novel framework designed to efficiently combine multiple CPath models. Unlike previous approaches that train a fixed-parameter FM, Shazam dynamically extracts and refines information from diverse FMs for each specific task. To ensure that each FM contributes effectively without dominance, a novel distillation strategy is applied, guiding the student model with features from all teacher models, which enhances its generalization ability. Experimental results on two pathology patch classification datasets demonstrate that Shazam outperforms existing CPath models and other fusion methods. Its lightweight, flexible design makes it a promising solution for improving CPath analysis in real-world settings.

Data scaling experiments reveal that performance saturates at 60-70% of total data for BYOL and MAE, while SimCLR requires more data.

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1~5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks.

| **[Foundation-Model-Boosted Multimodal Learning for fMRI-based Neuropathic Pain Drug Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00210v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neuropathic pain, affecting up to 10% of adults, remains difficult to treat due to limited therapeutic efficacy and tolerability. Although resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) is a promising non-invasive measurement of brain biomarkers to predict drug response in therapeutic development, the complexity of fMRI demands machine learning models with substantial capacity. However, extreme data scarcity in neuropathic pain research limits the application of high-capacity models. To address the challenge of data scarcity, we propose FMM$_{TC}$, a Foundation-Model-boosted Multimodal learning framework for fMRI-based neuropathic pain drug response prediction, which leverages both internal multimodal information in pain-specific data and external knowledge from large pain-agnostic data. Specifically, to maximize the value of limited pain-specific data, FMM$_{TC}$ integrates complementary information from two rs-fMRI modalities: Time series and functional Connectivity. FMM$_{TC}$ is further boosted by an fMRI foundation model with its external knowledge from extensive pain-agnostic fMRI datasets enriching limited pain-specific information. Evaluations with an in-house dataset and a public dataset from OpenNeuro demonstrate FMM$_{TC}$'s superior representation ability, generalizability, and cross-dataset adaptability over existing unimodal fMRI models that only consider one of the rs-fMRI modalities. The ablation study validates the effectiveness of multimodal learning and foundation-model-powered external knowledge transfer in FMM$_{TC}$. An integrated gradient-based interpretation study explains how FMM$_{TC}$'s cross-dataset dynamic behaviors enhance its adaptability. In conclusion, FMM$_{TC}$ boosts clinical trials in neuropathic pain therapeutic development by accurately predicting drug responses to improve the participant stratification efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Foundational Model for Sleep Analysis Using a Multimodal Hybrid Self-Supervised Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17481v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sleep is essential for maintaining human health and quality of life. Analyzing physiological signals during sleep is critical in assessing sleep quality and diagnosing sleep disorders. However, manual diagnoses by clinicians are time-intensive and subjective. Despite advances in deep learning that have enhanced automation, these approaches remain heavily dependent on large-scale labeled datasets. This study introduces SynthSleepNet, a multimodal hybrid self-supervised learning framework designed for analyzing polysomnography (PSG) data. SynthSleepNet effectively integrates masked prediction and contrastive learning to leverage complementary features across multiple modalities, including electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculography (EOG), electromyography (EMG), and electrocardiogram (ECG). This approach enables the model to learn highly expressive representations of PSG data. Furthermore, a temporal context module based on Mamba was developed to efficiently capture contextual information across signals. SynthSleepNet achieved superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods across three downstream tasks: sleep-stage classification, apnea detection, and hypopnea detection, with accuracies of 89.89%, 99.75%, and 89.60%, respectively. The model demonstrated robust performance in a semi-supervised learning environment with limited labels, achieving accuracies of 87.98%, 99.37%, and 77.52% in the same tasks. These results underscore the potential of the model as a foundational tool for the comprehensive analysis of PSG data. SynthSleepNet demonstrates comprehensively superior performance across multiple downstream tasks compared to other methodologies, making it expected to set a new standard for sleep disorder monitoring and diagnostic systems.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Cell-ontology guided transcriptome foundation model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12373v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transcriptome foundation models TFMs hold great promises of deciphering the transcriptomic language that dictate diverse cell functions by self-supervised learning on large-scale single-cell gene expression data, and ultimately unraveling the complex mechanisms of human diseases. However, current TFMs treat cells as independent samples and ignore the taxonomic relationships between cell types, which are available in cell ontology graphs. We argue that effectively leveraging this ontology information during the TFM pre-training can improve learning biologically meaningful gene co-expression patterns while preserving TFM as a general purpose foundation model for downstream zero-shot and fine-tuning tasks. To this end, we present single cell, Cell-ontology guided TFM scCello. We introduce cell-type coherence loss and ontology alignment loss, which are minimized along with the masked gene expression prediction loss during the pre-training. The novel loss component guide scCello to learn the cell-type-specific representation and the structural relation between cell types from the cell ontology graph, respectively. We pre-trained scCello on 22 million cells from CellxGene database leveraging their cell-type labels mapped to the cell ontology graph from Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology Foundry. Our TFM demonstrates competitive generalization and transferability performance over the existing TFMs on biologically important tasks including identifying novel cell types of unseen cells, prediction of cell-type-specific marker genes, and cancer drug responses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 as Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[TimesBERT: A BERT-Style Foundation Model for Time Series Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21245v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis is crucial in diverse scenarios. Beyond forecasting, considerable real-world tasks are categorized into classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, underscoring different capabilities termed time series understanding in this paper. While GPT-style models have been positioned as foundation models for time series forecasting, the BERT-style architecture, which has made significant advances in natural language understanding, has not been fully unlocked for time series understanding, possibly attributed to the undesirable dropout of essential elements of BERT. In this paper, inspired by the shared multi-granularity structure between multivariate time series and multisentence documents, we design TimesBERT to learn generic representations of time series including temporal patterns and variate-centric characteristics. In addition to a natural adaptation of masked modeling, we propose a parallel task of functional token prediction to embody vital multi-granularity structures. Our model is pre-trained on 260 billion time points across diverse domains. Leveraging multi-granularity representations, TimesBERT achieves state-of-the-art performance across four typical downstream understanding tasks, outperforming task-specific models and language pre-trained backbones, positioning it as a versatile foundation model for time series understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling foundation models for robust and efficient models in digital pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16239v3)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the advent of foundation models (FM) for digital pathology has relied heavily on scaling the pre-training datasets and the model size, yielding large and powerful models. While it resulted in improving the performance on diverse downstream tasks, it also introduced increased computational cost and inference time. In this work, we explore the distillation of a large foundation model into a smaller one, reducing the number of parameters by several orders of magnitude. Leveraging distillation techniques, our distilled model, H0-mini, achieves nearly comparable performance to large FMs at a significantly reduced inference cost. It is evaluated on several public benchmarks, achieving 3rd place on the HEST benchmark and 5th place on the EVA benchmark. Additionally, a robustness analysis conducted on the PLISM dataset demonstrates that our distilled model reaches excellent robustness to variations in staining and scanning conditions, significantly outperforming other state-of-the art models. This opens new perspectives to design lightweight and robust models for digital pathology, without compromising on performance.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[A Non-contrast Head CT Foundation Model for Comprehensive Neuro-Trauma Triage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21106v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in AI and medical imaging offer transformative potential in emergency head CT interpretation for reducing assessment times and improving accuracy in the face of an increasing request of such scans and a global shortage in radiologists. This study introduces a 3D foundation model for detecting diverse neuro-trauma findings with high accuracy and efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) for automatic labeling, we generated comprehensive multi-label annotations for critical conditions. Our approach involved pretraining neural networks for hemorrhage subtype segmentation and brain anatomy parcellation, which were integrated into a pretrained comprehensive neuro-trauma detection network through multimodal fine-tuning. Performance evaluation against expert annotations and comparison with CT-CLIP demonstrated strong triage accuracy across major neuro-trauma findings, such as hemorrhage and midline shift, as well as less frequent critical conditions such as cerebral edema and arterial hyperdensity. The integration of neuro-specific features significantly enhanced diagnostic capabilities, achieving an average AUC of 0.861 for 16 neuro-trauma conditions. This work advances foundation models in medical imaging, serving as a benchmark for future AI-assisted neuro-trauma diagnostics in emergency radiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are foundation models useful feature extractors for electroencephalography analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21086v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of foundation models in natural language processing and computer vision has motivated similar approaches for general time series analysis. While these models are effective for a variety of tasks, their applicability in medical domains with limited data remains largely unexplored. To address this, we investigate the effectiveness of foundation models in medical time series analysis involving electroencephalography (EEG). Through extensive experiments on tasks such as age prediction, seizure detection, and the classification of clinically relevant EEG events, we compare their diagnostic accuracy with that of specialised EEG models. Our analysis shows that foundation models extract meaningful EEG features, outperform specialised models even without domain adaptation, and localise task-specific biomarkers. Moreover, we demonstrate that diagnostic accuracy is substantially influenced by architectural choices such as context length. Overall, our study reveals that foundation models with general time series understanding eliminate the dependency on large domain-specific datasets, making them valuable tools for clinical practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can We Simplify Slide-level Fine-tuning of Pathology Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20823v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of foundation models in computational pathology has transformed histopathological image analysis, with whole slide imaging (WSI) diagnosis being a core application. Traditionally, weakly supervised fine-tuning via multiple instance learning (MIL) has been the primary method for adapting foundation models to WSIs. However, in this work we present a key experimental finding: a simple nonlinear mapping strategy combining mean pooling and a multilayer perceptron, called SiMLP, can effectively adapt patch-level foundation models to slide-level tasks without complex MIL-based learning. Through extensive experiments across diverse downstream tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of SiMLP with state-of-the-art methods. For instance, on a large-scale pan-cancer classification task, SiMLP surpasses popular MIL-based methods by 3.52%. Furthermore, SiMLP shows strong learning ability in few-shot classification and remaining highly competitive with slide-level foundation models pretrained on tens of thousands of slides. Finally, SiMLP exhibits remarkable robustness and transferability in lung cancer subtyping. Overall, our findings challenge the conventional MIL-based fine-tuning paradigm, demonstrating that a task-agnostic representation strategy alone can effectively adapt foundation models to WSI analysis. These insights offer a unique and meaningful perspective for future research in digital pathology, paving the way for more efficient and broadly applicable methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[SemiSAM+: Rethinking Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation in the Era of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20749v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based medical image segmentation typically requires large amount of labeled data for training, making it less applicable in clinical settings due to high annotation cost. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as an appealing strategy due to its less dependence on acquiring abundant annotations from experts compared to fully supervised methods. Beyond existing model-centric advancements of SSL by designing novel regularization strategies, we anticipate a paradigmatic shift due to the emergence of promptable segmentation foundation models with universal segmentation capabilities using positional prompts represented by Segment Anything Model (SAM). In this paper, we present SemiSAM+, a foundation model-driven SSL framework to efficiently learn from limited labeled data for medical image segmentation. SemiSAM+ consists of one or multiple promptable foundation models as generalist models, and a trainable task-specific segmentation model as specialist model. For a given new segmentation task, the training is based on the specialist-generalist collaborative learning procedure, where the trainable specialist model delivers positional prompts to interact with the frozen generalist models to acquire pseudo-labels, and then the generalist model output provides the specialist model with informative and efficient supervision which benefits the automatic segmentation and prompt generation in turn. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one in-house clinical dataset demonstrate that SemiSAM+ achieves significant performance improvement, especially under extremely limited annotation scenarios, and shows strong efficiency as a plug-and-play strategy that can be easily adapted to different specialist and generalist models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector-Quantized Vision Foundation Models for Object-Centric Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20263v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposing visual scenes into objects, as humans do, facilitates modeling object relations and dynamics. Object-Centric Learning (OCL) achieves this by aggregating image or video feature maps into object-level feature vectors, known as \textit{slots}. OCL's self-supervision via reconstructing the input from slots struggles with complex textures, thus many methods employ Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to extract feature maps with better objectness. However, using VFMs merely as feature extractors does not fully unlock their potential. We propose Vector-Quantized VFMs for OCL (VQ-VFM-OCL, or VVO), where VFM features are extracted to facilitate object-level information aggregation and further quantized to strengthen supervision in reconstruction. Our VVO unifies OCL representatives into a concise architecture. Experiments demonstrate that VVO not only outperforms mainstream methods on object discovery tasks but also benefits downstream tasks like visual prediction and reasoning. The source code is available in the supplement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do computer vision foundation models learn the low-level characteristics of the human visual system?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20256v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer vision foundation models, such as DINO or OpenCLIP, are trained in a self-supervised manner on large image datasets. Analogously, substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world, characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system, such as contrast detection, contrast masking, and contrast constancy. Specifically, we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g., DINO, DINOv2, and OpenCLIP), share some of the characteristics of human vision, but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world. Overall, while differences remain, foundation models trained on vision tasks start to align with low-level human vision, with DINOv2 showing the closest resemblance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we propose a diffusion-based method that generates dance movements conditioned on text and music. Our approach extracts music features by combining high-level features obtained by music foundation model with hand-crafted features, thereby enhancing the quality of generated dance sequences. This method effectively leverages the advantages of high-level semantic information and low-level temporal details to improve the model's capability in music feature understanding. To show the merits of the proposed method, we compare it with four music foundation models and two sets of hand-crafted music features. The results demonstrate that our method obtains the most realistic dance sequences and achieves the best match with the input music.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Audio Imagination Workshop of NeurlPS 2024</p></details> |

However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it challenging to find relevant documents for text-based search queries in this language. To address these challenges, this study investigates Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. It begins by developing essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- which serve as foundational components for solutions tailored to Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are then explored using both document titles and content to evaluate retrieval effectiveness. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes without applying stemming, significantly improves retrieval performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an average gain of 9.40% in MAP@10 and 30.35% in nDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM demonstrates strong performance across various retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. Contributions of this work include the development of Labadain-Stopwords (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), Labadain-Stemmer (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and Labadain-Avaliad\'or (a Tetun test collection containing 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 qrels).</p></details> | <details><summary>Refin...</summary><p>Refine the title and improve the content (version 2)</p></details> |

Traditional methods use statistical analysis, abnormal data synthesis modeling, and generation-based models to separate product defect features and complete defect detection. Recently, the emergence of foundation models has brought visual and textual semantic prior knowledge. Many methods are based on foundation models (FM) to improve the accuracy of detection, but at the same time, increase model complexity and slow down inference speed. Some FM-based methods have begun to explore lightweight modeling ways, which have gradually attracted attention and deserve to be systematically analyzed. In this paper, we conduct a systematic survey with comparisons and discussions of foundation model methods from different aspects and briefly review non-foundation model (NFM) methods recently published. Furthermore, we discuss the differences between FM and NFM methods from training objectives, model structure and scale, model performance, and potential directions for future exploration. Through comparison, we find FM methods are more suitable for few-shot and zero-shot learning, which are more in line with actual industrial application scenarios and worthy of in-depth research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

As training data collections grow, manually managing the samples becomes time-consuming, tedious, and prone to errors. Yet recent research shows that the data mixture and the order in which samples are visited during training can significantly influence model accuracy. We build and present Mixtera, a data plane for foundation model training that enables users to declaratively express which data samples should be used in which proportion and in which order during training. Mixtera is a centralized, read-only layer that is deployed on top of existing training data collections and can be declaratively queried. It operates independently of the filesystem structure and supports mixtures across arbitrary properties (e.g., language, source dataset) as well as dynamic adjustment of the mixture based on model feedback. We experimentally evaluate Mixtera and show that our implementation does not bottleneck training and scales to 256 GH200 superchips. We demonstrate how Mixtera supports recent advancements in mixing strategies by implementing the proposed Adaptive Data Optimization (ADO) algorithm in the system and evaluating its performance impact. We also explore the role of mixtures for vision-language models.</p></details> | under submission |
| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

However, interpretability remains crucial for critical applications. In this sense, self-explainable models (SEM) aim to provide interpretable classifiers that decompose predictions into a weighted sum of interpretable concepts. Despite their promise, recent studies have shown that these explanations often lack faithfulness. In this work, we combine VFMs with a novel prototypical architecture and specialized training objectives. By training only a lightweight head (approximately 1M parameters) on top of frozen VFMs, our approach (ProtoFM) offers an efficient and interpretable solution. Evaluations demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive classification performance while outperforming existing models across a range of interpretability metrics derived from the literature.

To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative invariants, as is well established. However, in the realm of continuous distributions, invariant verification becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of integrals in expectation-based program semantics. Our key idea is to soundly under- or over-approximate these integrals via Riemann sums. We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure. On the theoretical side, we prove convergence of our Riemann approximations, and establish coRE-completeness of the central verification problems. On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting discrete probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving continuous sampling. Towards this end, we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure Caesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language. We present several promising case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of OOPSLA 25 paper, 55 pages</p></details> |

Here, we developed CT-FM, a large-scale 3D image-based pre-trained model designed explicitly for various radiological tasks. CT-FM was pre-trained using 148,000 computed tomography (CT) scans from the Imaging Data Commons through label-agnostic contrastive learning.

Furthermore, it remained robust across test-retest settings and indicated reasonable salient regions attached to its embeddings. This study demonstrates the value of large-scale medical imaging foundation models and by open-sourcing the model weights, code, and data, aims to support more adaptable, reliable, and interpretable AI solutions in radiology.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, followed by 9 Extended Data Figures and a Supplementary Information document</p></details> |

While recent video foundation models have shown promise, their applications are hindered by (1) computational inefficiencies and (2) suboptimal performance caused by limited data for pre-training in endoscopy. To address these issues, we present EndoMamba, a foundation model designed for real-time inference while learning generalized spatiotemporal representations. First, to mitigate computational inefficiencies, we propose the EndoMamba backbone, optimized for real-time inference. Inspired by recent advancements in state space models, EndoMamba integrates Bidirectional Mamba blocks for spatial modeling within individual frames and vanilla Mamba blocks for past-to-present reasoning across the temporal domain. This design enables both strong spatiotemporal modeling and efficient inference in online video streams. Second, we propose a self-supervised hierarchical pre-training diagram to enhance EndoMamba's representation learning using endoscopic videos and incorporating general video domain knowledge. Specifically, our approach combines masked reconstruction with auxiliary supervision, leveraging low-level reconstruction to capture spatial-temporal structures and high-level alignment to transfer broader knowledge from a pretrained general-video domain foundation model. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks--classification, segmentation, surgical phase recognition, and localization--demonstrate that EndoMamba outperforms existing foundation models and task-specific methods while maintaining real-time inference speed. The source code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Inference Models for Stochastic Differential Equations: A Transformer-based Approach for Zero-shot Function Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19049v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) describe dynamical systems where deterministic flows, governed by a drift function, are superimposed with random fluctuations dictated by a diffusion function. The accurate estimation (or discovery) of these functions from data is a central problem in machine learning, with wide application across natural and social sciences alike. Yet current solutions are brittle, and typically rely on symbolic regression or Bayesian non-parametrics. In this work, we introduce FIM-SDE (Foundation Inference Model for SDEs), a transformer-based recognition model capable of performing accurate zero-shot estimation of the drift and diffusion functions of SDEs, from noisy and sparse observations on empirical processes of different dimensionalities. Leveraging concepts from amortized inference and neural operators, we train FIM-SDE in a supervised fashion, to map a large set of noisy and discretely observed SDE paths to their corresponding drift and diffusion functions. We demonstrate that one and the same (pretrained) FIM-SDE achieves robust zero-shot function estimation (i.e. without any parameter fine-tuning) across a wide range of synthetic and real-world processes, from canonical SDE systems (e.g. double-well dynamics or weakly perturbed Hopf bifurcations) to human motion recordings and oil price and wind speed fluctuations.</p></details> |  |

The existing video foundational model, InternVideo2, has demonstrated strong potential in video understanding tasks due to its large parameter size and large-scale multimodal data pertaining. Building on this, we explored the transferability of InternVideo2 to video quality assessment under compression scenarios. To design a lightweight model suitable for this task, we proposed a distillation method to equip the smaller model with rich compression quality priors. Additionally, we examined the performance of different backbones during the distillation process. The results showed that, compared to other methods, our lightweight model distilled from InternVideo2 achieved excellent performance in compression video quality assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISCAS 2025(Lecture)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Computational Pathology Foundation Models: Datasets, Adaptation Strategies, and Evaluation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15724v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational pathology foundation models (CPathFMs) have emerged as a powerful approach for analyzing histopathological data, leveraging self-supervised learning to extract robust feature representations from unlabeled whole-slide images. These models, categorized into uni-modal and multi-modal frameworks, have demonstrated promise in automating complex pathology tasks such as segmentation, classification, and biomarker discovery. However, the development of CPathFMs presents significant challenges, such as limited data accessibility, high variability across datasets, the necessity for domain-specific adaptation, and the lack of standardized evaluation benchmarks. This survey provides a comprehensive review of CPathFMs in computational pathology, focusing on datasets, adaptation strategies, and evaluation tasks. We analyze key techniques, such as contrastive learning and multi-modal integration, and highlight existing gaps in current research. Finally, we explore future directions from four perspectives for advancing CPathFMs. This survey serves as a valuable resource for researchers, clinicians, and AI practitioners, guiding the advancement of CPathFMs toward robust and clinically applicable AI-driven pathology solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CommGPT: A Graph and Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Communication Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18763v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) possess human-level cognitive and decision-making capabilities, making them a key technology for 6G. However, applying LLMs to the communication domain faces three major challenges: 1) Inadequate communication data; 2) Restricted input modalities; and 3) Difficulty in knowledge retrieval. To overcome these issues, we propose CommGPT, a multimodal foundation model designed specifically for communications. First, we create high-quality pretraining and fine-tuning datasets tailored in communication, enabling the LLM to engage in further pretraining and fine-tuning with communication concepts and knowledge. Then, we design a multimodal encoder to understand and process information from various input modalities. Next, we construct a Graph and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GRG) framework, efficiently coupling Knowledge Graph (KG) with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for multi-scale learning. Finally, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the CommGPT through experimental validation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Generalizability of Foundation Models for Crop Type Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09451v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. The Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed nations not transferring well to data-scarce developing nations -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select five crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, while only 100 labeled images are sufficient for achieving high overall accuracy, 900 images are required to achieve high average accuracy due to class imbalance. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the Post-Soviet cultural food knowledge of foundation models by constructing BORSch, a multimodal dataset encompassing 1147 and 823 dishes in the Russian and Ukrainian languages, centered around the Post-Soviet region. We demonstrate that leading models struggle to correctly identify the origins of dishes from Post-Soviet nations in both text-only and multimodal Question Answering (QA), instead over-predicting countries linked to the language the question is asked in. Through analysis of pretraining data, we show that these results can be explained by misleading dish-origin co-occurrences, along with linguistic phenomena such as Russian-Ukrainian code mixing. Finally, to move beyond QA-based assessments, we test models' abilities to produce accurate visual descriptions of dishes. The weak correlation between this task and QA suggests that QA alone may be insufficient as an evaluation of cultural understanding. To foster further research, we will make BORSch publicly available at https://github.com/alavrouk/BORSch.</p></details> |  |

However, the resulting trade-offs degrade image quality, limiting clinical acceptability. Although deep learning methods have been used to enhance NICT images, their reliance on large training datasets and limited generalizability across diverse settings hinder practical use. We propose the multi-scale integrated Transformer AMPlifier (TAMP), the first imaging foundation model for universal NICT enhancement. Pre-trained on 10.8 million physics-driven simulated NICT images, TAMP generalizes effectively across various NICT settings, defect degrees, and body regions. Moreover, a parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategy enables TAMP to adapt to specific clinical scenarios using only few slices. Extensive experiments, including radiologists and real-world validations, demonstrate that TAMP consistently improves image quality and clinical acceptability, underscoring its significant potential to advance CT imaging and broaden NICT applications in clinical practice.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of FMs and the principles that have driven advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce MoFM as a novel Motion Foundation Model. MoFM is designed for the semantic understanding of complex human motions in both time and space. To facilitate large-scale training, MotionBook, a comprehensive human motion dictionary of discretized motions is designed and employed. MotionBook utilizes Thermal Cubes to capture spatio-temporal motion heatmaps, applying principles from discrete variational models to encode human movements into discrete units for a more efficient and scalable representation. MoFM, trained on a large corpus of motion data, provides a foundational backbone adaptable to diverse downstream tasks, supporting paradigms such as one-shot, unsupervised, and supervised tasks. This versatility makes MoFM well-suited for a wide range of motion-based applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptMID: Modal Invariant Descriptors Based on Diffusion and Vision Foundation Models for Optical-SAR Image Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18104v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ideal goal of image matching is to achieve stable and efficient performance in unseen domains. However, many existing learning-based optical-SAR image matching methods, despite their effectiveness in specific scenarios, exhibit limited generalization and struggle to adapt to practical applications. Repeatedly training or fine-tuning matching models to address domain differences is not only not elegant enough but also introduces additional computational overhead and data production costs. In recent years, general foundation models have shown great potential for enhancing generalization. However, the disparity in visual domains between natural and remote sensing images poses challenges for their direct application. Therefore, effectively leveraging foundation models to improve the generalization of optical-SAR image matching remains challenge. To address the above challenges, we propose PromptMID, a novel approach that constructs modality-invariant descriptors using text prompts based on land use classification as priors information for optical and SAR image matching. PromptMID extracts multi-scale modality-invariant features by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models and visual foundation models (VFMs), while specially designed feature aggregation modules effectively fuse features across different granularities. Extensive experiments on optical-SAR image datasets from four diverse regions demonstrate that PromptMID outperforms state-of-the-art matching methods, achieving superior results in both seen and unseen domains and exhibiting strong cross-domain generalization capabilities. The source code will be made publicly available https://github.com/HanNieWHU/PromptMID.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Examining the Threat Landscape: Foundation Models and Model Stealing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18077v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) for computer vision learn rich and robust representations, enabling their adaptation to task/domain-specific deployments with little to no fine-tuning. However, we posit that the very same strength can make applications based on FMs vulnerable to model stealing attacks. Through empirical analysis, we reveal that models fine-tuned from FMs harbor heightened susceptibility to model stealing, compared to conventional vision architectures like ResNets. We hypothesize that this behavior is due to the comprehensive encoding of visual patterns and features learned by FMs during pre-training, which are accessible to both the attacker and the victim. We report that an attacker is able to obtain 94.28% agreement (matched predictions with victim) for a Vision Transformer based victim model (ViT-L/16) trained on CIFAR-10 dataset, compared to only 73.20% agreement for a ResNet-18 victim, when using ViT-L/16 as the thief model. We arguably show, for the first time, that utilizing FMs for downstream tasks may not be the best choice for deployment in commercial APIs due to their susceptibility to model theft. We thereby alert model owners towards the associated security risks, and highlight the need for robust security measures to safeguard such models against theft.

| **[Revisiting Convolution Architecture in the Realm of DNA Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18538v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, a variety of methods based on Transformer and state space model (SSM) architectures have been proposed, advancing foundational DNA language models. However, there is a lack of comparison between these recent approaches and the classical architecture convolutional networks (CNNs) on foundation model benchmarks. This raises the question: are CNNs truly being surpassed by these recent approaches based on transformer and SSM architectures? In this paper, we develop a simple but well-designed CNN-based method termed ConvNova. ConvNova identifies and proposes three effective designs: 1) dilated convolutions, 2) gated convolutions, and 3) a dual-branch framework for gating mechanisms. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate that ConvNova significantly outperforms recent methods on more than half of the tasks across several foundation model benchmarks. For example, in histone-related tasks, ConvNova exceeds the second-best method by an average of 5.8%, while generally utilizing fewer parameters and enabling faster computation. In addition, the experiments observed findings that may be related to biological characteristics. This indicates that CNNs are still a strong competitor compared to Transformers and SSMs. We anticipate that this work will spark renewed interest in CNN-based methods for DNA foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the limited real-world data and unbearable consequences of taking detrimental actions, the learning of RL policy is mainly restricted within the simulators. This practice guarantees safety in learning but introduces an inevitable sim-to-real gap in terms of deployment, thus causing degraded performance and risks in execution. There are attempts to solve the sim-to-real problems from different domains with various techniques, especially in the era with emerging techniques such as large foundations or language models that have cast light on the sim-to-real. This survey paper, to the best of our knowledge, is the first taxonomy that formally frames the sim-to-real techniques from key elements of the Markov Decision Process (State, Action, Transition, and Reward). Based on the framework, we cover comprehensive literature from the classic to the most advanced methods including the sim-to-real techniques empowered by foundation models, and we also discuss the specialties that are worth attention in different domains of sim-to-real problems. Then we summarize the formal evaluation process of sim-to-real performance with accessible code or benchmarks. The challenges and opportunities are also presented to encourage future exploration of this direction. We are actively maintaining a repository to include the most up-to-date sim-to-real research work to help domain researchers.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, SSL strategies must be adapted to the type of training data and downstream tasks required. We propose RS3L ("Re-simulation-based self-supervised representation learning"), a novel simulation-based SSL strategy that employs a method of re-simulation to drive data augmentation for contrastive learning in the physical sciences, particularly, in fields that rely on stochastic simulators. By intervening in the middle of the simulation process and re-running simulation components downstream of the intervention, we generate multiple realizations of an event, thus producing a set of augmentations covering all physics-driven variations available in the simulator. Using experiments from high-energy physics, we explore how this strategy may enable the development of a foundation model; we show how RS3L pre-training enables powerful performance in downstream tasks such as discrimination of a variety of objects and uncertainty mitigation. In addition to our results, we make the RS3L dataset publicly available for further studies on how to improve SSL strategies.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Understanding and mitigating negative effects requires parsing data on forests at global scale from a broad array of sensory modalities, and using them in diverse forest monitoring applications. Such diversity in data and applications can be effectively addressed through the development of a large, pre-trained foundation model that serves as a versatile base for various downstream tasks. However, remote sensing modalities, which are an excellent fit for several forest management tasks, are particularly challenging considering the variation in environmental conditions, object scales, image acquisition modes, spatio-temporal resolutions, etc. With that in mind, we present the first unified Forest Monitoring Benchmark (FoMo-Bench), carefully constructed to evaluate foundation models with such flexibility. FoMo-Bench consists of 15 diverse datasets encompassing satellite, aerial, and inventory data, covering a variety of geographical regions, and including multispectral, red-green-blue, synthetic aperture radar and LiDAR data with various temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions. FoMo-Bench includes multiple types of forest-monitoring tasks, spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection. To enhance task and geographic diversity in FoMo-Bench, we introduce TalloS, a global dataset combining satellite imagery with ground-based annotations for tree species classification across 1,000+ categories and hierarchical taxonomic levels. Finally, we propose FoMo-Net, a pre-training framework to develop foundation models with the capacity to process any combination of commonly used modalities and spectral bands in remote sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, AI for Social Impact track</p></details> |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

Recent progress in crystal generation models, which design crystal structures for targeted properties, and foundation atomic models (FAMs), which capture interatomic interactions across the periodic table, has significantly improved inverse materials design. However, an efficient integration of these two approaches remains an open challenge. Here, we present an active learning framework that combines crystal generation models and foundation atomic models to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of inverse design. As a case study, we employ Con-CDVAE to generate candidate crystal structures and MACE-MP-0 FAM as one of the high-throughput screeners for bulk modulus evaluation. Through iterative active learning, we demonstrate that Con-CDVAE progressively improves its accuracy in generating crystals with target properties, highlighting the effectiveness of a property-driven fine-tuning process. Our framework is general to accommodate different crystal generation and foundation atomic models, and establishes a scalable approach for AI-driven materials discovery. By bridging generative modeling with atomic-scale simulations, this work paves the way for more accurate and efficient inverse materials design.</p></details> |  |

PFMs have simplified the development of deep learning models, effectively leveraging prior knowledge to improve diagnostic accuracy in diverse scenarios. However, we find that PFMs sometimes struggle with certain challenges. Specifically, features extracted by PFMs are often contaminated by diagnosis-irrelevant information, i.e., institution-specific features associated with the images. This contamination can lead to spurious correlations, undermining the models' generalization ability when applied in real-world clinical settings. In this work, we first reveal the issue of feature contamination in PFMs, demonstrate the presence of institution-specific features, thoroughly investigate its negative impacts, analyze the underlying causes, and provide insights into potential solutions. Specifically, we find that institution-specific information is embedded in pathological images and can be readily captured by current PFMs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the detrimental impact of this irrelevant information, particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, where reliance on contaminated features leads to significant performance degradation. This indicates that the models are being misled by non-diagnostic information. We further delve into the reasons PFMs extract such institution-specific information and validate our findings. Finally, we propose a simple yet effective solution to mitigate the influence of irrelevant information. This study is not intended to criticize existing PFMs, as they have indeed greatly advanced the development of computational pathology. our aim is to inspire future research to focus on innovative training strategies, rather than relying exclusively on scaling laws, to realize more generalized PFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages,1 figure,14 tables</p></details> |

Existing foundation models are primarily trained on English, limiting their effectiveness for India's population. Indic languages comprise only 1 percent of Common Crawl corpora despite India representing 18 percent of the global population, leading to linguistic biases. Thousands of regional languages, dialects, and code mixing create additional representation challenges due to sparse training data. We introduce Krutrim LLM, a 2 trillion token multilingual model designed for India's linguistic landscape. It incorporates the largest known Indic dataset, mitigating data scarcity and ensuring balanced performance across dialects. Krutrim outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models on Indic benchmarks while maintaining competitive English performance. Despite being significantly smaller in training flops, Krutrim LLM matches or exceeds models like LLAMA-2 on 10 out of 16 tasks, with an average score of 0.57 versus 0.55. This evidences Krutrim's flexible multilingual fluency across diverse linguistic contexts. Krutrim is integrated with real-time search to improve factual accuracy in conversational AI applications. This enhances accessibility for over 1 billion users worldwide.

Foundation Models (FMs), trained on vast datasets through self-supervised learning, enable efficient adaptation across medical imaging tasks while reducing dependency on labeled data. These models demonstrate potential for enhancing fairness, though significant challenges remain in achieving consistent performance across demographic groups. Our review indicates that effective bias mitigation in FMs requires systematic interventions throughout all stages of development. While previous approaches focused primarily on model-level bias mitigation, our analysis reveals that fairness in FMs requires integrated interventions throughout the development pipeline, from data documentation to deployment protocols. This comprehensive framework advances current knowledge by demonstrating how systematic bias mitigation, combined with policy engagement, can effectively address both technical and institutional barriers to equitable AI in healthcare. The development of equitable FMs represents a critical step toward democratizing advanced healthcare technologies, particularly for underserved populations and regions with limited medical infrastructure and computational resources.</p></details> |  |

However, current works in artificial social reasoning all rely on language-only, or language-dominant approaches to benchmark and training models, resulting in systems that are improving in verbal communication but struggle with nonverbal social understanding. To address this limitation, we tap into a novel source of data rich in nonverbal and social interactions -- mime videos. Mimes refer to the art of expression through gesture and movement without spoken words, which presents unique challenges and opportunities in interpreting non-verbal social communication. We contribute a new dataset called MimeQA, obtained by sourcing 221 videos from YouTube, through rigorous annotation and verification, resulting in a benchmark with 101 videos and 806 question-answer pairs. Using MimeQA, we evaluate state-of-the-art video large language models (vLLMs) and find that their overall accuracy ranges from 15-30%. Our analysis reveals that vLLMs often fail to ground imagined objects and over-rely on the text prompt while ignoring subtle nonverbal interactions. Our data resources are released at https://github.com/MIT-MI/MimeQA to inspire future work in foundation models that embody true social intelligence capable of interpreting non-verbal human interactions.</p></details> |  |

In our previous work, we propose a novel method to realize seamless adaptation of foundation models to VPR (SelaVPR). This method can produce both global and local features that focus on discriminative landmarks to recognize places for two-stage VPR by a parameter-efficient adaptation approach. Although SelaVPR has achieved competitive results, we argue that the previous adaptation is inefficient in training time and GPU memory usage, and the re-ranking paradigm is also costly in retrieval latency and storage usage. In pursuit of higher efficiency and better performance, we propose an extension of the SelaVPR, called SelaVPR++. Concretely, we first design a parameter-, time-, and memory-efficient adaptation method that uses lightweight multi-scale convolution (MultiConv) adapters to refine intermediate features from the frozen foundation backbone. This adaptation method does not back-propagate gradients through the backbone during training, and the MultiConv adapter facilitates feature interactions along the spatial axes and introduces proper local priors, thus achieving higher efficiency and better performance. Moreover, we propose an innovative re-ranking paradigm for more efficient VPR. Instead of relying on local features for re-ranking, which incurs huge overhead in latency and storage, we employ compact binary features for initial retrieval and robust floating-point (global) features for re-ranking. To obtain such binary features, we propose a similarity-constrained deep hashing method, which can be easily integrated into the VPR pipeline. Finally, we improve our training strategy and unify the training protocol of several common training datasets to merge them for better training of VPR models. Extensive experiments show that ......</p></details> |  |
| **[Triad: Vision Foundation Model for 3D Magnetic Resonance Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14064v2)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) are pre-trained on extensive image datasets to learn general representations for diverse types of data. These models can subsequently be fine-tuned for specific downstream tasks, significantly boosting performance across a broad range of applications. However, existing vision foundation models that claim to be applicable to various clinical tasks are mostly pre-trained on 3D computed tomography (CT), which benefits from the availability of extensive 3D CT databases. Significant differences between CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in imaging principles, signal characteristics, and data distribution may hinder their practical performance and versatility in MRI-specific applications. Here, we propose Triad, a vision foundation model for 3D MRI. Triad adopts a widely used autoencoder architecture to learn robust representations from 131,170 3D MRI volumes and uses organ-independent imaging descriptions to constrain the semantic distribution of the visual modality. The above pre-training dataset is called Triad-131K, which is currently the largest 3D MRI pre-training dataset. We evaluate Triad across three tasks, namely, organ/tumor segmentation, organ/cancer classification, and medical image registration, in two data modalities (within-domain and out-of-domain) settings using 25 downstream datasets. By initializing models with Triad's pre-trained weights, nnUNet-Triad improves segmentation performance by 2.51% compared to nnUNet-Scratch across 17 datasets. Swin-B-Triad achieves a 3.97% improvement over Swin-B-Scratch in classification tasks across five datasets. SwinUNETR-Triad improves by 4.00% compared to SwinUNETR-Scratch in registration tasks across two datasets.

| **[A Survey on Mechanistic Interpretability for Multi-Modal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17516v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of foundation models has transformed machine learning research, prompting efforts to uncover their inner workings and develop more efficient and reliable applications for better control. While significant progress has been made in interpreting Large Language Models (LLMs), multimodal foundation models (MMFMs) - such as contrastive vision-language models, generative vision-language models, and text-to-image models - pose unique interpretability challenges beyond unimodal frameworks. Despite initial studies, a substantial gap remains between the interpretability of LLMs and MMFMs. This survey explores two key aspects: (1) the adaptation of LLM interpretability methods to multimodal models and (2) understanding the mechanistic differences between unimodal language models and crossmodal systems. By systematically reviewing current MMFM analysis techniques, we propose a structured taxonomy of interpretability methods, compare insights across unimodal and multimodal architectures, and highlight critical research gaps.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 4 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

Nevertheless, these models often struggle with non-verbal audio data, such as vocalizations, baby crying, etc., which are critical for various real-world applications. Audio foundation models well handle non-speech data but also fail to capture the nuanced features of non-verbal human sounds. In this work, we aim to overcome the above shortcoming and propose a novel foundation model, termed voc2vec, specifically designed for non-verbal human data leveraging exclusively open-source non-verbal audio datasets. We employ a collection of 10 datasets covering around 125 hours of non-verbal audio. Experimental results prove that voc2vec is effective in non-verbal vocalization classification, and it outperforms conventional speech and audio foundation models. Moreover, voc2vec consistently outperforms strong baselines, namely OpenSmile and emotion2vec, on six different benchmark datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, voc2vec is the first universal representation model for vocalization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[GEFM: Graph-Enhanced EEG Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19507v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalography (EEG) signals provide critical insights for applications in disease diagnosis and healthcare. However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose Graph-Enhanced EEG Foundation Model (GEFM), a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</p></details> |  |

Yet the data silo challenge and privacy concern remain in healthcare systems, hindering safe medical data sharing and collaborative model development among institutions. The collection and curation of scalable clinical datasets increasingly become the bottleneck for training strong FMs. In this study, we propose Medical Foundation Models Merging (MedForge), a cooperative framework enabling a community-driven medical foundation model development, meanwhile preventing the information leakage of raw patient data and mitigating synchronization model development issues across clinical institutions. MedForge offers a bottom-up model construction mechanism by flexibly merging task-specific Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules, which can adapt to downstream tasks while retaining original model parameters. Through an asynchronous LoRA module integration scheme, the resulting composite model can progressively enhance its comprehensive performance on various clinical tasks. MedForge shows strong performance on multiple clinical datasets (e.g., breast cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer) collected from different institutions. Our major findings highlight the value of collaborative foundation models in advancing multi-center clinical collaboration effectively and cohesively. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/TanZheling/MedForge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional Gradient Projection for Robust Fine-Tuning of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15895v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust fine-tuning aims to adapt large foundation models to downstream tasks while preserving their robustness to distribution shifts. Existing methods primarily focus on constraining and projecting current model towards the pre-trained initialization based on the magnitudes between fine-tuned and pre-trained weights, which often require extensive hyper-parameter tuning and can sometimes result in underfitting. In this work, we propose Directional Gradient Projection (DiGraP), a novel layer-wise trainable method that incorporates directional information from gradients to bridge regularization and multi-objective optimization. Besides demonstrating our method on image classification, as another contribution we generalize this area to the multi-modal evaluation settings for robust fine-tuning. Specifically, we first bridge the uni-modal and multi-modal gap by performing analysis on Image Classification reformulated Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks and further categorize ten out-of-distribution (OOD) VQA datasets by distribution shift types and degree (i.e. near versus far OOD). Experimental results show that DiGraP consistently outperforms existing baselines across Image Classfication and VQA tasks with discriminative and generative backbones, improving both in-distribution (ID) generalization and OOD robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

While numerous forecasting-oriented foundation models have been introduced, there is a notable scarcity of models tailored for time series classification. To address this gap, we present Mantis, a new open-source foundation model for time series classification based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained using a contrastive learning approach. Our experimental results show that Mantis outperforms existing foundation models both when the backbone is frozen and when fine-tuned, while achieving the lowest calibration error. In addition, we propose several adapters to handle the multivariate setting, reducing memory requirements and modeling channel interdependence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08288v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is essential for modeling complex decision-making problems but faces challenges in computational tractability and requires expert formulation. Current deep learning approaches for MILP focus on specific problem classes and do not generalize to unseen classes. To address this shortcoming, we take a foundation model training approach, where we train a single deep learning model on a diverse set of MILP problems to generalize across problem classes. As existing datasets for MILP lack diversity and volume, we introduce MILP-Evolve, a novel LLM-based evolutionary framework that is capable of generating a large set of diverse MILP classes with an unlimited amount of instances. We study our methodology on three key learning tasks that capture diverse aspects of MILP: (1) integrality gap prediction, (2) learning to branch, and (3) a new task of aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions. Our empirical results show that models trained on the data generated by MILP-Evolve achieve significant improvements on unseen problems, including MIPLIB benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of moving towards a foundation model approach for MILP that can generalize to a broad range of MILP applications. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/OptiGuide.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Data Scarcity in Time Series Analysis: A Foundation Model with Series-Symbol Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15466v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant attention. However, challenges such as data scarcity and data imbalance continue to hinder their development. To address this, we consider modeling complex systems through symbolic expressions that serve as semantic descriptors of time series. Building on this concept, we introduce a series-symbol (S2) dual-modulity data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic representations. Leveraging the S2 dataset, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained foundation model for TSA. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA tasks when fine-tuned with downstream task, rivaling foundation models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of dual-modality data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demystifying 5G Polar and LDPC Codes: A Comprehensive Review and Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11053v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper serves as a comprehensive guide for practitioners and scholars aiming to understand the channel coding and decoding schemes integral to the 5G NR standard, with a particular focus on LDPC and polar codes. We start by explaining the design procedures that underlie these channel codes, offering fundamental information from the perspectives of both encoding and decoding. In order to determine the present status of research in this area, we also provide a thorough literature review. Notably, we add comprehensive, standard-specific information to these foundational evaluations that is frequently difficult to extract from technical specification documents. The significance of reviewing and refining the foundations of the aforementioned codes lies in their potential to serve as candidate error-correcting codes for the future 6G standard and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Foundation Models in Medical Image Analysis: Advances and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14584v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), particularly Vision Transformers (ViT) and Segment Anything Model (SAM), has sparked significant advances in the field of medical image analysis. These models have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in capturing long-range dependencies and achieving high generalization in segmentation tasks. However, adapting these large models to medical image analysis presents several challenges, including domain differences between medical and natural images, the need for efficient model adaptation strategies, and the limitations of small-scale medical datasets. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art research on the adaptation of VFMs to medical image segmentation, focusing on the challenges of domain adaptation, model compression, and federated learning. We discuss the latest developments in adapter-based improvements, knowledge distillation techniques, and multi-scale contextual feature modeling, and propose future directions to overcome these bottlenecks. Our analysis highlights the potential of VFMs, along with emerging methodologies such as federated learning and model compression, to revolutionize medical image analysis and enhance clinical applications. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive overview of current approaches and suggest key areas for future research that can drive the next wave of innovation in medical image segmentation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Towards Physics-Guided Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15013v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional foundation models are pre-trained on broad datasets to reduce the training resources (e.g., time, energy, labeled samples) needed for fine-tuning a wide range of downstream tasks. However, traditional foundation models struggle with out-of-distribution prediction and can produce outputs that are unrealistic and physically infeasible. We propose the notation of physics-guided foundation models (PGFM), that is, foundation models integrated with broad or general domain (e.g., scientific) physical knowledge applicable to a wide range of downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FetalCLIP: A Visual-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14807v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.</p></details> |  |

An Analysis of Cross-Lingual and Cross-Modal Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17666v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models aim to create a unified representation space that abstracts away from surface features like language syntax or modality differences. To investigate this, we study the internal representations of three recent models, analyzing the model activations from semantically equivalent sentences across languages in the text and speech modalities. Our findings reveal that: 1) Cross-modal representations converge over model layers, except in the initial layers specialized at text and speech processing. 2) Length adaptation is crucial for reducing the cross-modal gap between text and speech, although current approaches' effectiveness is primarily limited to high-resource languages. 3) Speech exhibits larger cross-lingual differences than text. 4) For models not explicitly trained for modality-agnostic representations, the modality gap is more prominent than the language gap.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |
| **[Transferable and Forecastable User Targeting Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12468v2)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User targeting, the process of selecting targeted users from a pool of candidates for non-expert marketers, has garnered substantial attention with the advancements in digital marketing. However, existing user targeting methods encounter two significant challenges: (i) Poor cross-domain and cross-scenario transferability and generalization, and (ii) Insufficient forecastability in real-world applications. These limitations hinder their applicability across diverse industrial scenarios. In this work, we propose FOUND, an industrial-grade, transferable, and forecastable user targeting foundation model. To enhance cross-domain transferability, our framework integrates heterogeneous multi-scenario user data, aligning them with one-sentence targeting demand inputs through contrastive pre-training. For improved forecastability, the text description of each user is derived based on anticipated future behaviors, while user representations are constructed from historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in cross-domain, real-world user targeting scenarios, showcasing the superior capabilities of FOUND. Moreover, our method has been successfully deployed on the Alipay platform and is widely utilized across various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, accept by The ACM Web Conference 2025 (WWW 2025) Industry Track</p></details> |
