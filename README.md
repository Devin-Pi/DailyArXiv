| **[Learning 3D Object Spatial Relationships from Pre-trained 2D Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19914v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a method for learning 3D spatial relationships between object pairs, referred to as object-object spatial relationships (OOR), by leveraging synthetically generated 3D samples from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. We hypothesize that images synthesized by 2D diffusion models inherently capture plausible and realistic OOR cues, enabling efficient ways to collect a 3D dataset to learn OOR for various unbounded object categories. Our approach begins by synthesizing diverse images that capture plausible OOR cues, which we then uplift into 3D samples. Leveraging our diverse collection of plausible 3D samples for the object pairs, we train a score-based OOR diffusion model to learn the distribution of their relative spatial relationships. Additionally, we extend our pairwise OOR to multi-object OOR by enforcing consistency across pairwise relations and preventing object collisions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness of our method across various object-object spatial relationships, along with its applicability to real-world 3D scene arrangement tasks using the OOR diffusion model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tlb-miss.github.io/oor/</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Satisfaction of Long-Term Spatial Constraints in Multi-Agent Systems: A Distributed Optimization Approach (extended version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19879v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of collaboratively satisfying long-term spatial constraints in multi-agent systems. Each agent is subject to spatial constraints, expressed as inequalities, which may depend on the positions of other agents with whom they may or may not have direct communication. These constraints need to be satisfied asymptotically or after an unknown finite time. The agents' objective is to collectively achieve a formation that fulfills all constraints. The problem is initially framed as a centralized unconstrained optimization, where the solution yields the optimal configuration by maximizing an objective function that reflects the degree of constraint satisfaction. This function encourages collaboration, ensuring agents help each other meet their constraints while fulfilling their own. When the constraints are infeasible, agents converge to a least-violating solution. A distributed consensus-based optimization scheme is then introduced, which approximates the centralized solution, leading to the development of distributed controllers for single-integrator agents. Finally, simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, submitted to 2025 European Control Conference (ECC)</p></details> |
| **[Mind the Gap: Benchmarking Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19707v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools, excelling in tasks that integrate visual and textual comprehension, such as image captioning, visual question answering, and image-text retrieval. However, existing benchmarks for VLMs include spatial components, which often fail to isolate spatial reasoning from related tasks such as object detection or semantic comprehension. In this paper, we address these deficiencies with a multi-faceted approach towards understanding spatial reasoning. Informed by the diverse and multi-dimensional nature of human spatial reasoning abilities, we present a detailed analysis that first delineates the core elements of spatial reasoning: spatial relations, orientation and navigation, mental rotation, and spatial visualization, and then assesses the performance of these models in both synthetic and real-world images, bridging controlled and naturalistic contexts. We analyze 13 state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models, uncovering pivotal insights into their spatial reasoning performance. Our results reveal profound shortcomings in current VLMs, with average accuracy across the 13 models approximating random chance, highlighting spatial reasoning as a persistent obstacle. This work not only exposes the pressing need to advance spatial reasoning within VLMs but also establishes a solid platform for future exploration.

| **[High-Quality Spatial Reconstruction and Orthoimage Generation Using Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19703v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Highly accurate geometric precision and dense image features characterize True Digital Orthophoto Maps (TDOMs), which are in great demand for applications such as urban planning, infrastructure management, and environmental monitoring. Traditional TDOM generation methods need sophisticated processes, such as Digital Surface Models (DSM) and occlusion detection, which are computationally expensive and prone to errors. This work presents an alternative technique rooted in 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), free of explicit DSM and occlusion detection. With depth map generation, spatial information for every pixel within the TDOM is retrieved and can reconstruct the scene with high precision. Divide-and-conquer strategy achieves excellent GS training and rendering with high-resolution TDOMs at a lower resource cost, which preserves higher quality of rendering on complex terrain and thin structure without a decrease in efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficiency of large-scale scene reconstruction and high-precision terrain modeling. This approach provides accurate spatial data, which assists users in better planning and decision-making based on maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[SACB-Net: Spatial-awareness Convolutions for Medical Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19592v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based image registration methods have shown state-of-the-art performance and rapid inference speeds. Despite these advances, many existing approaches fall short in capturing spatially varying information in non-local regions of feature maps due to the reliance on spatially-shared convolution kernels. This limitation leads to suboptimal estimation of deformation fields. In this paper, we propose a 3D Spatial-Awareness Convolution Block (SACB) to enhance the spatial information within feature representations. Our SACB estimates the spatial clusters within feature maps by leveraging feature similarity and subsequently parameterizes the adaptive convolution kernels across diverse regions. This adaptive mechanism generates the convolution kernels (weights and biases) tailored to spatial variations, thereby enabling the network to effectively capture spatially varying information. Building on SACB, we introduce a pyramid flow estimator (named SACB-Net) that integrates SACBs to facilitate multi-scale flow composition, particularly addressing large deformations. Experimental results on the brain IXI and LPBA datasets as well as Abdomen CT datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SACB and the superiority of SACB-Net over the state-of-the-art learning-based registration methods. The code is available at https://github.com/x-xc/SACB_Net .</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Scale generalisation properties of extended scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks on image datasets with spatial scaling variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11140v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the scale generalisation properties of the scale-covariant and scale-invariant Gaussian derivative networks, complemented with both conceptual and algorithmic extensions. For this purpose, Gaussian derivative networks (GaussDerNets) are evaluated on new rescaled versions of the Fashion-MNIST and the CIFAR-10 datasets, with spatial scaling variations over a factor of 4 in the testing data, that are not present in the training data. Additionally, evaluations on the previously existing STIR datasets show that the GaussDerNets achieve better scale generalisation than previously reported for these datasets for other types of deep networks. We first experimentally demonstrate that the GaussDerNets have quite good scale generalisation properties on the new datasets, and that average pooling of feature responses over scales may sometimes also lead to better results than the previously used approach of max pooling over scales. Then, we demonstrate that using a spatial max pooling mechanism after the final layer enables localisation of non-centred objects in image domain, with maintained scale generalisation properties. We also show that regularisation during training, by applying dropout across the scale channels, referred to as scale-channel dropout, improves both the performance and the scale generalisation. In additional ablation studies, we demonstrate that discretisations of GaussDerNets, based on the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel in combination with central difference operators, perform best or among the best, compared to a set of other discrete approximations of the Gaussian derivative kernels. Finally, by visualising the activation maps and the learned receptive fields, we demonstrate that the GaussDerNets have very good explainability properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 24 figures, 18 tables</p></details> |
| **[VideoRefer Suite: Advancing Spatial-Temporal Object Understanding with Video LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00599v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have recently exhibited remarkable capabilities in general video understanding. However, they mainly focus on holistic comprehension and struggle with capturing fine-grained spatial and temporal details. Besides, the lack of high-quality object-level video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark further hinders their advancements. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the VideoRefer Suite to empower Video LLM for finer-level spatial-temporal video understanding, i.e., enabling perception and reasoning on any objects throughout the video. Specially, we thoroughly develop VideoRefer Suite across three essential aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. Firstly, we introduce a multi-agent data engine to meticulously curate a large-scale, high-quality object-level video instruction dataset, termed VideoRefer-700K. Next, we present the VideoRefer model, which equips a versatile spatial-temporal object encoder to capture precise regional and sequential representations. Finally, we meticulously create a VideoRefer-Bench to comprehensively assess the spatial-temporal understanding capability of a Video LLM, evaluating it across various aspects. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our VideoRefer model not only achieves promising performance on video referring benchmarks but also facilitates general video understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures, technical report</p></details> |
| **[RoboSpatial: Teaching Spatial Understanding to 2D and 3D Vision-Language Models for Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16537v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding is a crucial capability that enables robots to perceive their surroundings, reason about their environment, and interact with it meaningfully. In modern robotics, these capabilities are increasingly provided by vision-language models. However, these models face significant challenges in spatial reasoning tasks, as their training data are based on general-purpose image datasets that often lack sophisticated spatial understanding. For example, datasets frequently do not capture reference frame comprehension, yet effective spatial reasoning requires understanding whether to reason from ego-, world-, or object-centric perspectives. To address this issue, we introduce RoboSpatial, a large-scale dataset for spatial understanding in robotics. It consists of real indoor and tabletop scenes, captured as 3D scans and egocentric images, and annotated with rich spatial information relevant to robotics. The dataset includes 1M images, 5k 3D scans, and 3M annotated spatial relationships, and the pairing of 2D egocentric images with 3D scans makes it both 2D- and 3D- ready. Our experiments show that models trained with RoboSpatial outperform baselines on downstream tasks such as spatial affordance prediction, spatial relationship prediction, and robotics manipulation.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[BF-STVSR: B-Splines and Fourier-Best Friends for High Fidelity Spatial-Temporal Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11043v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While prior methods in Continuous Spatial-Temporal Video Super-Resolution (C-STVSR) employ Implicit Neural Representation (INR) for continuous encoding, they often struggle to capture the complexity of video data, relying on simple coordinate concatenation and pre-trained optical flow networks for motion representation. Interestingly, we find that adding position encoding, contrary to common observations, does not improve--and even degrades--performance. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when combined with pre-trained optical flow networks, which can limit the model's flexibility. To address these issues, we propose BF-STVSR, a C-STVSR framework with two key modules tailored to better represent spatial and temporal characteristics of video: 1) B-spline Mapper for smooth temporal interpolation, and 2) Fourier Mapper for capturing dominant spatial frequencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art in various metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, showing enhanced spatial details and natural temporal consistency. Our code is available https://github.com/Eunjnnn/bfstvsr.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[STOP: Integrated Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Prompting for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15973v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained on tremendous image-text pairs, vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated promising zero-shot generalization across numerous image-based tasks. However, extending these capabilities to video tasks remains challenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent video prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing learnable prompts, but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all video sequences, overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial variations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the model's ability to capture essential temporal information for effective video understanding. To address this, we propose an integrated Spatial-TempOral dynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules, the intra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our intra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative regions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal variation, allowing the model to focus on areas with substantial temporal dynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally, to highlight the varying importance of frames for video understanding, we further introduce inter-frame temporal prompts, dynamically inserting prompts between frames with high temporal variance as measured by frame similarity. This enables the model to prioritize key frames and enhances its capacity to understand temporal dependencies across sequences. Extensive experiments on various video benchmarks demonstrate that STOP consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/CVPR2025-STOP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Semi-Parametric Spatial Dispersed Count Model for Precipitation Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19117v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The appropriateness of the Poisson model is frequently challenged when examining spatial count data marked by unbalanced distributions, over-dispersion, or under-dispersion. Moreover, traditional parametric models may inadequately capture the relationships among variables when covariates display ambiguous functional forms or when spatial patterns are intricate and indeterminate. To tackle these issues, we propose an innovative Bayesian hierarchical modeling system. This method combines non-parametric techniques with an adapted dispersed count model based on renewal theory, facilitating the effective management of unequal dispersion, non-linear correlations, and complex geographic dependencies in count data. We illustrate the efficacy of our strategy by applying it to lung and bronchus cancer mortality data from Iowa, emphasizing environmental and demographic factors like ozone concentrations, PM2.5, green space, and asthma prevalence. Our analysis demonstrates considerable regional heterogeneity and non-linear relationships, providing important insights into the impact of environmental and health-related factors on cancer death rates. This application highlights the significance of our methodology in public health research, where precise modeling and forecasting are essential for guiding policy and intervention efforts. Additionally, we performed a simulation study to assess the resilience and accuracy of the suggested method, validating its superiority in managing dispersion and capturing intricate spatial patterns relative to conventional methods. The suggested framework presents a flexible and robust instrument for geographical count analysis, offering innovative insights for academics and practitioners in disciplines such as epidemiology, environmental science, and spatial statistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwiftSpatial: Spatial Joins on Modern Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16520v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial joins are among the most time-consuming spatial queries, remaining costly even in parallel and distributed systems. In this paper, we explore hardware acceleration for spatial joins by proposing SwiftSpatial, an FPGA-based accelerator that can be deployed in data centers and at the edge. SwiftSpatial contains multiple high-performance join units with innovative hybrid parallelism, several efficient memory management units, and an extensible on-chip join scheduler that supports the popular R-tree synchronous traversal and partition-based spatial-merge (PBSM) algorithms. Benchmarked against various CPU and GPU-based spatial data processing systems, SwiftSpatial demonstrates a latency reduction of up to 41.03x relative to the best-performing baseline, while requiring 6.16x less power. The performance and energy efficiency of SwiftSpatial demonstrate its potential to be used in a variety of configurations (e.g., as an accelerator, near storage, in-network) as well as on different devices (e.g., data centers where FPGAs are widely available or mobile devices, which also contain FPGAs for specialized processing).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGMOD 2025</p></details> |
| **[SAMKD: Spatial-aware Adaptive Masking Knowledge Distillation for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07101v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of recent attention-guided feature masking distillation methods perform knowledge transfer via global teacher attention maps without delving into fine-grained clues. Instead, performing distillation at finer granularity is conducive to uncovering local details supplementary to global knowledge transfer and reconstructing comprehensive student features. In this study, we propose a Spatial-aware Adaptive Masking Knowledge Distillation (SAMKD) framework for accurate object detection. Different from previous feature distillation methods which mainly perform single-scale feature masking, we develop spatially hierarchical feature masking distillation scheme, such that the object-aware locality is encoded during coarse-to-fine distillation process for improved feature reconstruction. In addition, our spatial-aware feature distillation strategy is combined with a masking logit distillation scheme in which region-specific feature difference between teacher and student networks is utilized to adaptively guide the distillation process. Thus, it can help the student model to better learn from the teacher counterpart with improved knowledge transfer and reduced gap. Extensive experiments for detection task demonstrate the superiority of our method. For example, when FCOS is used as teacher detector with ResNet101 backbone, our method improves the student network from 35.3\% to 38.8\% mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art distillation methods including MGD, FreeKD and DMKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[GaussTR: Foundation Model-Aligned Gaussian Transformer for Self-Supervised 3D Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13193v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction is fundamental for spatial understanding, yet existing approaches face challenges in scalability and generalization due to their reliance on extensive labeled data and computationally intensive voxel-wise representations. In this paper, we introduce GaussTR, a novel Gaussian-based Transformer framework that unifies sparse 3D modeling with foundation model alignment through Gaussian representations to advance 3D spatial understanding. GaussTR predicts sparse sets of Gaussians in a feed-forward manner to represent 3D scenes. By splatting the Gaussians into 2D views and aligning the rendered features with foundation models, GaussTR facilitates self-supervised 3D representation learning and enables open-vocabulary semantic occupancy prediction without requiring explicit annotations. Empirical experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate GaussTR's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance of 12.27 mIoU, along with a 40% reduction in training time. These results highlight the efficacy of GaussTR for scalable and holistic 3D spatial understanding, with promising implications in autonomous driving and embodied agents.

| **[MetaSpatial: Reinforcing 3D Spatial Reasoning in VLMs for the Metaverse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18470v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MetaSpatial, the first reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework designed to enhance 3D spatial reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), enabling real-time 3D scene generation without the need for hard-coded optimizations. MetaSpatial addresses two core challenges: (i) the lack of internalized 3D spatial reasoning in VLMs, which limits their ability to generate realistic layouts, and (ii) the inefficiency of traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for layout generation tasks, as perfect ground truth annotations are unavailable. Our key innovation is a multi-turn RL-based optimization mechanism that integrates physics-aware constraints and rendered image evaluations, ensuring generated 3D layouts are coherent, physically plausible, and aesthetically consistent. Methodologically, MetaSpatial introduces an adaptive, iterative reasoning process, where the VLM refines spatial arrangements over multiple turns by analyzing rendered outputs, improving scene coherence progressively. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MetaSpatial significantly enhances the spatial consistency and formatting stability of various scale models. Post-training, object placements are more realistic, aligned, and functionally coherent, validating the effectiveness of RL for 3D spatial reasoning in metaverse, AR/VR, digital twins, and game development applications. Our code, data, and training pipeline are publicly available at https://github.com/PzySeere/MetaSpatial.</p></details> | Working Paper |
| **[Instructing the Architecture Search for Spatial-temporal Sequence Forecasting with LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17994v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal sequence forecasting (STSF) is a long-standing research problem with widespread real-world applications. Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem. However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM. Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism. Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability. On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p></details> |  |
| **[GSound-SIR: A Spatial Impulse Response Ray-Tracing and High-order Ambisonic Auralization Python Toolkit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17866v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and efficient simulation of room impulse responses is crucial for spatial audio applications. However, existing acoustic ray-tracing tools often operate as black boxes and only output impulse responses (IRs), providing limited access to intermediate data or spatial fidelity. To address those problems, this paper presents GSound-SIR, a novel Python-based toolkit for room acoustics simulation that addresses these limitations. The contribution of this paper includes the follows. First, GSound-SIR provides direct access to up to millions of raw ray data points from simulations, enabling in-depth analysis of sound propagation paths that was not possible with previous solutions. Second, we introduce a tool to convert acoustic rays into high-order Ambisonic impulse response synthesis, capturing spatial audio cues with greater fidelity than standard techniques. Third, to enhance efficiency, the toolkit implements an energy-based filtering algorithm and can export only the top-X or top-X-% rays. Fourth, we propose to store the simulation results into Parquet formats, facilitating fast data I/O and seamless integration with data analysis workflows. Together, these features make GSound-SIR an advanced, efficient, and modern foundation for room acoustics research, providing researchers and developers with a powerful new tool for spatial audio exploration. We release the library under Apache 2.0 License at https://github.com/yongyizang/GSound-SIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Validation for Predictive Methods in Spatial Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03527v3)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial prediction tasks are key to weather forecasting, studying air pollution impacts, and other scientific endeavors. Determining how much to trust predictions made by statistical or physical methods is essential for the credibility of scientific conclusions. Unfortunately, classical approaches for validation fail to handle mismatch between locations available for validation and (test) locations where we want to make predictions. This mismatch is often not an instance of covariate shift (as commonly formalized) because the validation and test locations are fixed (e.g., on a grid or at select points) rather than i.i.d. from two distributions. In the present work, we formalize a check on validation methods: that they become arbitrarily accurate as validation data becomes arbitrarily dense. We show that classical and covariate-shift methods can fail this check. We propose a method that builds from existing ideas in the covariate-shift literature, but adapts them to the validation data at hand. We prove that our proposal passes our check. And we demonstrate its advantages empirically on simulated and real data.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 14 figures, Accepted at Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Fourier Neural Operators with Local Spatial Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17797v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial Differential Equation (PDE) problems often exhibit strong local spatial structures, and effectively capturing these structures is critical for approximating their solutions. Recently, the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) has emerged as an efficient approach for solving these PDE problems. By using parametrization in the frequency domain, FNOs can efficiently capture global patterns. However, this approach inherently overlooks the critical role of local spatial features, as frequency-domain parameterized convolutions primarily emphasize global interactions without encoding comprehensive localized spatial dependencies. Although several studies have attempted to address this limitation, their extracted Local Spatial Features (LSFs) remain insufficient, and computational efficiency is often compromised. To address this limitation, we introduce a convolutional neural network (CNN) preprocessor to extract LSFs directly from input data, resulting in a hybrid architecture termed \textit{Conv-FNO}. Furthermore, we introduce two novel resizing schemes to make our Conv-FNO resolution invariant. In this work, we focus on demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating LSFs into FNOs by conducting both a theoretical analysis and extensive numerical experiments. Our findings show that this simple yet impactful modification enhances the representational capacity of FNOs and significantly improves performance on challenging PDE benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Community Detection Analysis of Spatial Transcriptomics Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12351v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial transcriptomics (ST) data produced by recent biotechnologies, such as CosMx and Xenium, contain huge amount of information about cancer tissue samples, which has great potential for cancer research via detection of community: a collection of cells with distinct cell-type composition and similar neighboring patterns. But existing clustering methods do not work well for community detection of CosMx ST data, and the commonly used kNN compositional data method shows lack of informative neighboring cell patterns for huge CosMx data. In this article, we propose a novel and more informative disk compositional data (DCD) method, which identifies neighboring patterns of each cell via taking into account of ST data features from recent new technologies. After initial processing ST data into DCD matrix, a new innovative and interpretable DCD-TMHC community detection method is proposed here. Extensive simulation studies and CosMx breast cancer data analysis clearly show that our proposed DCD-TMHC method is superior to other methods. Based on the communities detected by DCD-TMHC method for CosMx breast cancer data, the logistic regression analysis results demonstrate that DCD-TMHC method is clearly interpretable and superior, especially in terms of assessment for different stages of cancer. These suggest that our proposed novel, innovative, informative and interpretable DCD-TMHC method here will be helpful and have impact to future cancer research based on ST data, which can improve cancer diagnosis and monitor cancer treatment progress.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Semantics: Rediscovering Spatial Awareness in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17349v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel at identifying and describing objects but struggle with spatial reasoning such as accurately understanding the relative positions of objects. Inspired by the dual-pathway (ventral-dorsal) model of human vision, we investigate why VLMs fail spatial tasks despite strong object recognition capabilities. Our interpretability-driven analysis reveals a critical underlying cause: vision embeddings in VLMs are treated primarily as semantic ``bag-of-tokens," overshadowing subtle yet crucial positional cues due to their disproportionately large embedding norms. We validate this insight through extensive diagnostic experiments, demonstrating minimal performance impact when token orders or fine-grained spatial details are removed. Guided by these findings, we propose simple, interpretable interventions, including normalizing vision embedding norms and extracting mid-layer spatially rich features, to restore spatial awareness. Empirical results on both our synthetic data and standard benchmarks demonstrate improved spatial reasoning capabilities, highlighting the value of interpretability-informed design choices. Our study not only uncovers fundamental limitations in current VLM architectures but also provides actionable insights for enhancing structured perception of visual scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Spatial Attention Network (TSAN) for DoS Attack Detection in Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16047v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks remain a critical threat to network security, disrupting services and causing significant economic losses. Traditional detection methods, including statistical and rule-based models, struggle to adapt to evolving attack patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Temporal-Spatial Attention Network (TSAN) architecture for detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in network traffic. By leveraging both temporal and spatial features of network traffic, our approach captures complex traffic patterns and anomalies that traditional methods might miss. The TSAN model incorporates transformer-based temporal encoding, convolutional spatial encoding, and a cross-attention mechanism to fuse these complementary feature spaces. Additionally, we employ multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks to enhance the model's robustness. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that TSAN outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment. The proposed architecture offers an optimal balance between detection accuracy and computational overhead, making it highly suitable for real-world network security applications.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 5 figures |
| **[Uni-3DAR: Unified 3D Generation and Understanding via Autoregression on Compressed Spatial Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16278v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models and their multi-modal extensions have demonstrated the effectiveness of unifying generation and understanding through autoregressive next-token prediction. However, despite the critical role of 3D structural generation and understanding (3D GU) in AI for science, these tasks have largely evolved independently, with autoregressive methods remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Uni-3DAR, a unified framework that seamlessly integrates 3D GU tasks via autoregressive prediction. At its core, Uni-3DAR employs a novel hierarchical tokenization that compresses 3D space using an octree, leveraging the inherent sparsity of 3D structures. It then applies an additional tokenization for fine-grained structural details, capturing key attributes such as atom types and precise spatial coordinates in microscopic 3D structures. We further propose two optimizations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The first is a two-level subtree compression strategy, which reduces the octree token sequence by up to 8x. The second is a masked next-token prediction mechanism tailored for dynamically varying token positions, significantly boosting model performance.

| **[Design of an Expression Recognition Solution Based on the Global Channel-Spatial Attention Mechanism and Proportional Criterion Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11935v3)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression recognition is a challenging classification task that holds broad application prospects in the field of human-computer interaction. This paper aims to introduce the method we will adopt in the 8th Affective and Behavioral Analysis in the Wild (ABAW) Competition, which will be held during the Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR) in 2025.First of all, we apply the frequency masking technique and the method of extracting data at equal time intervals to conduct targeted processing on the original videos. Then, based on the residual hybrid convolutional neural network and the multi-branch convolutional neural network respectively, we design feature extraction models for image and audio sequences. In particular, we propose a global channel-spatial attention mechanism to enhance the features initially extracted from both the audio and image modalities respectively.Finally, we adopt a decision fusion strategy based on the proportional criterion to fuse the classification results of the two single modalities, obtain an emotion probability vector, and output the final emotional classification. We also design a coarse - fine granularity loss function to optimize the performance of the entire network, which effectively improves the accuracy of facial expression recognition.In the facial expression recognition task of the 8th ABAW Competition, our method ranked third on the official validation set. This result fully confirms the effectiveness and competitiveness of the method we have proposed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stack Transformer Based Spatial-Temporal Attention Model for Dynamic Multi-Culture Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16855v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hand gesture-based Sign Language Recognition (SLR) serves as a crucial communication bridge between deaf and non-deaf individuals. Existing SLR systems perform well for their cultural SL but may struggle with multi-cultural sign languages (McSL). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Stack Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network that leverages multi-head attention mechanisms to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies with hierarchical features using the Stack Transfer concept. In the proceed, firstly, we applied a fully connected layer to make a embedding vector which has high expressive power from the original dataset, then fed them a stack newly proposed transformer to achieve hierarchical features with short-range and long-range dependency. The network architecture is composed of several stages that process spatial and temporal relationships sequentially, ensuring effective feature extraction. After making the fully connected layer, the embedding vector is processed by the Spatial Multi-Head Attention Transformer, which captures spatial dependencies between joints. In the next stage, the Temporal Multi-Head Attention Transformer captures long-range temporal dependencies, and again, the features are concatenated with the output using another skip connection. The processed features are then passed to the Feed-Forward Network (FFN), which refines the feature representations further. After the FFN, additional skip connections are applied to combine the output with earlier layers, followed by a final normalization layer to produce the final output feature tensor. This process is repeated for 10 transformer blocks. The extensive experiment shows that the JSL, KSL and ASL datasets achieved good performance accuracy. Our approach demonstrates improved performance in McSL, and it will be consider as a novel work in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Hallucinations in Multimodal Spatial Relations through Constraint-Aware Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08317v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial relation hallucinations pose a persistent challenge in large vision-language models (LVLMs), leading to generate incorrect predictions about object positions and spatial configurations within an image. To address this issue, we propose a constraint-aware prompting framework designed to reduce spatial relation hallucinations. Specifically, we introduce two types of constraints: (1) bidirectional constraint, which ensures consistency in pairwise object relations, and (2) transitivity constraint, which enforces relational dependence across multiple objects. By incorporating these constraints, LVLMs can produce more spatially coherent and consistent outputs. We evaluate our method on three widely-used spatial relation datasets, demonstrating performance improvements over existing approaches. Additionally, a systematic analysis of various bidirectional relation analysis choices and transitivity reference selections highlights greater possibilities of our methods in incorporating constraints to mitigate spatial relation hallucinations.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[ST-Prompt Guided Histological Hypergraph Learning for Spatial Gene Expression Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16816v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) reveals the spatial distribution of gene expression in tissues, offering critical insights into biological processes and disease mechanisms. However, predicting ST from H\&E-stained histology images is challenging due to the heterogeneous relationship between histomorphology and gene expression, which arises from substantial variability across different patients and tissue sections. A more practical and valuable approach is to utilize ST data from a few local regions to predict the spatial transcriptomic landscape across the remaining regions in H&E slides. In response, we propose PHG2ST, an ST-prompt guided histological hypergraph learning framework, which leverages sparse ST signals as prompts to guide histological hypergraph learning for global spatial gene expression prediction. Our framework fuses histological hypergraph representations at multiple scales through a masked ST-prompt encoding mechanism, improving robustness and generalizability. Benchmark evaluations on two public ST datasets demonstrate that PHG2ST outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods and closely aligns with the ground truth. These results underscore the potential of leveraging sparse local ST data for scalable and cost-effective spatial gene expression mapping in real-world biomedical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Role of Spatial Mixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16760v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Until quite recently, the backbone of nearly every state-of-the-art computer vision model has been the 2D convolution. At its core, a 2D convolution simultaneously mixes information across both the spatial and channel dimensions of a representation. Many recent computer vision architectures consist of sequences of isotropic blocks that disentangle the spatial and channel-mixing components. This separation of the operations allows us to more closely juxtapose the effects of spatial and channel mixing in deep learning. In this paper, we take an initial step towards garnering a deeper understanding of the roles of these mixing operations. Through our experiments and analysis, we discover that on both classical (ResNet) and cutting-edge (ConvMixer) models, we can reach nearly the same level of classification performance by and leaving the spatial mixers at their random initializations. Furthermore, we show that models with random, fixed spatial mixing are naturally more robust to adversarial perturbations. Lastly, we show that this phenomenon extends past the classification regime, as such models can also decode pixel-shuffled images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-temporal models for forest inventory data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16691v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) program conducts a national forest inventory for the United States through a network of permanent field plots. FIA produces estimates of area averages/totals for plot-measured forest variables through design-based inference, assuming a fixed population and a probability sample of field plot locations. The fixed-population assumption and characteristics of the FIA sampling scheme make it difficult to estimate change in forest variables over time using design-based inference. We propose spatial-temporal models based on Gaussian processes as a flexible tool for forest inventory data, capable of inferring forest variables and change thereof over arbitrary spatial and temporal domains. It is shown to be beneficial for the covariance function governing the latent Gaussian process to account for variation at multiple scales, separating spatially local variation from ecosystem-scale variation. We demonstrate a model for forest biomass density, inferring 20 years of biomass change within two US National Forests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Data Science Languages: commonalities and needs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16686v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent workshops brought together several developers, educators and users of software packages extending popular languages for spatial data handling, with a primary focus on R, Python and Julia. Common challenges discussed included handling of spatial or spatio-temporal support, geodetic coordinates, in-memory vector data formats, data cubes, inter-package dependencies, packaging upstream libraries, differences in habits or conventions between the GIS and physical modelling communities, and statistical models. The following set of insights have been formulated: (i) considering software problems across data science language silos helps to understand and standardise analysis approaches, also outside the domain of formal standardisation bodies; (ii) whether attribute variables have block or point support, and whether they are spatially intensive or extensive has consequences for permitted operations, and hence for software implementing those; (iii) handling geometries on the sphere rather than on the flat plane requires modifications to the logic of {\em simple features}, (iv) managing communities and fostering diversity is a necessary, on-going effort, and (v) tools for cross-language development need more attention and support.</p></details> |  |
| **[M3: 3D-Spatial MultiModal Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16413v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present 3D Spatial MultiModal Memory (M3), a multimodal memory system designed to retain information about medium-sized static scenes through video sources for visual perception. By integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting techniques with foundation models, M3 builds a multimodal memory capable of rendering feature representations across granularities, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. In our exploration, we identify two key challenges in previous works on feature splatting: (1) computational constraints in storing high-dimensional features for each Gaussian primitive, and (2) misalignment or information loss between distilled features and foundation model features. To address these challenges, we propose M3 with key components of principal scene components and Gaussian memory attention, enabling efficient training and inference. To validate M3, we conduct comprehensive quantitative evaluations of feature similarity and downstream tasks, as well as qualitative visualizations to highlight the pixel trace of Gaussian memory attention. Our approach encompasses a diverse range of foundation models, including vision-language models (VLMs), perception models, and large multimodal and language models (LMMs/LLMs). Furthermore, to demonstrate real-world applicability, we deploy M3's feature field in indoor scenes on a quadruped robot. Notably, we claim that M3 is the first work to address the core compression challenges in 3D feature distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025 homepage: https://m3-spatial-memory.github.io code: https://github.com/MaureenZOU/m3-spatial</p></details> |
| **[PSA-MIL: A Probabilistic Spatial Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16284v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whole Slide Images (WSIs) are high-resolution digital scans widely used in medical diagnostics. WSI classification is typically approached using Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), where the slide is partitioned into tiles treated as interconnected instances. While attention-based MIL methods aim to identify the most informative tiles, they often fail to fully exploit the spatial relationships among them, potentially overlooking intricate tissue structures crucial for accurate diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose Probabilistic Spatial Attention MIL (PSA-MIL), a novel attention-based MIL framework that integrates spatial context into the attention mechanism through learnable distance-decayed priors, formulated within a probabilistic interpretation of self-attention as a posterior distribution. This formulation enables a dynamic inference of spatial relationships during training, eliminating the need for predefined assumptions often imposed by previous approaches. Additionally, we suggest a spatial pruning strategy for the posterior, effectively reducing self-attention's quadratic complexity. To further enhance spatial modeling, we introduce a diversity loss that encourages variation among attention heads, ensuring each captures distinct spatial representations. Together, PSA-MIL enables a more data-driven and adaptive integration of spatial context, moving beyond predefined constraints. We achieve state-of-the-art performance across both contextual and non-contextual baselines, while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[On prior smoothing with discrete spatial data in the context of disease mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16151v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Disease mapping attempts to explain observed health event counts across areal units, typically using Markov random field models. These models rely on spatial priors to account for variation in raw relative risk or rate estimates. Spatial priors introduce some degree of smoothing, wherein, for any particular unit, empirical risk or incidence estimates are either adjusted towards a suitable mean or incorporate neighbor-based smoothing. While model explanation may be the primary focus, the literature lacks a comparison of the amount of smoothing introduced by different spatial priors. Additionally, there has been no investigation into how varying the parameters of these priors influences the resulting smoothing. This study examines seven commonly used spatial priors through both simulations and real data analyses. Using areal maps of peninsular Spain and England, we analyze smoothing effects with two datasets with associated populations at risk. We propose empirical metrics to quantify the smoothing achieved by each model and theoretical metrics to calibrate the expected extent of smoothing as a function of model parameters. We employ areal maps in order to quantitatively characterize the extent of smoothing within and across the models as well as to link the theoretical metrics to the empirical metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[HS-FPN: High Frequency and Spatial Perception FPN for Tiny Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10116v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) has significantly improved object detection performance. However, substantial challenges remain in detecting tiny objects, as their features occupy only a very small proportion of the feature maps. Although FPN integrates multi-scale features, it does not directly enhance or enrich the features of tiny objects. Furthermore, FPN lacks spatial perception ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel High Frequency and Spatial Perception Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) with two innovative modules. First, we designed a high frequency perception module (HFP) that generates high frequency responses through high pass filters. These high frequency responses are used as mask weights from both spatial and channel perspectives to enrich and highlight the features of tiny objects in the original feature maps. Second, we developed a spatial dependency perception module (SDP) to capture the spatial dependencies that FPN lacks. Our experiments demonstrate that detectors based on HS-FPN exhibit competitive advantages over state-of-the-art models on the AI-TOD dataset for tiny object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,12 figures,7 tables</p></details> |

We observe that existing Video-LLMs often suffer from action-scene hallucination due to two main factors. First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features by applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the standard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to overemphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders. To address these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal representations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention, a novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens within the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions between the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the dimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens to maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens. To evaluate the action-scene hallucination in Video-LLMs, we introduce the UNSCENE benchmark with 1,320 videos and 4,078 QA pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on the UNSCENE benchmark, as well as on existing video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Accurate measurement of the AoP and HSD requires a structured process. This begins with identifying standardized ultrasound planes, followed by the detection of specific anatomical landmarks within the regions of the pubic symphysis and fetal head that correlate with the delivery parameters AoP and HSD. Finally, these measurements are derived based on the identified anatomical landmarks. Addressing the clinical demands and standard operation process outlined in the ISUOG guideline, we introduce the Sequential Spatial-Temporal Network (SSTN), the first interpretable model specifically designed for the video of intrapartum ultrasound analysis. The SSTN operates by first identifying ultrasound planes, then segmenting anatomical structures such as the pubic symphysis and fetal head, and finally detecting key landmarks for precise measurement of HSD and AoP. Furthermore, the cohesive framework leverages task-related information to improve accuracy and reliability. Experimental evaluations on clinical datasets demonstrate that SSTN significantly surpasses existing models, reducing the mean absolute error by 18% for AoP and 22% for HSD.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to 2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |

The proposed framework constructs 3DSGs consisting of a fundamental layer with rich metric-semantic information, an object layer featuring precise point-cloud representation of object nodes as well as visual descriptors, and higher layers of room, floor, and building nodes. Thanks to the innovative application of LLMs, not only object nodes but also nodes of higher layers, e.g., room nodes, are annotated in an intelligent and accurate manner. A polling mechanism for room classification using LLMs is proposed to enhance the accuracy and reliability of the room node annotation. Thorough numerical experiments demonstrate the system's ability to integrate semantic descriptions with geometric data, creating an accurate and comprehensive representation of the environment instrumental for context-aware navigation and task planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by WRC SARA 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we study the enhancement of traffic forecasting with pre-training, focusing on spatio-temporal graph methods. While various machine learning methods to solve traffic forecasting problems have been explored and extensively studied, there is a gap of a more contextual approach: studying how relevant non-traffic data can improve prediction performance on traffic forecasting problems. We call this data spatial context. We introduce a novel method of combining road and traffic information through the notion of a traffic quotient graph, a quotient graph formed from road geometry and traffic sensors. We also define a way to encode this relationship in the form of a geometric encoder, pre-trained using contrastive learning methods and enhanced with OpenStreetMap data. We introduce and discuss ways to integrate this geometric encoder with existing graph neural network (GNN)-based traffic forecasting models, using a contrastive pre-training paradigm. We demonstrate the potential for this hybrid model to improve generalisation and performance with zero additional traffic data.

The spatial variation of cases if often compared to that of a set of controls to assess spatial risk variation as well as the detection of risk factors and exposure to putative pollution sources using spatial regression models. The intensities of the point patterns of cases and controls are estimated using log-Gaussian Cox models, so that fixed and spatial random effects can be included. Bayesian inference is conducted via the integrated Nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method using the inlabru R package. In this way, potential risk factors can be assessed by including them as fixed effects while residual spatial variation is considered as a Gaussian process with Mat\'ern covariance. In addition, exposure to pollution sources is modeled using different smooth terms. The proposed methods have been applied to the Chorley-Ribble dataset, that records the locations of lung and larynx cancer cases as well as the location of an disused old incinerator in the area of Lancashire (England, United Kingdom). Taking the locations of lung cancer as controls, the spatial variation of both types of cases has been estimated and the increase of larynx cases in the vicinity of the incinerator has been assessed. The results are similar to those found in the literature. In a nutshell, a framework for Bayesian analysis of multivariate case-control point patterns within an epidemiological framework has been presented. Models to assess spatial variation and the effect of risk factors and pollution sources can be fit with ease with the inlabru R package.</p></details> |  |

However, obtained data include not only continuous but also discrete data, such as binaries and counts (referred to as mixed outcomes), as well as spatial correlations, both of which make conventional multivariate analysis tools impractical. To solve this issue, we propose semiparametric Bayesian inference and develop an efficient algorithm for computing the posterior of the dependence structure based on the rank likelihood under a latent multivariate spatial Gaussian process using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. To alleviate the computational intractability caused by the Gaussian process, we also provide a scalable implementation that leverages the nearest-neighbor Gaussian process. Extensive numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method reliably infers the dependence structures of spatially correlated mixed outcomes. Finally, we apply the proposed method to a dataset collected during an international synoptic krill survey in the Scotia Sea of the Antarctic Peninsula to infer the dependence structure between fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), krill biomass, and relevant oceanographic data.</p></details> | 29 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Variational Autoencoded Multivariate Spatial Fay-Herriot Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14710v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Small area estimation models are essential for estimating population characteristics in regions with limited sample sizes, thereby supporting policy decisions, demographic studies, and resource allocation, among other use cases. The spatial Fay-Herriot model is one such approach that incorporates spatial dependence to improve estimation by borrowing strength from neighboring regions. However, this approach often requires substantial computational resources, limiting its scalability for high-dimensional datasets, especially when considering multiple (multivariate) responses. This paper proposes two methods that integrate the multivariate spatial Fay-Herriot model with spatial random effects, learned through variational autoencoders, to efficiently leverage spatial structure. Importantly, after training the variational autoencoder to represent spatial dependence for a given set of geographies, it may be used again in future modeling efforts, without the need for retraining. Additionally, the use of the variational autoencoder to represent spatial dependence results in extreme improvements in computational efficiency, even for massive datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using 5-year period estimates from the American Community Survey over all census tracts in California.</p></details> |  |

We present a weakly supervised spatial implicit neural representation (SINR) method to address modality differences and pelvic anatomy challenges. Methods: The framework uses sparse surface supervision from MRI/US segmentations instead of dense intensity matching. SINR models deformations as continuous spatial functions, with patient-specific surface priors guiding a stationary velocity field for biologically plausible deformations. Validation included 20 public Prostate-MRI-US-Biopsy cases and 10 institutional HDR cases, evaluated via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean surface distance (MSD), and 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95). Results: The proposed method achieved robust registration. For the public dataset, prostate DSC was $0.93 \pm 0.05$, MSD $0.87 \pm 0.10$ mm, and HD95 $1.58 \pm 0.37$ mm. For the institutional dataset, prostate CTV achieved DSC $0.88 \pm 0.09$, MSD $1.21 \pm 0.38$ mm, and HD95 $2.09 \pm 1.48$ mm. Bladder and rectum performance was lower due to ultrasound's limited field of view. Visual assessments confirmed accurate alignment with minimal discrepancies. Conclusion: This study introduces a novel weakly supervised SINR-based approach for 3D MRI-US deformable registration. By leveraging sparse surface supervision and spatial priors, it achieves accurate, robust, and computationally efficient registration, enhancing real-time image guidance in HDR prostate brachytherapy and improving treatment precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniMamba: Unified Spatial-Channel Representation Learning with Group-Efficient Mamba for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12009v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in LiDAR 3D detection have demonstrated the effectiveness of Transformer-based frameworks in capturing the global dependencies from point cloud spaces, which serialize the 3D voxels into the flattened 1D sequence for iterative self-attention. However, the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides, due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers, multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers, leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM) achieved in the field of 2D vision tasks, in this paper, we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba), which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner, aiming to perform "local and global" spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically, a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling, complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore, the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both "local and global" spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally, an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes, Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly, our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2025 |

To navigate safely, this understanding must be derived from sensor data in real-time and needs to be represented in vectorized form. Learned Bird's-Eye View (BEV) encoders are commonly used to combine a set of camera images from multiple views into one joint latent BEV grid. Traditionally, from this latent space, an intermediate raster map is predicted, providing dense spatial supervision but requiring post-processing into the desired vectorized form. More recent models directly derive infrastructure elements as polylines using vectorized map decoders, providing instance-level information. Our approach, Augmentation Map Network (AugMapNet), proposes latent BEV grid augmentation, a novel technique that significantly enhances the latent BEV representation. AugMapNet combines vector decoding and dense spatial supervision more effectively than existing architectures while remaining as straightforward to integrate and as generic as auxiliary supervision. Experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets demonstrate significant improvements in vectorized map prediction performance up to 13.3% over the StreamMapNet baseline on 60m range and greater improvements on larger ranges. We confirm transferability by applying our method to another baseline and find similar improvements. A detailed analysis of the latent BEV grid confirms a more structured latent space of AugMapNet and shows the value of our novel concept beyond pure performance improvement. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

In this work, we leverage large-scale high-quality 3D scene data with open-set annotations to introduce 1) a novel supervised fine-tuning dataset and 2) a new evaluation benchmark, focused on indoor scenes. Our Cubify Anything VQA (CA-VQA) data covers diverse spatial tasks including spatial relationship prediction, metric size and distance estimation, and 3D grounding. We show that CA-VQA enables us to train MM-Spatial, a strong generalist MLLM that also achieves state-of-the-art performance on 3D spatial understanding benchmarks, including our own. We show how incorporating metric depth and multi-view inputs (provided in CA-VQA) can further improve 3D understanding, and demonstrate that data alone allows our model to achieve depth perception capabilities comparable to dedicated monocular depth estimation models. We will publish our SFT dataset and benchmark.</p></details> |  |

More precisely, we consider a family of pre-trained convolutional filters and estimate deeply parametrized spatially varying parameters applied to the sparse feature maps by means of unrolling a FISTA algorithm to solve the underlying sparse estimation problem. The proposed approach is evaluated for image reconstruction of low-field MRI and compared to spatially adaptive and non-adaptive analysis-type procedures relying on Total Variation regularization and to a well-established model-based deep learning approach. We show that the proposed approach produces visually and quantitatively comparable results with the latter approaches and at the same time remains highly interpretable. In particular, the inferred parameter maps quantify the local contribution of each filter in the reconstruction, which provides valuable insight into the algorithm mechanism and could potentially be used to discard unsuited filters.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be submitted to the EUSIPCO 2025 conference</p></details> |

However, their limitations in fine-grained spatial reasoning pose challenges for system interpretability and user trust. We introduce Logic-RAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that improves LMMs' spatial understanding in driving scenarios. Logic-RAG constructs a dynamic knowledge base (KB) about object-object relationships in first-order logic (FOL) using a perception module, a query-to-logic embedder, and a logical inference engine. We evaluated Logic-RAG on visual-spatial queries using both synthetic and real-world driving videos. When using popular LMMs (GPT-4V, Claude 3.5) as proxies for an autonomous driving system, these models achieved only 55% accuracy on synthetic driving scenes and under 75% on real-world driving scenes. Augmenting them with Logic-RAG increased their accuracies to over 80% and 90%, respectively. An ablation study showed that even without logical inference, the fact-based context constructed by Logic-RAG alone improved accuracy by 15%. Logic-RAG is extensible: it allows seamless replacement of individual components with improved versions and enables domain experts to compose new knowledge in both FOL and natural language. In sum, Logic-RAG addresses critical spatial reasoning deficiencies in LMMs for autonomous driving applications.

By leveraging Foundation Models (FMs) for spatial reasoning and active view planning, our framework constructs and updates an instance-centric representation of spatial relationships, enhancing grasp success under challenging occlusions. Furthermore, this representation facilitates active Next-Best-View (NBV) planning and optimizes sequential grasping strategies when direct grasping is infeasible. Additionally, we introduce a multi-view uncertainty-driven grasp fusion mechanism that refines grasp confidence and directional uncertainty in real-time, ensuring robust and stable grasp execution. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrate that VISO-Grasp achieves a success rate of $87.5\%$ in target-oriented grasping with the fewest grasp attempts outperforming baselines. To the best of our knowledge, VISO-Grasp is the first unified framework integrating FMs into target-aware active view planning and 6-DoF grasping in environments with severe occlusions and entire invisibility constraints.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154v7)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D manipulation tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing GravMAD with more flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. Evaluations on real-world robotic tasks further show that GravMAD can reason about real-world tasks, associate them with relevant visual information, and generalize to novel tasks. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation.

Understanding three-dimensional (3D) spatial rotations can involve verbal descriptions and visual or interactive examples, illustrating how objects change orientation in 3D space. Recent studies show Artificial Intelligence (AI) with language and vision capabilities still face limitations in spatial reasoning. In this paper, we have studied generative AI's spatial capabilities of understanding rotations of objects utilizing its image and language processing features. We examined the spatial intelligence of the GPT-4 model with vision in understanding spatial rotation process with diagrams based on the Revised Purdue Spatial Visualization Test: Visualization of Rotations (Revised PSVT:R). Next, we incorporated a layer of coordinate system axes on Revised PSVT:R to study the variations in GPT-4's performance. We also examined GPT-4's understanding of 3D rotations in Augmented Reality (AR) scenes that visualize spatial rotations of an object in 3D space and observed increased accuracy of GPT-4's understanding of the rotations by adding supplementary textual information depicting the rotation process or mathematical representations of the rotation (e.g., matrices). The results indicate that while GPT-4 as a major current Generative AI model lacks the understanding of a spatial rotation process, it has the potential to understand the rotation process with additional information that can be provided by methods such as AR. By combining the potentials in spatial intelligence of AI with AR's interactive visualization abilities, we expect to offer enhanced guidance for students' spatial learning activities. Such spatial guidance can benefit understanding spatial transformations and additionally support processes like assembly, fabrication, and manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[PanDA: Towards Panoramic Depth Anything with Unlabeled Panoramas and Mobius Spatial Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13378v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Depth Anything Models (DAMs) - a type of depth foundation models - have demonstrated impressive zero-shot capabilities across diverse perspective images. Despite its success, it remains an open question regarding DAMs' performance on panorama images that enjoy a large field-of-view (180x360) but suffer from spherical distortions. To address this gap, we conduct an empirical analysis to evaluate the performance of DAMs on panoramic images and identify their limitations. For this, we undertake comprehensive experiments to assess the performance of DAMs from three key factors: panoramic representations, 360 camera positions for capturing scenarios, and spherical spatial transformations. This way, we reveal some key findings, e.g., DAMs are sensitive to spatial transformations. We then propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework to learn a panoramic DAM, dubbed PanDA. Under the umbrella of SSL, PanDA first learns a teacher model by fine-tuning DAM through joint training on synthetic indoor and outdoor panoramic datasets. Then, a student model is trained using large-scale unlabeled data, leveraging pseudo-labels generated by the teacher model. To enhance PanDA's generalization capability, M"obius transformation-based spatial augmentation (MTSA) is proposed to impose consistency regularization between the predicted depth maps from the original and spatially transformed ones. This subtly improves the student model's robustness to various spatial transformations, even under severe distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PanDA exhibits remarkable zero-shot capability across diverse scenes, and outperforms the data-specific panoramic depth estimation methods on two popular real-world benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 18 figures, accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

A common solution involves long-term temporal LiDAR data to densify the inputs. However, efficiently leveraging spatial-temporal information remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Fusion (ST-Fusion) method, which introduces a novel fusion module to relieve the spatial misalignment caused by the object motion over time and a feature-level semantic supervision to sufficiently unlock the capacity of the proposed fusion module. Specifically, the ST-Fusion consists of a Spatial Aggregation (SA) module and a Temporal Merging (TM) module. The SA module employs a convolutional layer with progressively expanding receptive fields to aggregate the object features from the local regions to alleviate the spatial misalignment, the TM module dynamically extracts object features from the preceding frames based on the attention mechanism for a comprehensive sequential presentation. Besides, in the semantic supervision, we propose a Semantic Injection method to enrich the sparse LiDAR data via injecting the point-wise semantic labels, using it for training a teacher model and providing a reconstruction target at the feature level supervised by the proposed object-aware loss. Extensive experiments on various LiDAR-based detectors demonstrate the effectiveness and universality of our proposal, yielding an improvement of approximately +2.8% in NDS based on the nuScenes benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ICRA2025 |

However, existing methods are limited to temporal localization of when the object is in its initial state (e.g., the unchopped avocado) versus when it has completed a state change (e.g., the chopped avocado), which limits applicability for any task requiring detailed information about the progress of the actions and its spatial localization. We propose to deepen the problem by introducing the spatially-progressing object state change segmentation task. The goal is to segment at the pixel-level those regions of an object that are actionable and those that are transformed. We introduce the first model to address this task, designing a VLM-based pseudo-labeling approach, state-change dynamics constraints, and a novel WhereToChange benchmark built on in-the-wild Internet videos. Experiments on two datasets validate both the challenge of the new task as well as the promise of our model for localizing exactly where and how fast objects are changing in video. We further demonstrate useful implications for tracking activity progress to benefit robotic agents.

Utilising a hierarchical spatiotemporal clustering methodology, we analyse yearly time series of emissions by gases and sectors from 1990 to 2022 for European regions at the NUTS-2 level. While the clustering algorithm inherently incorporates spatial information based on geographical distance, the extent to which space contributes to the definition of groups still requires further exploration. To address this gap in the literature, we propose a novel indicator, namely the Joint Inertia, which quantifies the contribution of spatial distances when integrated with other features. Through a simulation experiment, we explore the relationship between the Joint Inertia and the relevance of geography in exploiting the groups structure under several configurations of spatial and features patterns, providing insights into the behaviour and potential of the proposed indicator. The empirical findings demonstrate the relevance of the spatial component in identifying emission patterns and dynamics, and the results reveal significant heterogeneity across clusters in trends and dynamics by gases and sectors. This reflects the heterogeneous economic and industrial characteristics of European regions. The study highlights the importance of the spatial and temporal dimensions in understanding GHGs emissions, offering baseline insights for future spatiotemporal modelling and supporting more targeted and regionally informed environmental policies.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing such data introduces spatial dependence among the health outcomes and seeks to report statistically significant spatial disparities by delineating boundaries that separate neighboring regions with disparate health outcomes. However, there are statistical challenges to appropriately defining what constitutes a spatial disparity and to construct robust probabilistic inference for spatial disparities. We enrich the familiar Bayesian linear regression framework to introduce spatial autoregression and offer model-based detection of spatial disparities. We derive exploitable analytical tractability that considerably accelerates computation. Simulation experiments conducted over a county map of the entire United States demonstrate the effectiveness of our method and we apply our method to a data set from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) on age-standardized US county-level estimates of lung cancer mortality rates.</p></details> | 55 pages, 9 figures |

Implicitly infusing the spatial geometric prior knowledge acquired by a data-fusion teacher network into a single-modal student network is a practical, albeit less explored research avenue. This article delves into this topic and resorts to knowledge distillation approaches to address this problem. We introduce the Learning to Infuse ''X'' (LIX) framework, with novel contributions in both logit distillation and feature distillation aspects. We present a mathematical proof that underscores the limitation of using a single, fixed weight in decoupled knowledge distillation and introduce a logit-wise dynamic weight controller as a solution to this issue. Furthermore, we develop an adaptively-recalibrated feature distillation algorithm, including two novel techniques: feature recalibration via kernel regression and in-depth feature consistency quantification via centered kernel alignment. Extensive experiments conducted with intermediate-fusion and late-fusion networks across various public datasets provide both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, demonstrating the superior performance of our LIX framework when compared to other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel benchmark, Open3DVQA, to comprehensively evaluate the spatial reasoning capacities of current state-of-the-art (SOTA) foundation models in open 3D space. Open3DVQA consists of 9k VQA samples, collected using an efficient semi-automated tool in a high-fidelity urban simulator. We evaluate several SOTA MLLMs across various aspects of spatial reasoning, such as relative and absolute spatial relationships, situational reasoning, and object-centric spatial attributes. Our results reveal that: 1) MLLMs perform better at answering questions regarding relative spatial relationships than absolute spatial relationships, 2) MLLMs demonstrate similar spatial reasoning abilities for both egocentric and allocentric perspectives, and 3) Fine-tuning large models significantly improves their performance across different spatial reasoning tasks. We believe that our open-source data collection tools and in-depth analyses will inspire further research on MLLM spatial reasoning capabilities.

To address this gap, we propose EmbodiedVSR (Embodied Visual Spatial Reasoning), a novel framework that integrates dynamic scene graph-guided Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to enhance spatial understanding for embodied agents. By explicitly constructing structured knowledge representations through dynamic scene graphs, our method enables zero-shot spatial reasoning without task-specific fine-tuning. This approach not only disentangles intricate spatial relationships but also aligns reasoning steps with actionable environmental dynamics. To rigorously evaluate performance, we introduce the eSpatial-Benchmark, a comprehensive dataset including real-world embodied scenarios with fine-grained spatial annotations and adaptive task difficulty levels. Experiments demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing MLLM-based methods in accuracy and reasoning coherence, particularly in long-horizon tasks requiring iterative environment interaction. The results reveal the untapped potential of MLLMs for embodied intelligence when equipped with structured, explainable reasoning mechanisms, paving the way for more reliable deployment in real-world spatial applications. The codes and datasets will be released soon.</p></details> | technical report |

| **[Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Modeling Spatial-temporal Multi-scales in Molecular Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting long-horizon molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories remains a significant challenge, as existing deep learning methods often struggle to retain fidelity over extended simulations. We hypothesize that one key factor limiting accuracy is the difficulty of capturing interactions that span distinct spatial and temporal scales-ranging from high-frequency local vibrations to low-frequency global conformational changes. To address these limitations, we propose Graph Fourier Neural ODEs (GF-NODE), integrating a graph Fourier transform for spatial frequency decomposition with a Neural ODE framework for continuous-time evolution. Specifically, GF-NODE first decomposes molecular configurations into multiple spatial frequency modes using the graph Laplacian, then evolves the frequency components in time via a learnable Neural ODE module that captures both local and global dynamics, and finally reconstructs the updated molecular geometry through an inverse graph Fourier transform. By explicitly modeling high- and low-frequency phenomena in this unified pipeline, GF-NODE more effectively captures long-range correlations and local fluctuations alike. Experimental results on challenging MD benchmarks, including MD17 and alanine dipeptide, demonstrate that GF-NODE achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while preserving essential geometrical features over extended simulations. These findings highlight the promise of bridging spectral decomposition with continuous-time modeling to improve the robustness and predictive power of MD simulations.</p></details> | Preprint |

Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-VLM: Kinematic Instruction Tuning for Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19355v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal reasoning is essential in understanding real-world environments in various fields, eg, autonomous driving and sports analytics. Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13059v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modeling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling.

However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation.

| **[Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16639v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copula-based spatio-temporal modeling of air pollutant data incorporating covariate dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15935v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elevated levels of PM10 are known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and, in extreme cases, cancer and mortality. Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockDance: Reuse Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal Features to Accelerate Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15927v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field. Our project is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/12345-DFCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Infant Language Acquisition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14341v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpaceVLLM: Endowing Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13983v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made remarkable progress in either temporal or spatial localization. However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Omnidirectional Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11506v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnidirectional video (ODV) provides an immersive visual experience and is widely utilized in virtual reality and augmented reality. However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human-Centric Video Anomaly Detection Through Spatio-Temporal Pose Tokenization and Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15185v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) presents a significant challenge in computer vision, particularly due to the unpredictable and infrequent nature of anomalous events, coupled with the diverse and dynamic environments in which they occur. Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Our approach applies query-based detection (DETR) to each frame and matches DETR queries to link the same person across frames. We introduce the Query Matching Module (QMM), which uses metric learning to bring queries for the same person closer together across frames compared to queries for different people. Action classes are predicted using the sequence of queries obtained from QMM matching, allowing for variable-length inputs from videos longer than a single clip. Experimental results on JHMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets demonstrate that our method performs well for large position changes of people while offering superior computational efficiency and lower resource requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>exten...</summary><p>extended version of VISAPP2025</p></details> |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

Such data occurs widely, ranging from the scientific and medical domains to the industrial and environmental domains. When the properties in time series exhibit spatial variations, we often call the data spatio-temporal. As part of the continued digitalization of processes throughout society, increasingly large volumes of time series and spatio-temporal data are available. In this tutorial, we focus on data-driven decision making with such data, e.g., enabling greener and more efficient transportation based on traffic time series forecasting. The tutorial adopts the holistic paradigm of "data-governance-analytics-decision." We first introduce the data foundation of time series and spatio-temporal data, which is often heterogeneous. Next, we discuss data governance methods that aim to improve data quality. We then cover data analytics, focusing on five desired characteristics: automation, robustness, generality, explainability, and resource efficiency. We finally cover data-driven decision making strategies and briefly discuss promising research directions. We hope that the tutorial will serve as a primary resource for researchers and practitioners who are interested in value creation from time series and spatio-temporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal Fourier Transformer (StFT) for Long-term Dynamics Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11899v1)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating the long-term dynamics of multi-scale and multi-physics systems poses a significant challenge in understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. The complexity arises from the intricate interactions between scales and the interplay of diverse physical processes. Neural operators have emerged as promising models for predicting such dynamics due to their flexibility and computational efficiency. However, they often fail to effectively capture multi-scale interactions or quantify the uncertainties inherent in the predictions. These limitations lead to rapid error accumulation, particularly in long-term forecasting of systems characterized by complex and coupled dynamics. To address these challenges, we propose a spatio-temporal Fourier transformer (StFT), in which each transformer block is designed to learn dynamics at a specific scale. By leveraging a structured hierarchy of StFT blocks, the model explicitly captures dynamics across both macro- and micro- spatial scales. Furthermore, a generative residual correction mechanism is integrated to estimate and mitigate predictive uncertainties, enhancing both the accuracy and reliability of long-term forecasts. Evaluations conducted on three benchmark datasets (plasma, fluid, and atmospheric dynamics) demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art ML methods.</p></details> | 16 pages, 10 figures |

However, can Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) also "reason through a sequential spatio-temporal logic" in videos? Existing Video-LLM benchmarks primarily focus on assessing object presence, neglecting relational reasoning. Consequently, it is difficult to measure whether a model truly comprehends object interactions (actions/events) in videos or merely relies on pre-trained "memory" of co-occurrences as biases in generating answers. In this work, we introduce a Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (V-STaR) benchmark to address these shortcomings. The key idea is to decompose video understanding into a Reverse Spatio-Temporal Reasoning (RSTR) task that simultaneously evaluates what objects are present, when events occur, and where they are located while capturing the underlying Chain-of-thought (CoT) logic. To support this evaluation, we construct a dataset to elicit the spatial-temporal reasoning process of Video-LLMs. It contains coarse-to-fine CoT questions generated by a semi-automated GPT-4-powered pipeline, embedding explicit reasoning chains to mimic human cognition. Experiments from 14 Video-LLMs on our V-STaR reveal significant gaps between current Video-LLMs and the needs for robust and consistent spatio-temporal reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>A ben...</summary><p>A benchmark for Video Spatio-Temporal Reasoning</p></details> |

Nevertheless, conventional Mamba-based models encounter significant challenges in accurately predicting stock time series, as they fail to adequately capture both the overarching market dynamics and the intricate interdependencies among individual stocks. To overcome these constraints, we introduce the Hierarchical Information-Guided Spatio-Temporal Mamba (HIGSTM) framework. HIGSTM introduces Index-Guided Frequency Filtering Decomposition to extract commonality and specificity from time series. The model architecture features a meticulously designed hierarchical framework that systematically captures both temporal dynamic patterns and global static relationships within the stock market. Furthermore, we propose an Information-Guided Mamba that integrates macro informations into the sequence selection process, thereby facilitating more market-conscious decision-making. Comprehensive experimental evaluations conducted on the CSI500, CSI800 and CSI1000 datasets demonstrate that HIGSTM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Prior work primarily focuses on single-frame cooperative perception, which fuses agents' information across different spatial locations but ignores temporal cues and temporal tasks (e.g., temporal perception and prediction). In this paper, we focus on the spatio-temporal fusion in V2X scenarios and design one-step and multi-step communication strategies (when to transmit) as well as examine their integration with three fusion strategies - early, late, and intermediate (what to transmit), providing comprehensive benchmarks with 11 fusion models (how to fuse). Furthermore, we propose V2XPnP, a novel intermediate fusion framework within one-step communication for end-to-end perception and prediction. Our framework employs a unified Transformer-based architecture to effectively model complex spatio-temporal relationships across multiple agents, frames, and high-definition map. Moreover, we introduce the V2XPnP Sequential Dataset that supports all V2X collaboration modes and addresses the limitations of existing real-world datasets, which are restricted to single-frame or single-mode cooperation. Extensive experiments demonstrate our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perception and prediction tasks.

Compared to classic STVG locating only a single target, OmniSTVG enables localization of not only an arbitrary number of text-referred targets but also their interacting counterparts in the query from the video, making it more flexible and practical in real scenarios for comprehensive understanding. In order to facilitate exploration of OmniSTVG, we introduce BOSTVG, a large-scale benchmark dedicated to OmniSTVG. Specifically, our BOSTVG consists of 10,018 videos with 10.2M frames and covers a wide selection of 287 classes from diverse scenarios. Each sequence in BOSTVG, paired with a free-form textual query, encompasses a varying number of targets ranging from 1 to 10. To ensure high quality, each video is manually annotated with meticulous inspection and refinement. To our best knowledge, BOSTVG is to date the first and the largest benchmark for OmniSTVG. To encourage future research, we introduce a simple yet effective approach, named OmniTube, which, drawing inspiration from Transformer-based STVG methods, is specially designed for OmniSTVG and demonstrates promising results. By releasing BOSTVG, we hope to go beyond classic STVG by locating every object appearing in the query for more comprehensive understanding, opening up a new direction for STVG.

Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy for Air Quality Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09646v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of sensors for air quality monitoring is constrained by high costs, leading to inadequate network coverage and data deficits in some areas. Utilizing existing observations, spatio-temporal kriging is a method for estimating air quality at unobserved locations during a specific period. Inductive spatio-temporal kriging with increment training strategy has demonstrated its effectiveness using virtual nodes to simulate unobserved nodes. However, a disparity between virtual and real nodes persists, complicating the application of learning patterns derived from virtual nodes to actual unobserved ones. To address these limitations, this paper presents a Physics-Guided Increment Training Strategy (PGITS). Specifically, we design a dynamic graph generation module to incorporate the advection and diffusion processes of airborne particles as physical knowledge into the graph structure, dynamically adjusting the adjacency matrix to reflect physical interactions between nodes. By using physics principles as a bridge between virtual and real nodes, this strategy ensures the features of virtual nodes and their pseudo labels are closer to actual nodes. Consequently, the learned patterns of virtual nodes can be applied to actual unobserved nodes for effective kriging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[STGDPM:Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Spatio-Temporal Graph Diffusion Probabilistic Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08065v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vessel trajectory prediction is a critical component for ensuring maritime traffic safety and avoiding collisions. Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |
| **[STEAD: Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection for Time and Compute Sensitive Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07942v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new method for anomaly detection in automated systems with time and compute sensitive requirements, such as autonomous driving, with unparalleled efficiency. As systems like autonomous driving become increasingly popular, ensuring their safety has become more important than ever. Therefore, this paper focuses on how to quickly and effectively detect various anomalies in the aforementioned systems, with the goal of making them safer and more effective. Many detection systems have been developed with great success under spatial contexts; however, there is still significant room for improvement when it comes to temporal context. While there is substantial work regarding this task, there is minimal work done regarding the efficiency of models and their ability to be applied to scenarios that require real-time inference, i.e., autonomous driving where anomalies need to be detected the moment they are within view. To address this gap, we propose STEAD (Spatio-Temporal Efficient Anomaly Detection), whose backbone is developed using (2+1)D Convolutions and Performer Linear Attention, which ensures computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. When tested on the UCF-Crime benchmark, our base model achieves an AUC of 91.34%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art, and our fast version achieves an AUC of 88.87%, while having 99.70% less parameters and outperforming the previous state-of-the-art as well.

Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Reversal Regularization for Spiking Neural Networks: Hybrid Spatio-Temporal Invariance for Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v3)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have shown that SNNs suffer from severe overfitting, which limits their generalization performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Temporal Reversal Regularization (TRR) to mitigate overfitting during training and facilitate generalization of SNNs. We exploit the inherent temporal properties of SNNs to perform input/feature temporal reversal perturbations, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and learn perturbation-invariant representations. To further enhance generalization, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (Hadamard product) for feature hybridization of original and temporally reversed spike firing rates, which expands the implicit dimensionality and acts as a spatio-temporal regularizer. We show theoretically that our method is able to tighten the upper bound of the generalization error, and extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic recognition as well as 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate its effectiveness, versatility, and adversarial robustness. In particular, our regularization significantly improves the recognition accuracy of low-latency SNN for neuromorphic objects, contributing to the real-world deployment of neuromorphic computational software-hardware integration.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v4)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[DropletVideo: A Dataset and Approach to Explore Integral Spatio-Temporal Consistent Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06053v1)** | 2025-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal consistency is a critical research topic in video generation. A qualified generated video segment must ensure plot plausibility and coherence while maintaining visual consistency of objects and scenes across varying viewpoints. Prior research, especially in open-source projects, primarily focuses on either temporal or spatial consistency, or their basic combination, such as appending a description of a camera movement after a prompt without constraining the outcomes of this movement. However, camera movement may introduce new objects to the scene or eliminate existing ones, thereby overlaying and affecting the preceding narrative. Especially in videos with numerous camera movements, the interplay between multiple plots becomes increasingly complex. This paper introduces and examines integral spatio-temporal consistency, considering the synergy between plot progression and camera techniques, and the long-term impact of prior content on subsequent generation. Our research encompasses dataset construction through to the development of the model. Initially, we constructed a DropletVideo-10M dataset, which comprises 10 million videos featuring dynamic camera motion and object actions. Each video is annotated with an average caption of 206 words, detailing various camera movements and plot developments. Following this, we developed and trained the DropletVideo model, which excels in preserving spatio-temporal coherence during video generation. The DropletVideo dataset and model are accessible at https://dropletx.github.io.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding the predictions from a model is crucial to ensure reliability and trustworthiness, particularly for high-risk applications, such as healthcare and transport. Few existing methods are able to generate explanations for models trained on continuous-time dynamic graph data and, of these, the computational complexity and lack of suitable explanation objectives pose challenges. In this paper, we propose $\textbf{S}$patio-$\textbf{T}$emporal E$\textbf{X}$planation $\textbf{Search}$ (STX-Search), a novel method for generating instance-level explanations that is applicable to static and dynamic temporal graph structures. We introduce a novel search strategy and objective function, to find explanations that are highly faithful and interpretable. When compared with existing methods, STX-Search produces explanations of higher fidelity whilst optimising explanation size to maintain interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

State-of-the-art association methods in agriculture are dedicated towards matching larger crops using either high-resolution point clouds or temporally stable features, which are both difficult to obtain for smaller fruit in the field. To address these challenges, we propose a transformer-based architecture that encodes the shape and position of each fruitlet, and propagates and refines these features through a series of transformer encoder layers with alternating self and cross-attention. We demonstrate that our method is able to achieve an F1-score of 92.4% on data collected in a commercial apple orchard and outperforms all baselines and ablations.</p></details> |  |

The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. A computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism has recently been shown to exhibit superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. Our investigation reveals significant challenges related to stability and parameterization when employing the conventional Euler-Forward discretization for this class of models. We report a rigorous theoretical and empirical demonstration that these challenges can be effectively addressed by adopting an alternative discretization approach - the Symplectic Euler method, allowing to improve over state-of-the-art performances on common event-based benchmark datasets. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences without any normalization techniques.</p></details> |  |

Here we present new generally applicable methodology to perform this task. We introduce a parsimonious representation of seasonality and a biologically informed specification of the outbreak component to avoid parameter identifiability issues. We develop a computationally efficient Bayesian inference methodology for the proposed models, including techniques to detect outbreaks by computing marginal posterior probabilities at each spatial location and time point. We show that it is possible to efficiently integrate out the discrete parameters associated with outbreak states, enabling the use of dynamic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as a complementary alternative to a hybrid Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Furthermore, we introduce a robust Bayesian model comparison framework based on importance sampling to approximate model evidence in high-dimensional space. The performance of our methodology is validated through systematic simulation studies, where simulated outbreaks were successfully detected, and our model comparison strategy demonstrates strong reliability. We also apply our new methodology to monthly incidence data on invasive meningococcal disease from 28 European countries. The results highlight outbreaks across multiple countries and months, with model comparison analysis showing that the new specification outperforms previous approaches.

To achieve this goal, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Memory Agent (STMA), a novel framework designed to enhance task planning and execution by integrating spatio-temporal memory. STMA is built upon three critical components: (1) a spatio-temporal memory module that captures historical and environmental changes in real time, (2) a dynamic knowledge graph that facilitates adaptive spatial reasoning, and (3) a planner-critic mechanism that iteratively refines task strategies. We evaluate STMA in the TextWorld environment on 32 tasks, involving multi-step planning and exploration under varying levels of complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that STMA achieves a 31.25% improvement in success rate and a 24.7% increase in average score compared to the state-of-the-art model. The results highlight the effectiveness of spatio-temporal memory in advancing the memory capabilities of embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by recent advances in vision-language foundation models, we investigate their utility for WSTVG, leveraging their zero-shot grounding capabilities. However, we find that a simple adaptation lacks essential spatio-temporal grounding abilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce Tubelet Referral Grounding (TRG), which connects textual queries to tubelets to enable spatio-temporal predictions. Despite its promise, TRG struggles with compositional action understanding and dense scene scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose STPro, a novel progressive learning framework with two key modules: (1) Sub-Action Temporal Curriculum Learning (SA-TCL), which incrementally builds compositional action understanding, and (2) Congestion-Guided Spatial Curriculum Learning (CG-SCL), which adapts the model to complex scenes by spatially increasing task difficulty. STPro achieves state-of-the-art results on three benchmark datasets, with improvements of 1.0% on VidSTG-Declarative and 3.0% on HCSTVG-v1.</p></details> | CVPR'25 Conference |

To address these limitations, this paper presents the Spatio-Temporal GraphFormer framework (STGFormer) for 3D human pose estimation in videos. First, we introduce a Spatio-Temporal criss-cross Graph (STG) attention mechanism, designed to more effectively leverage the inherent graph priors of the human body within continuous sequence distributions while capturing spatiotemporal long-range dependencies. Next, we present a dual-path Modulated Hop-wise Regular GCN (MHR-GCN) to independently process temporal and spatial dimensions in parallel, preserving features rich in temporal dynamics and the original or high-dimensional representations of spatial structures. Furthermore, the module leverages modulation to optimize parameter efficiency and incorporates spatiotemporal hop-wise skip connections to capture higher-order information. Finally, we demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Human3.6M and MPIINF-3DHP datasets.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Hierarchical Federated Learning Transformer Network (H-FLTN) framework to address these challenges. H-FLTN employs a three-tier hierarchical architecture comprising EVs, community Distributed Energy Resource Management Systems (DERMS), and the Energy Provider Data Centre (EPDC) to enable accurate spatio-temporal predictions of EV charging needs while preserving privacy. Temporal prediction is enhanced using Transformer-based learning, capturing complex dependencies in charging behavior. Privacy is ensured through Secure Aggregation, Additive Secret Sharing, and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Sharing with Augmentation, which allow only secret shares of model weights to be exchanged while securing all transmissions. To improve training efficiency and resource management, H-FLTN integrates Dynamic Client Capping Mechanism (DCCM) and Client Rotation Management (CRM), ensuring that training remains both computationally and temporally efficient as the number of participating EVs increases. DCCM optimises client participation by limiting excessive computational loads, while CRM balances training contributions across epochs, preventing imbalanced participation. Our simulation results based on large-scale empirical vehicle mobility data reveal that DCCM and CRM reduce the training time complexity with increasing EVs from linear to constant. Its integration into real-world smart city infrastructure enhances energy demand forecasting, resource allocation, and grid stability, ensuring reliability and sustainability in future mobility ecosystems.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 tables, 2 figures, Journal Paper</p></details> |

Recently, advancements in monitoring technology have facilitated the effective recording of nuclear radiation levels and related factors, such as weather conditions. The abundance of monitoring data enables the development of accurate and reliable nuclear radiation forecasting models, which play a crucial role in informing decision-making for individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, a novel framework tailored for the nationwide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation.

However, traditional approaches to assess patient actions often rely on manual observation and scoring, which are subjective and time-consuming. In this paper, we propose an automated approach for patient action assessment using a Multi-Residual Spatio Temporal Graph Network (MR-STGN) that incorporates both angular and positional 3D skeletons. The MR-STGN is specifically designed to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of patient actions. It achieves this by integrating information from multiple residual layers, with each layer extracting features at distinct levels of abstraction. Furthermore, we integrate an attention fusion mechanism into the network, which facilitates the adaptive weighting of various features. This empowers the model to concentrate on the most pertinent aspects of the patient's movements, offering precise instructions regarding specific body parts or movements that require attention. Ablation studies are conducted to analyze the impact of individual components within the proposed model.

However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 figures |

However, most approaches are based on the assumption of the availability of and accessibility to a sufficiently dense data source, which is rather the rare case in reality. Traffic sensors in road networks are generally highly sparse in their distribution: fleet-based traffic sensing is sparse in space but also sparse in time. There are also other traffic application, besides road traffic, like moving objects in the marine space, where observations are sparsely and arbitrarily distributed in space. In this paper, we tackle the problem of traffic prediction on sparse and spatially irregular and non-deterministic traffic observations. We draw a border between imputations and this work as we consider high sparsity rates and no fixed sensor locations. We advance correlation mining methods with a Sparse Unstructured Spatio Temporal Reconstruction (SUSTeR) framework that reconstructs traffic states from sparse non-stationary observations. For the prediction the framework creates a hidden context traffic state which is enriched in a residual fashion with each observation. Such an assimilated hidden traffic state can be used by existing traffic prediction methods to predict future traffic states. We query these states with query locations from the spatial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and presented at ACM SIGSPATIAL '23</p></details> |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge.

| **[Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v5)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which are then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

With around 2000 ball events per game, their precise and exhaustive annotation based on a monocular video stream remains a tedious and costly manual task. While state-of-the-art spatio-temporal action detection methods show promise for automating this task, they lack contextual understanding of the game. Assuming professional players' behaviors are interdependent, we hypothesize that incorporating surrounding players' information such as positions, velocity and team membership can enhance purely visual predictions. We propose a spatio-temporal action detection approach that combines visual and game state information via Graph Neural Networks trained end-to-end with state-of-the-art 3D CNNs, demonstrating improved metrics through game state integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15296v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning, where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph. We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over a large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the limiting dynamics of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part I: A Metric for Spatio-Temporal Trajectory Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15842v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of target tracking, performance evaluation plays a pivotal role in the design, comparison, and analytics of trackers. Compared with the traditional trajectory composed of a set of point-estimates obtained by a tracker in the measurement time-series, the trajectory that our series of studies including this paper pursued is given by a curve function of time (FoT). The trajectory FoT provides complete information of the movement of the target over time and can be used to infer the state corresponding to arbitrary time, not only at the measurement time. However, there are no metrics available for comparing and evaluating the trajectory FoT. To address this lacuna, we propose a metric denominated as the spatiotemporal-aligned trajectory integral distance (Star-ID). The StarID associates and aligns the estimated and actual trajectories in the spatio-temporal domain and distinguishes between the time-aligned and unaligned segments in calculating the spatial divergence including false alarm, miss-detection and localization errors. The effectiveness of the proposed distance metric and the time-averaged version is validated through theoretical analysis and numerical examples of a single target or multiple targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part I of a series of companion papers; 11 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the gold standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> | Published by TMI |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

They primarily emphasize temporal sharing while overlooking spatial and spectral dimensions. We propose an adaptive, AI-driven spectrum-sharing framework within the O-RAN architecture, integrating discriminative and generative AI (GenAI) to forecast spectrum needs across multiple timescales and spatial granularities. A marketplace model, managed by an authorized spectrum broker, enables operators to trade spectrum dynamically, balancing static assignments with real-time trading. GenAI enhances traffic prediction, spectrum estimation, and allocation, optimizing utilization while reducing costs. This modular, flexible approach fosters operator collaboration, maximizing efficiency and revenue. A key research challenge is refining allocation granularity and spatio-temporal dynamics beyond existing models.</p></details> |  |

Discretization in space is based on the theory of geometric quantization, which yields a spatially discretized analogue of the MHD equations as a finite-dimensional Lie--Poisson system on the dual of the magnetic extension Lie algebra $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{su}(N)\ltimes\mathfrak{su}(N)^{*}$. We also give accompanying structure preserving time discretizations for Lie--Poisson systems on the dual of semi-direct product Lie algebras of the form $\mathfrak{f}=\mathfrak{g}\ltimes\mathfrak{g^{*}}$, where $\mathfrak{g}$ is a $J$-quadratic Lie algebra. The time integration method is free of computationally costly matrix exponentials. We prove that the full method preserves a modified Lie--Poisson structure and corresponding Casimir functions, and that the modified structure and Casimirs converge to the continuous ones. The method is demonstrated for two models of magnetic fluids: incompressible magnetohydrodynamics and Hazeltine's model.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, convergence results for Casimirs added in sect. 3, typos corrected</p></details> |

We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future. AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression. We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation, such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis. Extensive experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental dynamics, especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability are critical.</p></details> |  |

Existing spatio-temporal data secure retrieval schemes have significant shortcomings regarding dynamic updates, either compromising privacy through leakage during updates (forward insecurity) or incurring excessively high update costs that hinder practical application. Under these circumstances, we first propose a basic filter-based spatio-temporal range query scheme \TrinityI that supports low-cost dynamic updates and automatic expansion. Furthermore, to improve security, reduce storage cost, and false positives, we propose a forward secure and verifiable scheme \TrinityII that simultaneously minimizes storage overhead. A formal security analysis proves that \TrinityI and \TrinityII are Indistinguishable under Selective Chosen-Plaintext Attack (IND-SCPA). Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our design \TrinityII significantly reduces storage requirements by 80\%, enables data retrieval at the 1 million-record level in just 0.01 seconds, and achieves 10 $\times$ update efficiency than state-of-art.</p></details> | 14pages,6 figures |
| **[Deepfake Detection with Spatio-Temporal Consistency and Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08216v1)** | 2025-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deepfake videos are causing growing concerns among communities due to their ever-increasing realism. Naturally, automated detection of forged Deepfake videos is attracting a proportional amount of interest of researchers. Current methods for detecting forged videos mainly rely on global frame features and under-utilize the spatio-temporal inconsistencies found in the manipulated videos. Moreover, they fail to attend to manipulation-specific subtle and well-localized pattern variations along both spatial and temporal dimensions. Addressing these gaps, we propose a neural Deepfake detector that focuses on the localized manipulative signatures of the forged videos at individual frame level as well as frame sequence level. Using a ResNet backbone, it strengthens the shallow frame-level feature learning with a spatial attention mechanism. The spatial stream of the model is further helped by fusing texture enhanced shallow features with the deeper features. Simultaneously, the model processes frame sequences with a distance attention mechanism that further allows fusion of temporal attention maps with the learned features at the deeper layers. The overall model is trained to detect forged content as a classifier. We evaluate our method on two popular large data sets and achieve significant performance over the state-of-the-art methods.Moreover, our technique also provides memory and computational advantages over the competitive techniques.</p></details> |  |

Full-scale resolving simulations for systems such as highly turbulent flows are not feasible in the foreseeable future, and reduced-order models must capture dynamics that involve interactions across scales. In the present work, we propose a novel framework, Graph-based Learning of Effective Dynamics (Graph-LED), that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs), as well as an attention-based autoregressive model, to extract the effective dynamics from a small amount of simulation data. GNNs represent flow fields on unstructured meshes as graphs and effectively handle complex geometries and non-uniform grids. The proposed method combines a GNN based, dimensionality reduction for variable-size unstructured meshes with an autoregressive temporal attention model that can learn temporal dependencies automatically. We evaluated the proposed approach on a suite of fluid dynamics problems, including flow past a cylinder and flow over a backward-facing step over a range of Reynolds numbers. The results demonstrate robust and effective forecasting of spatio-temporal physics; in the case of the flow past a cylinder, both small-scale effects that occur close to the cylinder as well as its wake are accurately captured.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Parsimony and Learning (CPAL)</p></details> |

In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress. Finally, we explore potential opportunities and directions to advance research towards the aim of effective and broadly applicable STFMs.</p></details> |  |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Species Distribution Models (SDMs) often suffer from spatial autocorrelation (SAC), leading to biased performance estimates. We tested cross-validation (CV) strategies - random splits, spatial blocking with varied distances, environmental (ENV) clustering, and a novel spatio-temporal method - under two proposed training schemes: LAST FOLD, widely used in spatial CV at the cost of data loss, and RETRAIN, which maximizes data usage but risks reintroducing SAC. LAST FOLD consistently yielded lower errors and stronger correlations. Spatial blocking at an optimal distance (SP 422) and ENV performed best, achieving Spearman and Pearson correlations of 0.485 and 0.548, respectively, although ENV may be unsuitable for long-term forecasts involving major environmental shifts. A spatio-temporal approach yielded modest benefits in our moderately variable dataset, but may excel with stronger temporal changes. These findings highlight the need to align CV approaches with the spatial and temporal structure of SDM data, ensuring rigorous validation and reliable predictive outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |

Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

| **[Spatio-temporal characterisation of underwater noise through semantic trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11131v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater noise pollution from human activities, particularly shipping, has been recognised as a serious threat to marine life. The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Event Prediction with Self-adaptive Anchor Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08653v2)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event prediction tasks often handle spatio-temporal data distributed in a large spatial area. Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM'25)</p></details> |
| **[Decomposing and Fusing Intra- and Inter-Sensor Spatio-Temporal Signal for Multi-Sensor Wearable Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10917v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable Human Activity Recognition (WHAR) is a prominent research area within ubiquitous computing. Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. Our codes and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Anakin2555/DecomposeWHAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vulnerability-Aware Spatio-Temporal Learning for Generalizable and Interpretable Deepfake Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01184v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting deepfake videos is highly challenging due to the complex intertwined spatial and temporal artifacts in forged sequences. Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Get Rid of Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> | 11 |

However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Small perturbations in conditions can often lead to significant changes in fire spread (such as speed and direction), necessitating a computationally expensive large set of simulations to quantify uncertainty. Model emulation seeks alternative representations of physical models using machine learning, aiming to provide more efficient and/or simplified surrogate models. We propose a dedicated spatio-temporal neural network based framework for model emulation, able to capture the complex behaviour of fire spread models. The proposed approach can approximate forecasts at fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are often challenging for neural network based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is robust even with small training sets, due to novel data augmentation methods. Empirical experiments show good agreement between simulated and emulated firefronts, with an average Jaccard score of 0.76.</p></details> |  |

Simultaneously, increasing LMs' "thinking" time through scaling test-time compute has proven an effective technique to solve challenging problems in domains such as math and code. This raises a natural question: can an LM's evaluation capability also be improved by spending more test-time compute? To answer this, we investigate employing reasoning models-LMs that natively generate long chain-of-thought reasoning-as evaluators. Specifically, we examine methods to leverage more test-time compute by (1) using reasoning models, and (2) prompting these models to evaluate not only the response as a whole (i.e., outcome evaluation) but also assess each step in the response separately (i.e., process evaluation). In experiments, we observe that the evaluator's performance improves monotonically when generating more reasoning tokens, similar to the trends observed in LM-based generation. Furthermore, we use these more accurate evaluators to rerank multiple generations, and demonstrate that spending more compute at evaluation time can be as effective as using more compute at generation time in improving an LM's problem-solving capability.</p></details> | Work in progress |

This has opened the possibility of natively supporting HPC in diffused realities, like industry or academic labs. At the same time, the Parallel Discrete Event Simulation (PDES) area has given rise to attractive simulation engines, designed with orientation to high performance and scalability, also targeting differentiated exploitation of the specific support offered by the underlying hardware. In this article, we present an experimental study where we deploy two last-generation open-source PDES platforms -- one optimistic (USE) and one conservative (PARSIR) -- on top of two significantly different hardware chipsets based on either {\sf x86} CISC or {\sf powerPC} RISC technology, both offering multiple Non-Uniform-Memory-Access (NUMA) nodes and multiple tens of cores and hardware-threads (logical CPUs). Also, we consider real-world simulation models configured in a variety of different manners in order to investigate the actual execution profile of the PDES engines on the two distinct hardware platforms. Our objective is the one of providing insights on current performance trends, which can support decisions in terms of both strategies -- for software platforms to adopt -- and investments -- in terms of hardware platforms -- in the area of discrete event simulation.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, current models are constrained by limitations in handling long texts and reinforcement learning (RL) training efficiency. To address these issues, we propose a simple yet effective test-time scaling approach Multi-round Thinking. This method iteratively refines model reasoning by leveraging previous answers as prompts for subsequent rounds. Extensive experiments across multiple models, including QwQ-32B and DeepSeek-R1, consistently show performance improvements on various benchmarks such as AIME 2024, MATH-500, GPQA-diamond, and LiveCodeBench. For instance, the accuracy of QwQ-32B improved from 80.3% (Round 1) to 82.1% (Round 2) on the AIME 2024 dataset, while DeepSeek-R1 showed a similar increase from 79.7% to 82.0%. These results confirm that Multi-round Thinking is a broadly applicable, straightforward approach to achieving stable enhancements in model performance, underscoring its potential for future developments in test-time scaling techniques.

In survival analysis, recent advances of DNNs primarily focus on enhancing model capabilities, especially in exploring nonlinear covariate effects under right censoring. However, deep learning methods for interval-censored data, where the unobservable failure time is only known to lie in an interval, remain underexplored and limited to specific data type or model. This work proposes a general regression framework for interval-censored data with a broad class of partially linear transformation models, where key covariate effects are modeled parametrically while nonlinear effects of nuisance multi-modal covariates are approximated via DNNs, balancing interpretability and flexibility. We employ sieve maximum likelihood estimation by leveraging monotone splines to approximate the cumulative baseline hazard function. To ensure reliable and tractable estimation, we develop an EM algorithm incorporating stochastic gradient descent. We establish the asymptotic properties of parameter estimators and show that the DNN estimator achieves minimax-optimal convergence. Extensive simulations demonstrate superior estimation and prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. Applying our method to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset yields novel insights and improved predictive performance compared to traditional approaches.</p></details> |  |

The elimination technique also works for a companion second-order path quantifier, which makes quantified path variables range over sets of plays that are closed under preference-indiscernibility. We argue that the preference operator and the specialized quantifier facilitate formulating interesting solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and secure equilibrium in a straightforward way. We also present a novel translation from ATL with strategy contexts to Quantified Computation Tree Logic (QCTL). Together with the translation which eliminates preference and the specialized form of quantification, this translation allows reasoning about infinite multiplayer synchronous games on CGMs to be translated from the proposed extension of ATL with strategy contexts into QCTL. The setting is related to that of ordered objectives in the works of Bouyer, Brenguier, Markey and Ummels, except that our focus is on the use of the temporal logic languages mentioned above, and we rely on translations into QCTL for the algorithmic solutions.</p></details> | 30 pages |

In this work, we lay the foundations for a general theory of temporal data by introducing categories of narratives. These are sheaves on posets of time intervals that encode snapshots of a temporal object along with the relationships between them. This theory satisfies five desiderata distilled from the burgeoning field of time-varying graphs: (D1) it defines both time-varying objects and their morphisms; (D2) it distinguishes between cumulative and persistent interpretations and provides principled methods for transitioning between them; (D3) it systematically lifts static notions to their temporal analogues; (D4) it is object agnostic; (D5) it integrates with theories of dynamical systems. To achieve this, we build upon existing categorical and sheaf-theoretic approaches to temporal graph theory, generalizing them to any category with limits and colimits. We also formalize tacit intuitions that, while present, often remain implicit in temporal graph theory. Beyond synthesizing and reformulating existing ideas in categorical language, we introduce sheaf-theoretic constructions and prove results that, to our knowledge, have not appeared in the temporal data literature - such as the adjunction between persistent and cumulative narratives. More importantly, we integrate these existing and novel elements into a consistent and coherent framework, setting the stage for a unified theory of time-varying data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Furth...</summary><p>Further discussion of related work</p></details> |
| **[Towards Reliable Time Series Forecasting under Future Uncertainty: Ambiguity and Novelty Rejection Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19656v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world time series forecasting, uncertainty and lack of reliable evaluation pose significant challenges. Notably, forecasting errors often arise from underfitting in-distribution data and failing to handle out-of-distribution inputs. To enhance model reliability, we introduce a dual rejection mechanism combining ambiguity and novelty rejection. Ambiguity rejection, using prediction error variance, allows the model to abstain under low confidence, assessed through historical error variance analysis without future ground truth. Novelty rejection, employing Variational Autoencoders and Mahalanobis distance, detects deviations from training data. This dual approach improves forecasting reliability in dynamic environments by reducing errors and adapting to data changes, advancing reliability in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |

By modifying the base Spikformer model to use IAND instead of residual addition, the model exclusively utilizes spike computation. The hardware employs a fully parallel tick-batching dataflow and a time-step reconfigurable neuron architecture, addressing the delay and power challenges of multi-timestep processing in spiking neural networks. This approach processes outputs from all time steps in parallel, reducing computation delay and eliminating membrane memory, thereby lowering energy consumption. The accelerator supports 3x3 and 1x1 convolutions and matrix operations through vectorized processing, meeting model requirements. Implemented in TSMC's 28nm process, it achieves 3.456 TSOPS (tera spike operations per second) with a power efficiency of 38.334 TSOPS/W at 500MHz, using 198.46K logic gates and 139.25KB of SRAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (IEEE ISCAS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Early Classification of Time Series: Taxonomy and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18332v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many situations, the measurements of a studied phenomenon are provided sequentially, and the prediction of its class needs to be made as early as possible so as not to incur too high a time penalty, but not too early and risk paying the cost of misclassification. This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm).</p></details> |  |

We show how optimizing for inference time performance can improve overall model efficacy. We consider generic inference time objectives with $k$ samples, with a focus on pass@$k$ and majority voting as two main applications. With language model training on reasoning datasets, we showcase the performance trade-off enabled by training with such objectives. When training on code generation tasks, we show that the approach significantly improves pass@$k$ objectives compared to the baseline method.</p></details> |  |

Modern production lines, specializing in robotics, require higher flexibility and mobility, which drives the integration of Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and 5G networks in Industry 4.0. TSN achieves deterministic communications by using mechanisms such as the IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), which schedules packet transmissions within precise cycles, thereby reducing latency, jitter, and congestion. 5G networks complement TSN by providing wireless mobility and supporting ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications. However, 5G channel effects such as fast fading, interference, and network-induced latency and jitter can disrupt TSN traffic, potentially compromising deterministic scheduling and performance. This paper presents an empirical analysis of 5G network latency and jitter on IEEE 802.1Qbv performance in a 5G-TSN network. We evaluate the impact of 5G integration on TSN's deterministic scheduling through a testbed combining IEEE 802.1Qbv-enabled switches, TSN translators, and a commercial 5G system. Our results show that, with proper TAS configuration in the TSN switch aligned with the 5G system, jitter can be mitigated, maintaining deterministic performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>21st ...</summary><p>21st IEEE International Conference on Factory Communication Systems (WFCS 2025) (8 pages)</p></details> |

Our algorithm returns a $(1-\varepsilon)$-approximation to the matrix norm in time $\widetilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{q \varepsilon} \cdot \text{nnz}(\boldsymbol{\mathit{A}})\right)$, where $\boldsymbol{\mathit{A}}$ is the input matrix, and improves upon the previous state of the art, which either proved convergence only in the limit [Boyd '74], or had very high polynomial running times [Bhaskara-Vijayraghavan, SODA '11]. Our algorithm is extremely simple, and is largely inspired from the coordinate-scaling approach used for positive linear program solvers. We note that our algorithm can readily be used in the [Englert-R\"{a}cke, FOCS '09] to improve the running time of constructing $O(\log n)$-competitive $\ell_p$-oblivious routings. We thus complement this result with a simple cutting-plane based scheme for computing $\textit{optimal}$ oblivious routings in graphs with respect to any monotone norm. Combined with state of the art cutting-plane solvers, this scheme runs in time $\widetilde{O}(n^6 m^3)$, which is significantly faster than the one based on Englert-R\"{a}cke, and generalizes the $\ell_\infty$ routing algorithm of [Azar-Cohen-Fiat-Kaplan-R\"acke, STOC '03].</p></details> |  |

Although combination, in a broad sense, is widely used in meteorological forecasting, systematic studies of combination methodology in meteorology are scarce. In this article, we study several combination methods, both state-of-the-art and of our own making, with a particular emphasis on situations where one seeks to predict when a particular event of interest will occur. Such time-to-event forecasts require particular methodology and care. We conduct a careful comparison of the different combination methods through an extensive simulation study, where we investigate the conditions under which the combined forecast will outperform the individual forecasting products. Further, we investigate the performance of the methods in a case-study modelling the time to first hard freeze in Norway and parts of Fennoscandia.</p></details> |  |

Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in a metric space and $r_x$ be the distance between $x \in P$ and its $\lceil n/k \rceil$-th nearest neighbor. The problem asks to optimize the $k$-center objective under the constraint that, for every point $x$, there is a center within distance $r_x$. We give bicriteria $(\beta,\gamma)$-approximation algorithms that compute clusterings such that every point $x \in P$ has a center within distance $\beta r_x$ and the clustering cost is at most $\gamma$ times the optimal cost. Our main contributions are a deterministic $O(n^2+ kn \log n)$ time $(2,2)$-approximation algorithm and a randomized $O(nk\log(n/\delta)+k^2/\varepsilon)$ time $(10,2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm, where $\delta$ denotes the failure probability. For the latter, we develop a randomized sampling procedure to compute constant factor approximations for the values $r_x$ for all $x\in P$ in subquadratic time; we believe this procedure to be of independent interest within the context of individual fairness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Imperceptible Adversarial Attacks for Time Series Classification with Local Perturbations and Frequency Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19519v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial attacks in time series classification (TSC) models have recently gained attention due to their potential to compromise model robustness. Imperceptibility is crucial, as adversarial examples detected by the human vision system (HVS) can render attacks ineffective. Many existing methods fail to produce high-quality imperceptible examples, often generating perturbations with more perceptible low-frequency components, like square waves, and global perturbations that reduce stealthiness. This paper aims to improve the imperceptibility of adversarial attacks on TSC models by addressing frequency components and time series locality. We propose the Shapelet-based Frequency-domain Attack (SFAttack), which uses local perturbations focused on time series shapelets to enhance discriminative information and stealthiness. Additionally, we introduce a low-frequency constraint to confine perturbations to high-frequency components, enhancing imperceptibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[A multiobjective approach to robust predictive control barrier functions for discrete-time systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19485v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimisation-based approach to ensure robust asymptotic stability stability of a desired set in the state space of nonlinear dynamical systems, while optimising a general control objective. The approach relies on the decrease of a robust predictive control barrier function (PCBF), which is defined as the optimal value function of a slack minimisation problem with respect to the target set. We show continuity of the proposed robust PCBF, allowing the introduction of a decrease constraint in the control objective minimisation. The PCBF decrease is given with respect to a warmstart value based on a feasible solution at the prior time step. Thereby, the control objective can be optimised while ensuring robust asymptotic stability of the target set. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed formulation on a linear space rendezvous and nonlinear lane changing problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Time-of-Flight Depth Denoising with Confidence-Aware Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19448v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors efficiently capture scene depth, but the nonlinear depth construction procedure often results in extremely large noise variance or even invalid areas. Recent methods based on deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve enhanced ToF denoising accuracy but tend to struggle when presented with severe noise corruption due to limited prior knowledge of ToF data distribution. In this paper, we propose DepthCAD, a novel ToF denoising approach that ensures global structural smoothness by leveraging the rich prior knowledge in Stable Diffusion and maintains local metric accuracy by steering the diffusion process with confidence guidance. To adopt the pretrained image diffusion model to ToF depth denoising, we apply the diffusion on raw ToF correlation measurements with dynamic range normalization before converting to depth maps. Experimental results validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed scheme, and the evaluation on real data further verifies its robustness against real-world ToF noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Closer Look at Time Steps is Worthy of Triple Speed-Up for Diffusion Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17403v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training diffusion models is always a computation-intensive task. In this paper, we introduce a novel speed-up method for diffusion model training, called, which is based on a closer look at time steps. Our key findings are: i) Time steps can be empirically divided into acceleration, deceleration, and convergence areas based on the process increment. ii) These time steps are imbalanced, with many concentrated in the convergence area. iii) The concentrated steps provide limited benefits for diffusion training. To address this, we design an asymmetric sampling strategy that reduces the frequency of steps from the convergence area while increasing the sampling probability for steps from other areas. Additionally, we propose a weighting strategy to emphasize the importance of time steps with rapid-change process increments. As a plug-and-play and architecture-agnostic approach, SpeeD consistently achieves 3-times acceleration across various diffusion architectures, datasets, and tasks. Notably, due to its simple design, our approach significantly reduces the cost of diffusion model training with minimal overhead. Our research enables more researchers to train diffusion models at a lower cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anvil: A General-Purpose Timing-Safe Hardware Description Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19447v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hardware designs routinely use stateless signals which change with their underlying registers. Unintended behaviours arise when a register is mutated even when its dependent signals are expected to remain stable (unchanged). Such timing hazards are common because, with a few exceptions, existing HDLs lack the abstraction for stable values and delegate this responsibility to hardware designers, who then have to carefully decide whether a value remains unchanged, sometimes even across hardware modules. This paper proposes Anvil, an HDL which statically prevents timing hazards with a novel type system. Anvil is the only HDL we know of that guarantees timing safety without sacrificing expressiveness for cycle-level timing control or dynamic timing behaviours. Instead of abstracting away differences between registers and signals, Anvil's type system exposes them fully but captures timing relationships between register mutations and signal usages for enforcing timing safety. This, in turn, enables safe composition of communicating hardware modules by static enforcement of timing contracts that encode timing constraints on shared signals. Such timing contracts can be specified parametric on abstract time points that can vary during run-time, allowing the type system to statically express dynamic timing behaviour. We have implemented Anvil and successfully used it for implementing key timing-sensitive modules in an open-source RISC-V CPU, which demonstrates its expressiveness and practicality.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Inference-Time Scaling for Flow Models via Stochastic Generation and Rollover Budget Forcing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19385v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an inference-time scaling approach for pretrained flow models. Recently, inference-time scaling has gained significant attention in LLMs and diffusion models, improving sample quality or better aligning outputs with user preferences by leveraging additional computation. For diffusion models, particle sampling has allowed more efficient scaling due to the stochasticity at intermediate denoising steps. On the contrary, while flow models have gained popularity as an alternative to diffusion models--offering faster generation and high-quality outputs in state-of-the-art image and video generative models--efficient inference-time scaling methods used for diffusion models cannot be directly applied due to their deterministic generative process. To enable efficient inference-time scaling for flow models, we propose three key ideas: 1) SDE-based generation, enabling particle sampling in flow models, 2) Interpolant conversion, broadening the search space and enhancing sample diversity, and 3) Rollover Budget Forcing (RBF), an adaptive allocation of computational resources across timesteps to maximize budget utilization. Our experiments show that SDE-based generation, particularly variance-preserving (VP) interpolant-based generation, improves the performance of particle sampling methods for inference-time scaling in flow models. Additionally, we demonstrate that RBF with VP-SDE achieves the best performance, outperforming all previous inference-time scaling approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://flow-inference-time-scaling.github.io/</p></details> |

In this work, we enhance video diffusion models by allowing motion control via structured latent noise sampling. This is achieved by just a change in data: we pre-process training videos to yield structured noise. Consequently, our method is agnostic to diffusion model design, requiring no changes to model architectures or training pipelines. Specifically, we propose a novel noise warping algorithm, fast enough to run in real time, that replaces random temporal Gaussianity with correlated warped noise derived from optical flow fields, while preserving the spatial Gaussianity. The efficiency of our algorithm enables us to fine-tune modern video diffusion base models using warped noise with minimal overhead, and provide a one-stop solution for a wide range of user-friendly motion control: local object motion control, global camera movement control, and motion transfer. The harmonization between temporal coherence and spatial Gaussianity in our warped noise leads to effective motion control while maintaining per-frame pixel quality. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate the advantages of our method, making it a robust and scalable approach for controlling motion in video diffusion models.

We investigate the effectiveness of test-time training (TTT) -- temporarily updating model parameters during inference using a loss derived from input data -- as a mechanism for improving LMs' reasoning and few-shot learning capabilities. On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), performing TTT with in-context examples yields up to $6\times$ higher accuracy compared to fine-tuned baselines -- reaching $53.0\%$ on the public validation set with an 8B-parameter LM and $61.9\%$ when ensembled with program-synthesis methods, matching average human performance. On BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), TTT on in-context examples surpasses standard few-shot prompting in the $10$-shot setting by $7.3$ percentage points ($50.5\%$ to $57.8\%$). Our findings highlight the limitations of in-context learning for novel tasks and demonstrate the potential of test-time training to enhance language model adaptability.</p></details> | Preprint |

The recent development of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) offers a promising approach for real-time dense 3D reconstruction. However, existing 3DGS-based SLAM systems struggle to balance hardware simplicity, speed, and map quality. Most systems excel in one or two of the aforementioned aspects but rarely achieve all. A key issue is the difficulty of initializing 3D Gaussians while concurrently conducting SLAM. To address these challenges, we present Monocular GSO (MGSO), a novel real-time SLAM system that integrates photometric SLAM with 3DGS. Photometric SLAM provides dense structured point clouds for 3DGS initialization, accelerating optimization and producing more efficient maps with fewer Gaussians. As a result, experiments show that our system generates reconstructions with a balance of quality, memory efficiency, and speed that outperforms the state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our system achieves all results using RGB inputs. We evaluate the Replica, TUM-RGBD, and EuRoC datasets against current live dense reconstruction systems. Not only do we surpass contemporary systems, but experiments also show that we maintain our performance on laptop hardware, making it a practical solution for robotics, A/R, and other real-time applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version of this work has been approved by the IEEE for publication.

Hybrid MRI-linear accelerator (MRI-linac) systems allow real-time motion management during irradiation. This paper presents a multi-institutional real-time MRI time series dataset from different MRI-linac vendors. The dataset is designed to support developing and evaluating real-time tumor localization (tracking) algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy within the TrackRAD2025 challenge (https://trackrad2025.grand-challenge.org/). Acquisition and validation methods: The dataset consists of sagittal 2D cine MRIs in 585 patients from six centers (3 Dutch, 1 German, 1 Australian, and 1 Chinese). Tumors in the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis acquired on two commercially available MRI-linacs (0.35 T and 1.5 T) were included. For 108 cases, irradiation targets or tracking surrogates were manually segmented on each temporal frame. The dataset was randomly split into a public training set of 527 cases (477 unlabeled and 50 labeled) and a private testing set of 58 cases (all labeled). Data Format and Usage Notes: The data is publicly available under the TrackRAD2025 collection: https://doi.org/10.57967/hf/4539. Both the images and segmentations for each patient are available in metadata format. Potential Applications: This novel clinical dataset will enable the development and evaluation of real-time tumor localization algorithms for MRI-guided radiotherapy.

Recently, researchers in Large Language Models (LLMs) have expanded the scaling to test-time, which can significantly improve LLM performance by using more inference-time computation. Instead of scaling up video foundation models through expensive training costs, we explore the power of Test-Time Scaling (TTS) in video generation, aiming to answer the question: if a video generation model is allowed to use non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve generation quality given a challenging text prompt. In this work, we reinterpret the test-time scaling of video generation as a searching problem to sample better trajectories from Gaussian noise space to the target video distribution. Specifically, we build the search space with test-time verifiers to provide feedback and heuristic algorithms to guide searching process. Given a text prompt, we first explore an intuitive linear search strategy by increasing noise candidates at inference time. As full-step denoising all frames simultaneously requires heavy test-time computation costs, we further design a more efficient TTS method for video generation called Tree-of-Frames (ToF) that adaptively expands and prunes video branches in an autoregressive manner. Extensive experiments on text-conditioned video generation benchmarks demonstrate that increasing test-time compute consistently leads to significant improvements in the quality of videos.

However, these models still face challenges scaling storage efficiently. Inspired by psychological theories of continuous neural resource allocation in working memory, we propose an approach that compresses large discrete Hopfield memories into smaller, continuous-time memories. Leveraging continuous attention, our new energy function modifies the update rule of HNs, replacing the traditional softmax-based probability mass function with a probability density, over the continuous memory. This formulation aligns with modern perspectives on human executive function, offering a principled link between attractor dynamics in working memory and resource-efficient memory allocation. Our framework maintains competitive performance with HNs while leveraging a compressed memory, reducing computational costs across synthetic and video datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropic Analysis of Time Series through Kernel Density Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18916v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a novel framework for time series analysis using entropic measures based on the kernel density estimate (KDE) of the time series' Takens' embeddings. Using this framework we introduce two distinct analytical tools: (1) a multi-scale KDE entropy metric, denoted as $\Delta\text{KE}$, which quantifies the evolution of time series complexity across different scales by measuring certain entropy changes, and (2) a sliding baseline method that employs the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to detect changes in time series dynamics through changes in KDEs. The $\Delta{\rm KE}$ metric offers insights into the information content and ``unfolding'' properties of the time series' embedding related to dynamical systems, while the KL divergence-based approach provides a noise and outlier robust approach for identifying time series change points (injections in RF signals, e.g.). We demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of these tools through a set of experiments encompassing diverse domains. In the space of radio frequency (RF) signal processing, we achieve accurate detection of signal injections under varying noise and interference conditions. Furthermore, we apply our methodology to electrocardiography (ECG) data, successfully identifying instances of ventricular fibrillation with high accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of our tools for dynamic state detection by accurately identifying chaotic regimes within an intermittent signal. These results show the broad applicability of our framework for extracting meaningful insights from complex time series data across various scientific disciplines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zak-OTFS for Identification of Linear Time-Varying Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18900v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear time-varying (LTV) systems model radar scenes where each reflector/target applies a delay, Doppler shift and complex amplitude scaling to a transmitted waveform. The receiver processes the received signal using the transmitted signal as a reference. The self-ambiguity function of the transmitted signal captures the cross-correlation of delay and Doppler shifts of the transmitted waveform. It acts as a blur that limits resolution, at the receiver, of the delay and Doppler shifts of targets in close proximity. This paper considers resolution of multiple targets and compares performance of traditional chirp waveforms with the Zak-OTFS waveform. The self-ambiguity function of a chirp is a line in the delay-Doppler domain, whereas the self-ambiguity function of the Zak-OTFS waveform is a lattice. The advantage of lattices over lines is better localization, and we show lattices provide superior noise-free estimation of the range and velocity of multiple targets. When the delay spread of the radar scene is less than the delay period of the Zak-OTFS modulation, and the Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, we describe how to localize targets by calculating cross-ambiguities in the delay-Doppler domain. We show that the signal processing complexity of our approach is superior to the traditional approach of computing cross-ambiguities in the continuous time / frequency domain.</p></details> |  |

Deciding the outcome (i.e. which player has a winning strategy) is PSPACE-complete even when restricted to 5-uniform hypergraphs (Koepke, 2025). On hypergraphs of rank 3, a structural characterization of the outcome and a polynomial-time algorithm have been obtained for two subcases: one by Kutz (2005), the other by Rahman and Watson (2020) who conjectured that their result should generalize to all hypergraphs of rank 3. We prove this conjecture through a structural characterization of the outcome and a description of both players' optimal strategies, all based on intersections of some key subhypergraph collections, from which we derive a polynomial-time algorithm. Another corollary of our structural result is that, if Maker has a winning strategy on a hypergraph of rank 3, then she can ensure to win the game in a number of rounds that is logarithmic in the number of vertices.

While current one-stage methods, which follow a DETR-style pipeline, achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with high-resolution inputs, we observe that this particularly benefits the estimation of individuals in smaller scales of the image (e.g., those far from the camera), but at the cost of significantly increased computation overhead. To address this, we introduce scale-adaptive tokens that are dynamically adjusted based on the relative scale of each individual in the image within the DETR framework. Specifically, individuals in smaller scales are processed at higher resolutions, larger ones at lower resolutions, and background regions are further distilled. These scale-adaptive tokens more efficiently encode the image features, facilitating subsequent decoding to regress the human mesh, while allowing the model to allocate computational resources more effectively and focus on more challenging cases. Experiments show that our method preserves the accuracy benefits of high-resolution processing while substantially reducing computational cost, achieving real-time inference with performance comparable to SOTA methods.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

When considering a given routing, the unicast message starts at its source and goes over several dedicated resources to reach its destination. Such unicast message can be represented as a chain of point-to-point communications. Thus, the scheduling of the periodic chains is a principal problem in time-triggered Ethernet, like IEEE 802.1Qbv Time-Sensitive Networks. This paper studies a strongly NP-hard periodic scheduling problem with harmonic periods, task chains, and dedicated resources. We analyze the problem on several levels of generality and complexity and provide the corresponding proofs. We describe a solution methodology to find a feasible schedule that minimizes the chains' degeneracy related to start-to-end latency normalized in the number of periods. We use the local search with the first fit scheduling heuristic, which we warm-start with a constraint programming model. This notably improves the schedulability of instances with up to 100% utilization and thousands (and more) of tasks, with high-quality solutions found in minutes. An efficient constraint programming matheuristic significantly reduces the degeneracy of the found schedules even further. The method is evaluated on sets of industrial-, avionic-, and automotive-inspired instances.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, preprint to Computers & Operations Research</p></details> |
| **[Entropy annealing for policy mirror descent in continuous time and space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20250v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy regularization has been widely used in policy optimization algorithms to enhance exploration and the robustness of the optimal control; however it also introduces an additional regularization bias. This work quantifies the impact of entropy regularization on the convergence of policy gradient methods for stochastic exit time control problems. We analyze a continuous-time policy mirror descent dynamics, which updates the policy based on the gradient of an entropy-regularized value function and adjusts the strength of entropy regularization as the algorithm progresses. We prove that with a fixed entropy level, the mirror descent dynamics converges exponentially to the optimal solution of the regularized problem. We further show that when the entropy level decays at suitable polynomial rates, the annealed flow converges to the solution of the unregularized problem at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/S)$ for discrete action spaces and, under suitable conditions, at a rate of $\mathcal O(1/\sqrt{S})$ for general action spaces, with $S$ being the gradient flow running time. The technical challenge lies in analyzing the gradient flow in the infinite-dimensional space of Markov kernels for nonconvex objectives. This paper explains how entropy regularization improves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective of convergence rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Video Diffusion Models for Time-Lapse Microscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18583v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a domain adaptation of video diffusion models to generate highly realistic time-lapse microscopy videos of cell division in HeLa cells. Although state-of-the-art generative video models have advanced significantly for natural videos, they remain underexplored in microscopy domains. To address this gap, we fine-tune a pretrained video diffusion model on microscopy-specific sequences, exploring three conditioning strategies: (1) text prompts derived from numeric phenotypic measurements (e.g., proliferation rates, migration speeds, cell-death frequencies), (2) direct numeric embeddings of phenotype scores, and (3) image-conditioned generation, where an initial microscopy frame is extended into a complete video sequence. Evaluation using biologically meaningful morphological, proliferation, and migration metrics demonstrates that fine-tuning substantially improves realism and accurately captures critical cellular behaviors such as mitosis and migration. Notably, the fine-tuned model also generalizes beyond the training horizon, generating coherent cell dynamics even in extended sequences. However, precisely controlling specific phenotypic characteristics remains challenging, highlighting opportunities for future work to enhance conditioning methods. Our results demonstrate the potential for domain-specific fine-tuning of generative video models to produce biologically plausible synthetic microscopy data, supporting applications such as in-silico hypothesis testing and data augmentation.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the complexity of the domain shift problem, the performance of existing models will degrade, especially when it comes to multi-domain or cross-domain tasks. In this paper, we propose a Test-time style transfer (T3s) that uses a bidirectional mapping mechanism to project the features of the source and target domains into a unified feature space, enhancing the generalization ability of the model. To further increase the style expression space, we introduce a Cross-domain style diversification module (CSDM) to ensure the orthogonality between style bases. In addition, data augmentation and low-rank adaptation techniques are used to improve feature alignment and sensitivity, enabling the model to adapt to multi-domain inputs effectively. Our method has demonstrated effectiveness on three unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Neighborhood Local Search for Single-Machine Scheduling with Family Setup Times](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00771v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study the task of scheduling jobs on a single machine with sequence dependent family setup times under the goal of minimizing the makespan, that is, the completion time of the last job in the schedule. This notoriously NP-hard problem is highly relevant in practical productions and requires heuristics that provide good solutions quickly in order to deal with large instances. In this paper, we present a heuristic based on the approach of parameterized local search. That is, we aim to replace a given solution by a better solution having distance at most $k$ in a pre-defined distance measure. This is done multiple times in a hill-climbing manner, until a locally optimal solution is reached. We analyze the trade-off between the allowed distance $k$ and the algorithm's running time for four natural distance measures. Example of allowed operations for our considered distance measures are: swapping $k$ pairs of jobs in the sequence, or rearranging $k$ consecutive jobs. For two distance measures, we show that finding an improvement for given $k$ can be done in $f(k) \cdot n^{\mathcal{O}(1)}$ time, while such a running time for the other two distance measures is unlikely. We provide a preliminary experimental evaluation of our local search approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teller: Real-Time Streaming Audio-Driven Portrait Animation with Autoregressive Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18429v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce the first autoregressive framework for real-time, audio-driven portrait animation, a.k.a, talking head. Beyond the challenge of lengthy animation times, a critical challenge in realistic talking head generation lies in preserving the natural movement of diverse body parts. To this end, we propose Teller, the first streaming audio-driven protrait animation framework with autoregressive motion generation. Specifically, Teller first decomposes facial and body detail animation into two components: Facial Motion Latent Generation (FMLG) based on an autoregressive transfromer, and movement authenticity refinement using a Efficient Temporal Module (ETM).Concretely, FMLG employs a Residual VQ model to map the facial motion latent from the implicit keypoint-based model into discrete motion tokens, which are then temporally sliced with audio embeddings. This enables the AR tranformer to learn real-time, stream-based mappings from audio to motion. Furthermore, Teller incorporate ETM to capture finer motion details. This module ensures the physical consistency of body parts and accessories, such as neck muscles and earrings, improving the realism of these movements. Teller is designed to be efficient, surpassing the inference speed of diffusion-based models (Hallo 20.93s vs. Teller 0.92s for one second video generation), and achieves a real-time streaming performance of up to 25 FPS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms recent audio-driven portrait animation models, especially in small movements, as validated by human evaluations with a significant margin in quality and realism.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept in CVPR 2025 Conference Submission</p></details> |

This improves the previous $\tilde O(n^{3/2})$ preprocessing time [JACM'23]. Our main technical contribution is a near optimal construction of \emph{additively weighted Voronoi diagrams} in undirected planar graphs. Namely, given a planar graph $G$ and a face $f$, we show that one can preprocess $G$ in $\tilde O(n)$ time such that given any weight assignment to the vertices of $f$ one can construct the additively weighted Voronoi diagram of $f$ in near optimal $\tilde O(|f|)$ time. This improves the $\tilde O(\sqrt{n |f|})$ construction time of [JACM'23].</p></details> |  |

Prior finite time analysis of such algorithms has focused on fixed point iterations with mappings contractive under Euclidean norm. Motivated by applications in reinforcement learning, we give the first mean square bound on non linear two-time-scale SA where the iterations have arbitrary norm contractive mappings and Markovian noise. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$ in the general case, and at a rate of $O(1/n)$ in a special case where the slower timescale is noiseless. Our analysis uses the generalized Moreau envelope to handle the arbitrary norm contractions and solutions of Poisson equation to deal with the Markovian noise. By analyzing the SSP Q-Learning algorithm, we give the first $O(1/n)$ bound for an algorithm for asynchronous control of MDPs under the average reward criterion. We also obtain a rate of $O(1/n)$ for Q-Learning with Polyak-averaging and provide an algorithm for learning Generalized Nash Equilibrium (GNE) for strongly monotone games which converges at a rate of $O(1/n^{2/3})$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[RoCA: Robust Contrastive One-class Time Series Anomaly Detection with Contaminated Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18385v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The accumulation of time-series signals and the absence of labels make time-series Anomaly Detection (AD) a self-supervised task of deep learning. Methods based on normality assumptions face the following three limitations: (1) A single assumption could hardly characterize the whole normality or lead to some deviation. (2) Some assumptions may go against the principle of AD. (3) Their basic assumption is that the training data is uncontaminated (free of anomalies), which is unrealistic in practice, leading to a decline in robustness. This paper proposes a novel robust approach, RoCA, which is the first to address all of the above three challenges, as far as we are aware. It fuses the separated assumptions of one-class classification and contrastive learning in a single training process to characterize a more complete so-called normality. Additionally, it monitors the training data and computes a carefully designed anomaly score throughout the training process. This score helps identify latent anomalies, which are then used to define the classification boundary, inspired by the concept of outlier exposure. The performance on AIOps datasets improved by 6% compared to when contamination was not considered (COCA). On two large and high-dimensional multivariate datasets, the performance increased by 5% to 10%. RoCA achieves the highest average performance on both univariate and multivariate datasets.

| **[Efficient Inference in First Passage Time Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18381v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>First passage time models describe the time it takes for a random process to exit a region of interest and are widely used across various scientific fields. Fast and accurate numerical methods for computing the likelihood function in these models are essential for efficient statistical inference. Specifically, in mathematical psychology, generalized drift diffusion models (GDDMs) are an important class of first passage time models that describe the latent psychological processes underlying simple decision-making scenarios. GDDMs model the joint distribution over choices and response times as the first hitting time of a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) to possibly time-varying upper and lower boundaries. They are widely applied to extract parameters associated with distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms. However, current likelihood computation methods struggle with common scenarios where drift rates covary dynamically with exogenous covariates in each trial, such as in the attentional drift diffusion model (aDDM). In this work, we propose a fast and flexible algorithm for computing the likelihood function of GDDMs based on a large class of SDEs satisfying the Cherkasov condition. Our method divides each trial into discrete stages, employs fast analytical results to compute stage-wise densities, and integrates these to compute the overall trial-wise likelihood. Numerical examples demonstrate that our method not only yields accurate likelihood evaluations for efficient statistical inference, but also significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Cache Noise in Test-Time Adaptation for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18334v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) of visual language models has recently attracted significant attention as a solution to the performance degradation caused by distribution shifts in downstream tasks. However, existing cache-based TTA methods have certain limitations. They mainly rely on the accuracy of cached feature labels, and the presence of noisy pseudo-labels can cause these features to deviate from their true distribution. This makes cache retrieval methods based on similarity matching highly sensitive to outliers or extreme samples. Moreover, current methods lack effective mechanisms to model class distributions, which limits their ability to fully exploit the potential of cached information. To address these challenges, we introduce a comprehensive and reliable caching mechanism and propose a novel zero-shot TTA method called ``Cache, Residual, Gaussian" (CRG). This method not only employs learnable residual parameters to better align positive and negative visual prototypes with text prototypes, thereby optimizing the quality of cached features, but also incorporates Gaussian Discriminant Analysis (GDA) to dynamically model intra-class feature distributions, further mitigating the impact of noisy features. Experimental results on 13 benchmarks demonstrate that CRG outperforms state-of-the-art TTA methods, showcasing exceptional robustness and adaptability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICME 2025 and ICLR 2025 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |
| **[Embedding Network Autoregression for time series analysis and causal peer effect inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05944v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an Embedding Network Autoregressive Model for multivariate networked longitudinal data. We assume the network is generated from a latent variable model, and these unobserved variables are included in a structural peer effect model or a time series network autoregressive model as additive effects. This approach takes a unified view of two related yet fundamentally different problems: (1) modeling and predicting multivariate networked time series data and (2) causal peer influence estimation in the presence of homophily from finite time longitudinal data. Our estimation strategy comprises estimating latent variables from the observed network followed by least squares estimation of the network autoregressive model. We show that the estimated momentum and peer effect parameters are consistent and asymptotically normally distributed in setups with a growing number of network vertices (N) while considering both a growing number of time points T (for the time series problem) and finite T cases (for the peer effect problem). We allow the number of latent vectors K to grow at appropriate rates, which improves upon existing rates when such results are available for related models. Our theoretical results encompass cases both when the network is modeled with the random dot product graph model (ENAR) and a more general latent space model with both additive and multiplicative effects (AMNAR). We also develop a selection criterion when K is unknown that provably does not under-select and show that the theoretical guarantees hold with the selected number for K as well. Interestingly, even though we propose a unified model, our theoretical results find that different growth rates and restrictions on the latent vectors are needed to induce omitted variable bias in the peer effect problem and to ensure consistent estimation in the time series problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopV: Compatible Token Pruning with Inference Time Optimization for Fast and Low-Memory Multimodal Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18278v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demand substantial computational resources during inference, largely due to the extensive visual input tokens for representing visual information. Previous studies have noted that visual tokens tend to receive less attention than text tokens, suggesting their lower importance during inference and potential for pruning. However, their methods encounter several challenges: reliance on greedy heuristic criteria for token importance and incompatibility with FlashAttention and KV cache. To address these issues, we introduce \textbf{TopV}, a compatible \textbf{TO}ken \textbf{P}runing with inference Time Optimization for fast and low-memory \textbf{V}LM, achieving efficient pruning without additional training or fine-tuning. Instead of relying on attention scores, we formulate token pruning as an optimization problem, accurately identifying important visual tokens while remaining compatible with FlashAttention. Additionally, since we only perform this pruning once during the prefilling stage, it effectively reduces KV cache size. Our optimization framework incorporates a visual-aware cost function considering factors such as Feature Similarity, Relative Spatial Distance, and Absolute Central Distance, to measure the importance of each source visual token, enabling effective pruning of low-importance tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous token pruning methods, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Atom of Thoughts for Markov LLM Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12018v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve superior performance through training-time scaling, and test-time scaling further enhances their capabilities by conducting effective reasoning during inference. However, as the scale of reasoning increases, existing test-time scaling methods suffer from accumulated historical information, which not only wastes computational resources but also interferes with effective reasoning. To address this issue, we observe that complex reasoning can be achieved by solving a series of independent and self-contained subquestions. These subquestions are essentially \textit{atomic questions}, exhibiting the memoryless property similar to Markov processes. Based on this observation, we propose Atom of Thoughts (\our), where each state transition consists of decomposing the current question into a dependency-based directed acyclic graph and contracting its subquestions, forming a simplified question that maintains answer equivalence with the original problem. This answer preservation enables the iterative \textit{decomposition-contraction} process to naturally form a meaningful Markov reasoning process. Furthermore, these atomic states can be seamlessly integrated into existing test-time scaling methods, enabling \our to serve as a plug-in enhancement for improving reasoning capabilities. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of \our both as a standalone framework and a plug-in enhancement. Notably, on HotpotQA, when applied to gpt-4o-mini, \our achieves an \textbf{80.6\%} F1 score, surpassing o3-mini by \textbf{3.4\%} and DeepSeek-R1 by \textbf{10.6\%}.

SANA-Sprint is built on a pre-trained foundation model and augmented with hybrid distillation, dramatically reducing inference steps from 20 to 1-4. We introduce three key innovations: (1) We propose a training-free approach that transforms a pre-trained flow-matching model for continuous-time consistency distillation (sCM), eliminating costly training from scratch and achieving high training efficiency. Our hybrid distillation strategy combines sCM with latent adversarial distillation (LADD): sCM ensures alignment with the teacher model, while LADD enhances single-step generation fidelity. (2) SANA-Sprint is a unified step-adaptive model that achieves high-quality generation in 1-4 steps, eliminating step-specific training and improving efficiency. (3) We integrate ControlNet with SANA-Sprint for real-time interactive image generation, enabling instant visual feedback for user interaction. SANA-Sprint establishes a new Pareto frontier in speed-quality tradeoffs, achieving state-of-the-art performance with 7.59 FID and 0.74 GenEval in only 1 step - outperforming FLUX-schnell (7.94 FID / 0.71 GenEval) while being 10x faster (0.1s vs 1.1s on H100).

Existing methods often require extensive training or costly self-supervised optimization. In this paper, we present OmnimatteZero, a training-free approach that leverages off-the-shelf pre-trained video diffusion models for omnimatte. It can remove objects from videos, extract individual object layers along with their effects, and composite those objects onto new videos. We accomplish this by adapting zero-shot image inpainting techniques for video object removal, a task they fail to handle effectively out-of-the-box. We then show that self-attention maps capture information about the object and its footprints and use them to inpaint the object's effects, leaving a clean background. Additionally, through simple latent arithmetic, object layers can be isolated and recombined seamlessly with new video layers to produce new videos. Evaluations show that OmnimatteZero not only achieves superior performance in terms of background reconstruction but also sets a new record for the fastest Omnimatte approach, achieving real-time performance with minimal frame runtime.</p></details> |  |
| **[EAGLE-3: Scaling up Inference Acceleration of Large Language Models via Training-Time Test](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01840v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sequential nature of modern LLMs makes them expensive and slow, and speculative sampling has proven to be an effective solution to this problem. Methods like EAGLE perform autoregression at the feature level, reusing top-layer features from the target model to achieve better results than vanilla speculative sampling. A growing trend in the LLM community is scaling up training data to improve model intelligence without increasing inference costs. However, we observe that scaling up data provides limited improvements for EAGLE. We identify that this limitation arises from EAGLE's feature prediction constraints. In this paper, we introduce EAGLE-3, which abandons feature prediction in favor of direct token prediction and replaces reliance on top-layer features with multi-layer feature fusion via a technique named training-time test. These improvements significantly enhance performance and enable the draft model to fully benefit from scaling up training data. Our experiments include both chat models and reasoning models, evaluated on five tasks. The results show that EAGLE-3 achieves a speedup ratio up to 6.5x, with about 1.4x improvement over EAGLE-2. In the SGLang framework, EAGLE-3 achieves a 1.38x throughput improvement at a batch size of 64. The code is available at https://github.com/SafeAILab/EAGLE.</p></details> |  |

While existing defense methods either suffer from adaptive attacks or require computationally expensive auxiliary models, we present STShield, a lightweight framework for real-time jailbroken judgement. STShield introduces a novel single-token sentinel mechanism that appends a binary safety indicator to the model's response sequence, leveraging the LLM's own alignment capabilities for detection. Our framework combines supervised fine-tuning on normal prompts with adversarial training using embedding-space perturbations, achieving robust detection while preserving model utility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STShield successfully defends against various jailbreak attacks, while maintaining the model's performance on legitimate queries. Compared to existing approaches, STShield achieves superior defense performance with minimal computational overhead, making it a practical solution for real-world LLM deployment.</p></details> | 11 pages |

An Explorative Study of Time Awareness Learned from Static Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17899v1)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time becomes visible through illumination changes in what we see. Inspired by this, in this paper we explore the potential to learn time awareness from static images, trying to answer: what time tells us? To this end, we first introduce a Time-Oriented Collection (TOC) dataset, which contains 130,906 images with reliable timestamps. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a Time-Image Contrastive Learning (TICL) approach to jointly model timestamps and related visual representations through cross-modal contrastive learning. We found that the proposed TICL, 1) not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on the timestamp estimation task, over various benchmark metrics, 2) but also, interestingly, though only seeing static images, the time-aware embeddings learned from TICL show strong capability in several time-aware downstream tasks such as time-based image retrieval, video scene classification, and time-aware image editing. Our findings suggest that time-related visual cues can be learned from static images and are beneficial for various vision tasks, laying a foundation for future research on understanding time-related visual context.

Our approach enables real-time rendering of dynamic scenes with interactively editable materials and dynamic lighting of diverse multi-lights settings, capturing mutual multi-bounce light transport (indirect illumination) between 3D Gaussians and mesh. Additionally, we present a real-time renderer with an interactive user interface, validating our approach and demonstrating its practicality and high efficiency with over 40 fps in scenes including both 3D Gaussians and mesh. Furthermore, our work highlights the potential of 3D Gaussians in real-time applications with dynamic lighting, offering insights into performance and optimization.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Constraint Programming (CP) and Temporal Networks have reinvoked interest in evaluating the advantages and drawbacks of various proactive and reactive scheduling methods. First, we present a new, CP-based fully proactive method. Second, we show how a reactive approach can be constructed using an online rescheduling procedure. A third contribution is based on partial order schedules and uses Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (STNUs).

| **[Enhancing Retrieval Systems with Inference-Time Logical Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17860v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional retrieval methods rely on transforming user queries into vector representations and retrieving documents based on cosine similarity within an embedding space. While efficient and scalable, this approach often fails to handle complex queries involving logical constructs such as negations, conjunctions, and disjunctions. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time logical reasoning framework that explicitly incorporates logical reasoning into the retrieval process. Our method extracts logical reasoning structures from natural language queries and then composes the individual cosine similarity scores to formulate the final document scores. This approach enables the retrieval process to handle complex logical reasoning without compromising computational efficiency. Our results on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms traditional retrieval methods across different models and datasets, significantly improving retrieval performance for complex queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Approximability of Unsplittable Flow on a Path with Time Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17802v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the Time-Windows Unsplittable Flow on a Path problem (twUFP) we are given a resource whose available amount changes over a given time interval (modeled as the edge-capacities of a given path $G$) and a collection of tasks. Each task is characterized by a demand (of the considered resource), a profit, an integral processing time, and a time window. Our goal is to compute a maximum profit subset of tasks and schedule them non-preemptively within their respective time windows, such that the total demand of the tasks using each edge $e$ is at most the capacity of $e$. We prove that twUFP is $\mathsf{APX}$-hard which contrasts the setting of the problem without time windows, i.e., Unsplittable Flow on a Path (UFP), for which a PTAS was recently discovered [Grandoni, M\"omke, Wiese, STOC 2022]. Then, we present a quasi-polynomial-time $2+\varepsilon$ approximation for twUFP under resource augmentation. Our approximation ratio improves to $1+\varepsilon$ if all tasks' time windows are identical. Our $\mathsf{APX}$-hardness holds also for this special case and, hence, rules out such a PTAS (and even a QPTAS, unless $\mathsf{NP}\subseteq\mathrm{DTIME}(n^{\mathrm{poly}(\log n)})$) without resource augmentation.</p></details> |  |

| **[Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v5)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for infinite programs with effects and nondeterminism is challenging. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate at the level of models such as traces and automata. Reasoning happens at a very low-level, requiring complex nested (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., the guardedness checker). Further, reasoning at the level of models instead of program constructs creates a verification gap that loses the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics such as Hoare Logic. To address this verification gap, and the lack of compositional proof techniques for temporal specifications, we propose Ticl, a new structural temporal logic. Using ticl, we encode complex (co-)inductive proof techniques as structural lemmas and focus our reasoning on variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform compositional proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working at a high level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, concurrent shared memory, and distributed consensus, demonstrating a low proof-to-code ratio.</p></details> |  |

This work addresses the critical need to explicitly incorporate ensemble parameters into the learning process, as traditional methods often neglect these, limiting their ability to adapt to diverse simulation settings and provide meaningful insights into the data dynamics. HyperFLINT introduces a hypernetwork to account for simulation parameters, enabling it to generate accurate interpolations and flow fields for each timestep by dynamically adapting to varying conditions, thereby outperforming existing parameter-agnostic approaches. The architecture features modular neural blocks with convolutional and deconvolutional layers, supported by a hypernetwork that generates weights for the main network, allowing the model to better capture intricate simulation dynamics. A series of experiments demonstrates HyperFLINT's significantly improved performance in flow field estimation and temporal interpolation, as well as its potential in enabling parameter space exploration, offering valuable insights into complex scientific ensembles.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Qualitative Preference in Alternating-time Temporal Logic with Strategy Contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13436v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how to add and eliminate binary preference on plays in Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL) with strategy contexts on Concurrent Game Models (CGMs) by means of a translation which preserves satisfaction in models where preference-indiscernibility between plays is an equivalence relation of finite index. The elimination technique also works for a companion second-order path quantifier, which makes quantified path variables range over sets of plays that are closed under preference-indiscernibility. We argue that the preference operator and the specialized quantifier facilitate formulating interesting solution concepts such as Nash equilibrium and secure equilibrium in a straightforward way. We also present a novel translation from ATL with strategy contexts to Quantified Computation Tree Logic (QCTL). Together with the translation which eliminates preference and the specialized form of quantification, this translation allows reasoning about infinite multiplayer synchronous games on CGMs to be translated from the proposed extension of ATL with strategy contexts into QCTL. The setting is related to that of ordered objectives in the works of Bouyer, Brenguier, Markey and Ummels, except that our focus is on the use of the temporal logic languages mentioned above, and we rely on translations into QCTL for the algorithmic solutions.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[EventMamba: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Locality with State Space Models for Event-Based Video Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19721v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging its robust linear global modeling capability, Mamba has notably excelled in computer vision. Despite its success, existing Mamba-based vision models have overlooked the nuances of event-driven tasks, especially in video reconstruction. Event-based video reconstruction (EBVR) demands spatial translation invariance and close attention to local event relationships in the spatio-temporal domain. Unfortunately, conventional Mamba algorithms apply static window partitions and standard reshape scanning methods, leading to significant losses in local connectivity. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EventMamba--a specialized model designed for EBVR tasks. EventMamba innovates by incorporating random window offset (RWO) in the spatial domain, moving away from the restrictive fixed partitioning. Additionally, it features a new consistent traversal serialization approach in the spatio-temporal domain, which maintains the proximity of adjacent events both spatially and temporally. These enhancements enable EventMamba to retain Mamba's robust modeling capabilities while significantly preserving the spatio-temporal locality of event data. Comprehensive testing on multiple datasets shows that EventMamba markedly enhances video reconstruction, drastically improving computation speed while delivering superior visual quality compared to Transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Time: A New Temporal Benchmark for VideoLLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07752v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated impressive performance when integrated with vision models even enabling video understanding. However, evaluating video models presents its own unique challenges, for which several benchmarks have been proposed. In this paper, we show that the currently most used video-language benchmarks can be solved without requiring much temporal reasoning. We identified three main issues in existing datasets: (i) static information from single frames is often sufficient to solve the tasks (ii) the text of the questions and candidate answers is overly informative, allowing models to answer correctly without relying on any visual input (iii) world knowledge alone can answer many of the questions, making the benchmarks a test of knowledge replication rather than video reasoning. In addition, we found that open-ended question-answering benchmarks for video understanding suffer from similar issues while the automatic evaluation process with LLMs is unreliable, making it an unsuitable alternative. As a solution, we propose TVBench, a novel open-source video multiple-choice question-answering benchmark, and demonstrate through extensive evaluations that it requires a high level of temporal understanding. Surprisingly, we find that most recent state-of-the-art video-language models perform similarly to random performance on TVBench, with only a few models such as Qwen2-VL, and Tarsier clearly surpassing this baseline.</p></details> |  |

However, they mainly focus on holistic comprehension and struggle with capturing fine-grained spatial and temporal details. Besides, the lack of high-quality object-level video instruction data and a comprehensive benchmark further hinders their advancements. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the VideoRefer Suite to empower Video LLM for finer-level spatial-temporal video understanding, i.e., enabling perception and reasoning on any objects throughout the video. Specially, we thoroughly develop VideoRefer Suite across three essential aspects: dataset, model, and benchmark. Firstly, we introduce a multi-agent data engine to meticulously curate a large-scale, high-quality object-level video instruction dataset, termed VideoRefer-700K. Next, we present the VideoRefer model, which equips a versatile spatial-temporal object encoder to capture precise regional and sequential representations. Finally, we meticulously create a VideoRefer-Bench to comprehensively assess the spatial-temporal understanding capability of a Video LLM, evaluating it across various aspects. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate that our VideoRefer model not only achieves promising performance on video referring benchmarks but also facilitates general video understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures, technical report</p></details> |

Interestingly, we find that adding position encoding, contrary to common observations, does not improve--and even degrades--performance. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when combined with pre-trained optical flow networks, which can limit the model's flexibility. To address these issues, we propose BF-STVSR, a C-STVSR framework with two key modules tailored to better represent spatial and temporal characteristics of video: 1) B-spline Mapper for smooth temporal interpolation, and 2) Fourier Mapper for capturing dominant spatial frequencies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art in various metrics, including PSNR and SSIM, showing enhanced spatial details and natural temporal consistency.

| **[BioMamba: Leveraging Spectro-Temporal Embedding in Bidirectional Mamba for Enhanced Biosignal Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11741v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biological signals, such as electroencephalograms (EEGs) and electrocardiograms (ECGs), play a pivotal role in numerous clinical practices, such as diagnosing brain and cardiac arrhythmic diseases. Existing methods for biosignal classification rely on Attention-based frameworks with dense Feed Forward layers, which lead to inefficient learning, high computational overhead, and suboptimal performance. In this work, we introduce BioMamba, a Spectro-Temporal Embedding strategy applied to the Bidirectional Mamba framework with Sparse Feed Forward layers to enable effective learning of biosignal sequences. By integrating these three key components, BioMamba effectively addresses the limitations of existing methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BioMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with marked improvement in classification performance. The advantages of the proposed BioMamba include (1) Reliability: BioMamba consistently delivers robust results, confirmed across six evaluation metrics. (2) Efficiency: We assess both model and training efficiency, the BioMamba demonstrates computational effectiveness by reducing model size and resource consumption compared to existing approaches. (3) Generality: With the capacity to effectively classify a diverse set of tasks, BioMamba demonstrates adaptability and effectiveness across various domains and applications.</p></details> | Biological signals |
| **[EfficientMT: Efficient Temporal Adaptation for Motion Transfer in Text-to-Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19369v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The progress on generative models has led to significant advances on text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet the motion controllability of generated videos remains limited. Existing motion transfer methods explored the motion representations of reference videos to guide generation. Nevertheless, these methods typically rely on sample-specific optimization strategy, resulting in high computational burdens. In this paper, we propose \textbf{EfficientMT}, a novel and efficient end-to-end framework for video motion transfer. By leveraging a small set of synthetic paired motion transfer samples, EfficientMT effectively adapts a pretrained T2V model into a general motion transfer framework that can accurately capture and reproduce diverse motion patterns. Specifically, we repurpose the backbone of the T2V model to extract temporal information from reference videos, and further propose a scaler module to distill motion-related information. Subsequently, we introduce a temporal integration mechanism that seamlessly incorporates reference motion features into the video generation process. After training on our self-collected synthetic paired samples, EfficientMT enables general video motion transfer without requiring test-time optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our EfficientMT outperforms existing methods in efficiency while maintaining flexible motion controllability. Our code will be available https://github.com/PrototypeNx/EfficientMT.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-VLM: Kinematic Instruction Tuning for Spatio-Temporal Reasoning in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19355v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal reasoning is essential in understanding real-world environments in various fields, eg, autonomous driving and sports analytics. Recent advances have improved the spatial reasoning ability of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) by introducing large-scale data, but these models still struggle to analyze kinematic elements like traveled distance and speed of moving objects. To bridge this gap, we construct a spatio-temporal reasoning dataset and benchmark involving kinematic instruction tuning, referred to as STKit and STKit-Bench. They consist of real-world videos with 3D annotations, detailing object motion dynamics: traveled distance, speed, movement direction, inter-object distance comparisons, and relative movement direction. To further scale such data construction to videos without 3D labels, we propose an automatic pipeline to generate pseudo-labels using 4D reconstruction in real-world scale. With our kinematic instruction tuning data for spatio-temporal reasoning, we present ST-VLM, a VLM enhanced for spatio-temporal reasoning, which exhibits outstanding performance on STKit-Bench. Furthermore, we show that ST-VLM generalizes robustly across diverse domains and tasks, outperforming baselines on other spatio-temporal benchmarks (eg, ActivityNet, TVQA+). Finally, by integrating learned spatio-temporal reasoning with existing abilities, ST-VLM enables complex multi-step reasoning. Project page: https://ikodoh.github.io/ST-VLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhiNets: Brain-inspired Non-contrastive Learning Based on Temporal Prediction Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14650v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding is a theory which hypothesises that cortex predicts sensory inputs at various levels of abstraction to minimise prediction errors. Inspired by predictive coding, Chen et al. (2024) proposed another theory, temporal prediction hypothesis, to claim that sequence memory residing in hippocampus has emerged through predicting input signals from the past sensory inputs. Specifically, they supposed that the CA3 predictor in hippocampus creates synaptic delay between input signals, which is compensated by the following CA1 predictor. Though recorded neural activities were replicated based on the temporal prediction hypothesis, its validity has not been fully explored. In this work, we aim to explore the temporal prediction hypothesis from the perspective of self-supervised learning. Specifically, we focus on non-contrastive learning, which generates two augmented views of an input image and predicts one from another. Non-contrastive learning is intimately related to the temporal prediction hypothesis because the synaptic delay is implicitly created by StopGradient. Building upon a popular non-contrastive learner, SimSiam, we propose PhiNet, an extension of SimSiam to have two predictors explicitly corresponding to the CA3 and CA1, respectively. Through studying the PhiNet model, we discover two findings. First, meaningful data representations emerge in PhiNet more stably than in SimSiam. This is initially supported by our learning dynamics analysis: PhiNet is more robust to the representational collapse. Second, PhiNet adapts more quickly to newly incoming patterns in online and continual learning scenarios. For practitioners, we additionally propose an extension called X-PhiNet integrated with a momentum encoder, excelling in continual learning. All in all, our work reveals that the temporal prediction hypothesis is a reasonable model in terms of the robustness and adaptivity.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[STOP: Integrated Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Prompting for Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15973v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained on tremendous image-text pairs, vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated promising zero-shot generalization across numerous image-based tasks. However, extending these capabilities to video tasks remains challenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent video prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing learnable prompts, but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all video sequences, overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial variations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the model's ability to capture essential temporal information for effective video understanding. To address this, we propose an integrated Spatial-TempOral dynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules, the intra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our intra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative regions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal variation, allowing the model to focus on areas with substantial temporal dynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally, to highlight the varying importance of frames for video understanding, we further introduce inter-frame temporal prompts, dynamically inserting prompts between frames with high temporal variance as measured by frame similarity. This enables the model to prioritize key frames and enhances its capacity to understand temporal dependencies across sequences. Extensive experiments on various video benchmarks demonstrate that STOP consistently achieves superior performance against state-of-the-art methods. The code is available at https://github.com/zhoujiahuan1991/CVPR2025-STOP.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by transformer architectures, we introduce the Temporal-Feature Cross Attention Mechanism (TFCAM), a novel deep learning framework designed to capture dynamic interactions among clinical features across time, enhancing both predictive accuracy and interpretability. In an experiment with 1,422 patients with Chronic Kidney Disease, predicting progression to End-Stage Renal Disease, TFCAM outperformed LSTM and RETAIN baselines, achieving an AUROC of 0.95 and an F1-score of 0.69. Beyond performance gains, TFCAM provides multi-level explainability by identifying critical temporal periods, ranking feature importance, and quantifying how features influence each other across time before affecting predictions. Our approach addresses the "black box" limitations of deep learning in healthcare, offering clinicians transparent insights into disease progression mechanisms while maintaining state-of-the-art predictive performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, submitted to AMIA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13059v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modeling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages loss masking and curriculum learning to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Unlike prior methods that add extra architectural components to learn unbiased estimators, we propose an impartial training objective that reduces the dominance of head classes during learning and focuses on underrepresented tail relationships. Our curriculum-driven mask generation strategy further empowers the model to adaptively adjust its bias mitigation strategy over time, enabling more balanced and robust estimations. To thoroughly assess performance under various distribution shifts, we also introduce two new tasks Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation offering a challenging benchmark for evaluating the resilience of STSG models. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate the superior unbiased performance and robustness of our method compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

Continuously updating models to avoid degradation is expensive. Can models be adapted without updating model weights? We present TARDIS, an unsupervised representation editing method that addresses this challenge. TARDIS extracts steering vectors from unlabeled data and adjusts the model's representations to better align with the target time period's distribution. Our experiments reveal that TARDIS enhances downstream task performance without the need for fine-tuning, can mitigate temporal misalignment even when exact target time period data is unavailable, and remains efficient even when the temporal information of the target data points is unknown at inference time.</p></details> |  |

Compared to its predecessor SV4D, SV4D 2.0 is more robust to occlusions and large motion, generalizes better to real-world videos, and produces higher-quality outputs in terms of detail sharpness and spatio-temporal consistency. We achieve this by introducing key improvements in multiple aspects: 1) network architecture: eliminating the dependency of reference multi-views and designing blending mechanism for 3D and frame attention, 2) data: enhancing quality and quantity of training data, 3) training strategy: adopting progressive 3D-4D training for better generalization, and 4) 4D optimization: handling 3D inconsistency and large motion via 2-stage refinement and progressive frame sampling. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance gain by SV4D 2.0 both visually and quantitatively, achieving better detail (-14\% LPIPS) and 4D consistency (-44\% FV4D) in novel-view video synthesis and 4D optimization (-12\% LPIPS and -24\% FV4D) compared to SV4D.

However, existing atomic activity datasets are collected from an egocentric view, which cannot support the scenarios where traffic activities in an entire intersection are required. Moreover, existing datasets only provide video-level atomic activity annotations, which require exhausting efforts to manually trim the videos for recognition and limit their applications to untrimmed videos. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Aerial Traffic Atomic Activity Recognition and Segmentation (ATARS) dataset, the first aerial dataset designed for multi-label atomic activity analysis. We offer atomic activity labels for each frame, which accurately record the intervals for traffic activities. Moreover, we propose a novel task, Multi-label Temporal Atomic Activity Recognition, enabling the study of accurate temporal localization for atomic activity and easing the burden of manual video trimming for recognition. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate existing state-of-the-art models on both atomic activity recognition and temporal atomic activity segmentation. The results highlight the unique challenges of our ATARS dataset, such as recognizing extremely small objects' activities. We further provide comprehensive discussion analyzing these challenges and offer valuable insights for future direction to improve recognizing atomic activity in aerial view.

In this paper, we establish a novel error analysis for parametric finite element approximations of genus-1 axisymmetric mean curvature flow, formulated using two classical second-order time-stepping methods: the Crank-Nicolson method and the BDF2 method. Our results establish optimal error bounds in both the L^2-norm and H^1-norm, along with a superconvergence result in the H^1-norm for each fully discrete approximation. Finally, we perform convergence experiments to validate the theoretical findings and present numerical simulations for various genus-1 surfaces. Through a series of comparative experiments, we also demonstrate that the methods proposed in this paper exhibit significant mesh advantages.</p></details> |  |

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed, existing methods struggle with storage demands and representing complex real-world motions. To tackle these issues, we propose MoDecGS, a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed for reconstructing novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce GlobaltoLocal Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarsetofine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS), extending static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS, we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions, by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes which are anchor position, offset, and local context features. Next, we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally, we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training, allowing MoDecGS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDecGS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over stateoftheart methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from realworld dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 (camera ready ver.).

These videos inherently exhibit long-tailed distributions, where actions vary widely in frequency and duration. In temporal action segmentation approaches, we identified a bi-level learning bias. This bias encompasses (1) a class-level bias, stemming from class imbalance favoring head classes, and (2) a transition-level bias arising from variations in transitions, prioritizing commonly observed transitions. As a remedy, we introduce a constrained optimization problem to alleviate both biases. We define learning states for action classes and their associated transitions and integrate them into the optimization process. We propose a novel cost-sensitive loss function formulated as a weighted cross-entropy loss, with weights adaptively adjusted based on the learning state of actions and their transitions. Experiments on three challenging temporal segmentation benchmarks and various frameworks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, resulting in significant improvements in both per-class frame-wise and segment-wise performance.</p></details> | BMCV 2024 |
| **[SPMTrack: Spatio-Temporal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Mixture of Experts for Scalable Visual Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18338v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most state-of-the-art trackers adopt one-stream paradigm, using a single Vision Transformer for joint feature extraction and relation modeling of template and search region images. However, relation modeling between different image patches exhibits significant variations. For instance, background regions dominated by target-irrelevant information require reduced attention allocation, while foreground, particularly boundary areas, need to be be emphasized. A single model may not effectively handle all kinds of relation modeling simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel tracker called SPMTrack based on mixture-of-experts tailored for visual tracking task (TMoE), combining the capability of multiple experts to handle diverse relation modeling more flexibly. Benefiting from TMoE, we extend relation modeling from image pairs to spatio-temporal context, further improving tracking accuracy with minimal increase in model parameters. Moreover, we employ TMoE as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method, substantially reducing trainable parameters, which enables us to train SPMTrack of varying scales efficiently and preserve the generalization ability of pretrained models to achieve superior performance. We conduct experiments on seven datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers.

Text-to-video generation has made remarkable progress over the past year, but the absence of harmonious audio in generated video limits its broader applications. In this paper, we propose Semantic and Temporal Aligned Video-to-Audio (STA-V2A), an approach that enhances audio generation from videos by extracting both local temporal and global semantic video features and combining these refined video features with text as cross-modal guidance. To address the issue of information redundancy in videos, we propose an onset prediction pretext task for local temporal feature extraction and an attentive pooling module for global semantic feature extraction. To supplement the insufficient semantic information in videos, we propose a Latent Diffusion Model with Text-to-Audio priors initialization and cross-modal guidance. We also introduce Audio-Audio Align, a new metric to assess audio-temporal alignment. Subjective and objective metrics demonstrate that our method surpasses existing Video-to-Audio models in generating audio with better quality, semantic consistency, and temporal alignment. The ablation experiment validated the effectiveness of each module.

To address this, we propose $\textbf{ReTaKe}$, a training-free method with two novel modules DPSelect and PivotKV, to jointly reduce both temporal visual redundancy and knowledge redundancy for video compression. To align with the way of human temporal perception, DPSelect identifies keyframes based on inter-frame distance peaks. To leverage LLMs' learned prior knowledge, PivotKV marks the keyframes as pivots and compress non-pivot frames by pruning low-attention tokens in their KV cache. ReTaKe enables VideoLLMs to process 8 times longer frames (up to 2048), outperforming similar-sized models by 3-5% and even rivaling much larger ones on VideoMME, MLVU, LongVideoBench, and LVBench. Moreover, by overlapping compression operations with prefilling, ReTaKe introduces only ~10% prefilling latency overhead while reducing decoding latency by ~20%.

We address the task of extracting clinical events and their temporal relations using the well-studied I2B2 2012 Temporal Relations Challenge corpus. This task is inherently challenging due to complex clinical language, long documents, and sparse annotations. We introduce GRAPHTREX, a novel method integrating span-based entity-relation extraction, clinical large pre-trained language models (LPLMs), and Heterogeneous Graph Transformers (HGT) to capture local and global dependencies. Our HGT component facilitates information propagation across the document through innovative global landmarks that bridge distant entities.

Neural architecture search (NAS), which automates the neural network design, has been shown effective in tackling the STSF problem. However, the existing NAS methods for STSF focus on generating architectures in a time-consuming data-driven fashion, which heavily limits their ability to use background knowledge and explore the complicated search trajectory. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable ability in decision-making with comprehensive internal world knowledge, but how it could benefit NAS for STSF remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel NAS method for STSF based on LLM. Instead of directly generate architectures with LLM, We inspire the LLM's capability with a multi-level enhancement mechanism. Specifically, on the step-level, we decompose the generation task into decision steps with powerful prompt engineering and inspire LLM to serve as instructor for architecture search based on its internal knowledge. On the instance-level, we utilize a one-step tuning framework to quickly evaluate the architecture instance and a memory bank to cumulate knowledge to improve LLM's search ability. On the task-level, we propose a two-stage architecture search, balancing the exploration stage and optimization stage, to reduce the possibility of being trapped in local optima. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve competitive effectiveness with superior efficiency against existing NAS methods for STSF.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, semi-supervised methods have gained popularity due to their significant reduction in annotation labor and time costs. Current semi-supervised methods typically focus on point cloud spatial distribution or consider short-term temporal representations, e.g., only two adjacent frames, often overlooking the rich long-term temporal properties inherent in autonomous driving scenarios. In driving experience, we observe that nearby objects, such as roads and vehicles, remain stable while driving, whereas distant objects exhibit greater variability in category and shape. This natural phenomenon is also captured by LiDAR, which reflects lower temporal sensitivity for nearby objects and higher sensitivity for distant ones. To leverage these characteristics, we propose HiLoTs, which learns high-temporal sensitivity and low-temporal sensitivity representations from continuous LiDAR frames. These representations are further enhanced and fused using a cross-attention mechanism. Additionally, we employ a teacher-student framework to align the representations learned by the labeled and unlabeled branches, effectively utilizing the large amounts of unlabeled data. Experimental results on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that our proposed HiLoTs outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods, and achieves performance close to LiDAR+Camera multimodal approaches.

However, existing technologies are primarily based on visual cues, facing serious challenges in non-light-of-sight and privacy-sensitive in-bed scenes. Pressure-sensing bedsheets offer a promising solution for real-time motion reconstruction. Yet, limited exploration in model designs and data have hindered its further development. To tackle these issues, we propose a general framework that bridges gaps in data annotation and model design. Firstly, we introduce SMPLify-IB, an optimization method that overcomes the depth ambiguity issue in top-view scenarios through gravity constraints, enabling generating high-quality 3D human shape annotations for in-bed datasets. Then we present PI-HMR, a temporal-based human shape estimator to regress meshes from pressure sequences.

However, the lack of temporal knowledge in the pre-trained model introduces a domain gap which may adversely affect the VIS performance. To effectively bridge this gap, we present a novel video pre-training approach to enhance VIS models, especially for videos with intricate instance relationships. Our crucial innovation focuses on reducing disparities between the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Specifically, we first introduce consistent pseudo-video augmentations to create diverse pseudo-video samples for pre-training while maintaining the instance consistency across frames. Then, we incorporate a multi-scale temporal module to enhance the model's ability to model temporal relations through self- and cross-attention at short- and long-term temporal spans. Our approach does not set constraints on model architecture and can integrate seamlessly with various VIS methods. Experiment results on commonly adopted VIS benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieves a notable 4.0% increase in average precision on the challenging OVIS dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5figures, 6 tables, Accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Sentinel: Multi-Patch Transformer with Temporal and Channel Attention for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17658v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based time series forecasting has recently gained strong interest due to the ability of transformers to model sequential data. Most of the state-of-the-art architectures exploit either temporal or inter-channel dependencies, limiting their effectiveness in multivariate time-series forecasting where both types of dependencies are crucial. We propose Sentinel, a full transformer-based architecture composed of an encoder able to extract contextual information from the channel dimension, and a decoder designed to capture causal relations and dependencies across the temporal dimension. Additionally, we introduce a multi-patch attention mechanism, which leverages the patching process to structure the input sequence in a way that can be naturally integrated into the transformer architecture, replacing the multi-head splitting process. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that Sentinel, because of its ability to "monitor" both the temporal and the inter-channel dimension, achieves better or comparable performance with respect to state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Temporal Consistency Learning for Point-supervised Natural Language Video Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17651v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural language video localization (NLVL) is a crucial task in video understanding that aims to localize the target moment in videos specified by a given language description. Recently, a point-supervised paradigm has been presented to address this task, requiring only a single annotated frame within the target moment rather than complete temporal boundaries. Compared with the fully-supervised paradigm, it offers a balance between localization accuracy and annotation cost. However, due to the absence of complete annotation, it is challenging to align the video content with language descriptions, consequently hindering accurate moment prediction. To address this problem, we propose a new COllaborative Temporal consistEncy Learning (COTEL) framework that leverages the synergy between saliency detection and moment localization to strengthen the video-language alignment. Specifically, we first design a frame- and a segment-level Temporal Consistency Learning (TCL) module that models semantic alignment across frame saliencies and sentence-moment pairs. Then, we design a cross-consistency guidance scheme, including a Frame-level Consistency Guidance (FCG) and a Segment-level Consistency Guidance (SCG), that enables the two temporal consistency learning paths to reinforce each other mutually. Further, we introduce a Hierarchical Contrastive Alignment Loss (HCAL) to comprehensively align the video and text query. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that our method performs favorably against SoTA approaches. We will release all the source codes.</p></details> | Under review |

Despite its importance, conventional LVEF estimation remains time-consuming and operator-dependent. Recent deep learning advancements have enhanced automation, yet many existing models are computationally demanding, hindering their feasibility for real-time clinical applications. Additionally, the interplay between spatial and temporal features is crucial for accurate estimation but is often overlooked. In this work, we propose Echo-E$^3$Net, an efficient Endo-Epi spatio-temporal network tailored for LVEF estimation. Our method introduces the Endo-Epi Cardial Border Detector (E$^2$CBD) module, which enhances feature extraction by leveraging spatial and temporal landmark cues. Complementing this, the Endo-Epi Feature Aggregator (E$^2$FA) distills statistical descriptors from backbone feature maps, refining the final EF prediction. These modules, along with a multi-component loss function tailored to align with the clinical definition of EF, collectively enhance spatial-temporal representation learning, ensuring robust and efficient EF estimation. We evaluate Echo-E$^3$Net on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, achieving a RMSE of 5.15 and an R$^2$ score of 0.82, setting a new benchmark in efficiency with 6.8 million parameters and only 8.49G Flops.

However, many existing FedRL algorithms assume that all agents operate in identical environments, which is often unrealistic. In real-world applications -- such as multi-robot teams, crowdsourced systems, and large-scale sensor networks -- each agent may experience slightly different transition dynamics, leading to inherent model mismatches. In this paper, we first establish linear convergence guarantees for single-agent temporal difference learning (TD(0)) in policy evaluation and demonstrate that under a perturbed environment, the agent suffers a systematic bias that prevents accurate estimation of the true value function. This result holds under both i.i.d. and Markovian sampling regimes. We then extend our analysis to the federated TD(0) (FedTD(0)) setting, where multiple agents -- each interacting with its own perturbed environment -- periodically share value estimates to collaboratively approximate the true value function of a common underlying model. Our theoretical results indicate the impact of model mismatch, network connectivity, and mixing behavior on the convergence of FedTD(0). Empirical experiments corroborate our theoretical gains, highlighting that even moderate levels of information sharing can significantly mitigate environment-specific errors.</p></details> |  |

Traditional detection methods, including statistical and rule-based models, struggle to adapt to evolving attack patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Temporal-Spatial Attention Network (TSAN) architecture for detecting Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in network traffic. By leveraging both temporal and spatial features of network traffic, our approach captures complex traffic patterns and anomalies that traditional methods might miss. The TSAN model incorporates transformer-based temporal encoding, convolutional spatial encoding, and a cross-attention mechanism to fuse these complementary feature spaces. Additionally, we employ multi-task learning with auxiliary tasks to enhance the model's robustness. Experimental results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate that TSAN outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score while maintaining computational efficiency for real-time deployment. The proposed architecture offers an optimal balance between detection accuracy and computational overhead, making it highly suitable for real-world network security applications.</p></details> | 19 Pages, 5 figures |

This study investigates how mimicry differs across emotions using Face Action Units from videos and participants' responses. Dynamic Time Warping quantified the temporal alignment between participants' and stimuli's facial expressions, revealing significant emotional variations. Post-hoc tests indicated greater mimicry for 'Fear' than 'Happy' and reduced mimicry for 'Anger' compared to 'Fear'. The mimicry correlations with personality traits like Extraversion and Agreeableness were significant, showcasing subtle yet meaningful connections. These findings suggest specific emotions evoke stronger mimicry, with personality traits playing a secondary role in emotional alignment. Notably, our results highlight how personality-linked mimicry mechanisms extend beyond interpersonal communication to affective computing applications, such as remote human-human interactions and human-virtual-agent scenarios. Insights from temporal facial mimicry - e.g., designing digital agents that adaptively mirror user expressions - enable developers to create empathetic, personalized systems, enhancing emotional resonance and user engagement.</p></details> |  |

The unique feature of event cameras in capturing only the outlines of motion, combined with SNNs' proficiency in processing spatiotemporal data through spikes, establishes a highly synergistic compatibility for event-based HAR. Previous studies, however, have been limited by SNNs' ability to process long-term temporal information, essential for precise HAR. In this paper, we introduce two novel frameworks to address this: temporal segment-based SNN (\textit{TS-SNN}) and 3D convolutional SNN (\textit{3D-SNN}). The \textit{TS-SNN} extracts long-term temporal information by dividing actions into shorter segments, while the \textit{3D-SNN} replaces 2D spatial elements with 3D components to facilitate the transmission of temporal information. To promote further research in event-based HAR, we create a dataset, \textit{FallingDetection-CeleX}, collected using the high-resolution CeleX-V event camera $(1280 \times 800)$, comprising 7 distinct actions. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed frameworks surpass state-of-the-art SNN methods on our newly collected dataset and three other neuromorphic datasets, showcasing their effectiveness in handling long-range temporal information for event-based HAR.</p></details> |  |

However, they struggle to extend this visual understanding to tasks requiring precise temporal localization, known as Video Temporal Grounding (VTG). To address this gap, we introduce Number-Prompt (NumPro), a novel method that empowers Vid-LLMs to bridge visual comprehension with temporal grounding by adding unique numerical identifiers to each video frame. Treating a video as a sequence of numbered frame images, NumPro transforms VTG into an intuitive process: flipping through manga panels in sequence. This allows Vid-LLMs to "read" event timelines, accurately linking visual content with corresponding temporal information. Our experiments demonstrate that NumPro significantly boosts VTG performance of top-tier Vid-LLMs without additional computational cost. Furthermore, fine-tuning on a NumPro-enhanced dataset defines a new state-of-the-art for VTG, surpassing previous top-performing methods by up to 6.9\% in mIoU for moment retrieval and 8.5\% in mAP for highlight detection.

However, their performance on temporal questions and historical knowledge is limited because they often cannot understand temporal scope and orientation or neglect the temporal aspect altogether. In this study, we aim to measure precisely how robust LLMs are for question answering based on their ability to process temporal information and perform tasks requiring temporal reasoning and temporal factual knowledge. Specifically, we design eight time-sensitive robustness tests for factual information to check the sensitivity of six popular LLMs in the zero-shot setting. Overall, we find LLMs lacking temporal robustness, especially to temporal reformulations and the use of different granularities of temporal references. We show how a selection of these eight tests can be used automatically to judge a model's temporal robustness for user questions on the fly. Finally, we apply the findings of this study to improve the temporal QA performance by up to 55 percent.</p></details> | 8 pages |

However, existing approaches struggle with temporal reasoning due to weak temporal correspondence in the data and reliance on the next-token prediction paradigm during training. To address these limitations, we propose TEMPO (TEMporal Preference Optimization), a systematic framework that enhances Video LLMs' temporal reasoning capabilities through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). To facilitate this, we introduce an automated preference data generation pipeline that systematically constructs preference pairs by selecting videos that are rich in temporal information, designing video-specific perturbation strategies, and finally evaluating model responses on clean and perturbed video inputs. Our temporal alignment features two key innovations: curriculum learning which that progressively increases perturbation difficulty to improve model robustness and adaptability; and ``Pre-SFT Alignment'', applying preference optimization before instruction tuning to prioritize fine-grained temporal comprehension. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently improves Video LLM performance across multiple benchmarks with a relatively small set of self-generated DPO data. We further analyze the transferability of DPO data across architectures and the role of difficulty scheduling in optimization. Our findings highlight our TEMPO as a scalable and efficient complement to SFT-based methods, paving the way for developing reliable Video LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, recent improvements in model performance, driven by larger feature extractors and datasets, have led to increased computational demands. This presents a challenge for applications like autonomous driving and robotics, which rely on limited computational resources. While existing channel pruning methods can compress these models, reducing the number of channels often hinders the parallelization efficiency of GPU, due to the inefficient multiplication between small matrices. Instead of pruning channels, we propose a Progressive Block Drop method that reduces model depth while retaining layer width. In this way, we still use large matrices for computation but reduce the number of multiplications. Our approach iteratively removes redundant blocks in two steps: first, we drop blocks with minimal impact on model performance; and second, we employ a parameter-efficient cross-depth alignment technique, fine-tuning the pruned model to restore model accuracy. Our method achieves a 25% reduction in computational overhead on two TAD benchmarks (THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3) to achieve lossless compression. More critically, we empirically show that our method is orthogonal to channel pruning methods and can be combined with it to yield further efficiency gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

To tackle these challenges, we propose TeMP-TraG, a novel graph neural network mechanism that incorporates temporal dynamics into message passing. TeMP-TraG prioritises more recent transactions when aggregating node messages, enabling better detection of time-sensitive patterns. We demonstrate that TeMP-TraG improves four state-of-the-art graph neural networks by 6.19% on average. Our results highlight TeMP-TraG as an advancement in leveraging transaction graphs to combat financial crime.</p></details> |  |

A key component in its hardware deployment is the ability to generate dynamic reservoir states. Our research introduces a novel dual-memory RC system, integrating a short-term memory via a WOx-based memristor, capable of achieving 16 distinct states encoded over 4 bits, and a long-term memory component using a TiOx-based memristor within the readout layer. We thoroughly examine both memristor types and leverage the RC system to process temporal data sets. The performance of the proposed RC system is validated through two benchmark tasks: isolated spoken digit recognition with incomplete inputs and Mackey-Glass time series prediction. The system delivered an impressive 98.84% accuracy in digit recognition and sustained a low normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) of 0.036 in the time series prediction task, underscoring its capability.

While multimodal learning has gained traction, existing multimodal time-series datasets fall short in evaluating cross-modal reasoning and complex question answering, which are essential for capturing complex interactions between narrative information and temporal patterns. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multimodal Time Series Benchmark (MTBench), a large-scale benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on time series and text understanding across financial and weather domains. MTbench comprises paired time series and textual data, including financial news with corresponding stock price movements and weather reports aligned with historical temperature records. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on isolated modalities, MTbench provides a comprehensive testbed for models to jointly reason over structured numerical trends and unstructured textual narratives. The richness of MTbench enables formulation of diverse tasks that require a deep understanding of both text and time-series data, including time-series forecasting, semantic and technical trend analysis, and news-driven question answering (QA). These tasks target the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies, extract key insights from textual context, and integrate cross-modal information. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on MTbench, analyzing their effectiveness in modeling the complex relationships between news narratives and temporal patterns. Our findings reveal significant challenges in current models, including difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies, interpreting causality in financial and weather trends, and effectively fusing multimodal information.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Existing SLR systems perform well for their cultural SL but may struggle with multi-cultural sign languages (McSL). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Stack Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network that leverages multi-head attention mechanisms to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies with hierarchical features using the Stack Transfer concept. In the proceed, firstly, we applied a fully connected layer to make a embedding vector which has high expressive power from the original dataset, then fed them a stack newly proposed transformer to achieve hierarchical features with short-range and long-range dependency. The network architecture is composed of several stages that process spatial and temporal relationships sequentially, ensuring effective feature extraction. After making the fully connected layer, the embedding vector is processed by the Spatial Multi-Head Attention Transformer, which captures spatial dependencies between joints. In the next stage, the Temporal Multi-Head Attention Transformer captures long-range temporal dependencies, and again, the features are concatenated with the output using another skip connection. The processed features are then passed to the Feed-Forward Network (FFN), which refines the feature representations further. After the FFN, additional skip connections are applied to combine the output with earlier layers, followed by a final normalization layer to produce the final output feature tensor. This process is repeated for 10 transformer blocks. The extensive experiment shows that the JSL, KSL and ASL datasets achieved good performance accuracy. Our approach demonstrates improved performance in McSL, and it will be consider as a novel work in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[elaTCSF: A Temporal Contrast Sensitivity Function for Flicker Detection and Modeling Variable Refresh Rate Flicker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16759v1)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The perception of flicker has been a prominent concern in illumination and electronic display fields for over a century. Traditional approaches often rely on Critical Flicker Frequency (CFF), primarily suited for high-contrast (full-on, full-off) flicker. To tackle varying contrast flicker, the International Committee for Display Metrology (ICDM) introduced a Temporal Contrast Sensitivity Function TCSF$_{IDMS}$ within the Information Display Measurements Standard (IDMS). Nevertheless, this standard overlooks crucial parameters: luminance, eccentricity, and area. Existing models incorporating these parameters are inadequate for flicker detection, especially at low spatial frequencies. To address these limitations, we extend the TCSF$_{IDMS}$ and combine it with a new spatial probability summation model to incorporate the effects of luminance, eccentricity, and area (elaTCSF). We train the elaTCSF on various flicker detection datasets and establish the first variable refresh rate flicker detection dataset for further verification. Additionally, we contribute to resolving a longstanding debate on whether the flicker is more visible in peripheral vision. We demonstrate how elaTCSF can be used to predict flicker due to low-persistence in VR headsets, identify flicker-free VRR operational ranges, and determine flicker sensitivity in lighting design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at SIGGRAPH Asia 2024</p></details> |

FIA produces estimates of area averages/totals for plot-measured forest variables through design-based inference, assuming a fixed population and a probability sample of field plot locations. The fixed-population assumption and characteristics of the FIA sampling scheme make it difficult to estimate change in forest variables over time using design-based inference. We propose spatial-temporal models based on Gaussian processes as a flexible tool for forest inventory data, capable of inferring forest variables and change thereof over arbitrary spatial and temporal domains. It is shown to be beneficial for the covariance function governing the latent Gaussian process to account for variation at multiple scales, separating spatially local variation from ecosystem-scale variation. We demonstrate a model for forest biomass density, inferring 20 years of biomass change within two US National Forests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal State-Space Modeling for fMRI Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13074v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning structured state space models, especially the Mamba architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements while maintaining linear complexity. In this study, we introduce functional spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders. Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the model to capture component-level and network-level information. Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based classification and regression tasks. We further show brain connectivities and dynamics that are crucial for the prediction. Our work reveals the substantial potential of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery.

| **[Whenever, Wherever: Towards Orchestrating Crowd Simulations with Spatio-Temporal Spawn Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16639v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic crowd simulations are essential for immersive virtual environments, relying on both individual behaviors (microscopic dynamics) and overall crowd patterns (macroscopic characteristics). While recent data-driven methods like deep reinforcement learning improve microscopic realism, they often overlook critical macroscopic features such as crowd density and flow, which are governed by spatio-temporal spawn dynamics, namely, when and where agents enter a scene. Traditional methods, like random spawn rates, stochastic processes, or fixed schedules, are not guaranteed to capture the underlying complexity or lack diversity and realism. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called nTPP-GMM that models spatio-temporal spawn dynamics using Neural Temporal Point Processes (nTPPs) that are coupled with a spawn-conditional Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) for agent spawn and goal positions. We evaluate our approach by orchestrating crowd simulations of three diverse real-world datasets with nTPP-GMM. Our experiments demonstrate the orchestration with nTPP-GMM leads to realistic simulations that reflect real-world crowd scenarios and allow crowd analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Score Analysis for Understanding and Correcting Diffusion Artifacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16218v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual artifacts remain a persistent challenge in diffusion models, even with training on massive datasets. Current solutions primarily rely on supervised detectors, yet lack understanding of why these artifacts occur in the first place. In our analysis, we identify three distinct phases in the diffusion generative process: Profiling, Mutation, and Refinement. Artifacts typically emerge during the Mutation phase, where certain regions exhibit anomalous score dynamics over time, causing abrupt disruptions in the normal evolution pattern. This temporal nature explains why existing methods focusing only on spatial uncertainty of the final output fail at effective artifact localization. Based on these insights, we propose ASCED (Abnormal Score Correction for Enhancing Diffusion), that detects artifacts by monitoring abnormal score dynamics during the diffusion process, with a trajectory-aware on-the-fly mitigation strategy that appropriate generation of noise in the detected areas. Unlike most existing methods that apply post hoc corrections, \eg, by applying a noising-denoising scheme after generation, our mitigation strategy operates seamlessly within the existing diffusion process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively reduces artifacts across diverse domains, matching or surpassing existing supervised methods without additional training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Explorability Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16328v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs extend ordinary graphs with discrete time that affects the availability of edges. We consider solving games played on temporal graphs where one player aims to explore the graph, i.e., visit all vertices. The complexity depends majorly on two factors: the presence of an adversary and how edge availability is specified. We demonstrate that on static graphs, where edges are always available, solving explorability games is just as hard as solving reachability games. In contrast, on temporal graphs, the complexity of explorability coincides with generalized reachability (NP-complete for one-player and PSPACE- complete for two player games). We further show that if temporal graphs are given symbolically, even one-player reachability and thus explorability and generalized reachability games are PSPACE-hard. For one player, all these are also solvable in PSPACE and for two players, they are in PSPACE, EXP and EXP, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Spatio-Temporal Predictors in the Presence of Missing and Heterogeneous Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01701v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning approaches achieve outstanding predictive performance in modeling modern data, despite the increasing complexity and scale. However, evaluating the quality of predictive models becomes more challenging, as traditional statistical assumptions often no longer hold. In particular, spatio-temporal data exhibit dependencies across both time and space, often involving nonlinear dynamics, non-stationarities, and missing observations. As a result, advanced predictors such as spatio-temporal graph neural networks require novel evaluation methodologies. This paper introduces a residual correlation analysis framework designed to assess the optimality of spatio-temporal predictive neural models, particularly in scenarios with incomplete and heterogeneous data. By leveraging the principle that residual correlation indicates information not captured by the model, this framework serves as a powerful tool to identify and localize regions in space and time where model performance can be improved. A key advantage of the proposed approach is its ability to operate under minimal assumptions, enabling robust evaluation of deep learning models applied to multivariate time series, even in the presence of missing and heterogeneous data. The methodology employs tailored spatio-temporal graphs to encode sparse spatial and temporal dependencies within the data and utilizes asymptotically distribution-free summary statistics to pinpoint time intervals and spatial regions where the model underperforms. The effectiveness of the proposed residual analysis is demonstrated through validation on both synthetic and real-world scenarios involving state-of-the-art predictive models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCKET-1: Mastering Open-World Interaction with Visual-Temporal Context Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17856v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. One critical issue is bridging the gap between discrete entities in low-level observations and the abstract concepts required for effective planning. A common solution is building hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language. However, language suffers from the inability to communicate detailed spatial information. We propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from past observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, supported by real-time object tracking from SAM-2. Our method unlocks the potential of VLMs, enabling them to tackle complex tasks that demand spatial reasoning. Experiments in Minecraft show that our approach enables agents to achieve previously unattainable tasks, with a $\mathbf{76}\%$ absolute improvement in open-world interaction performance. Codes and demos are now available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Copula-based spatio-temporal modeling of air pollutant data incorporating covariate dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15935v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Elevated levels of PM10 are known to cause severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, and, in extreme cases, cancer and mortality. Despite various reduction policies implemented across different sectors, PM10 concentrations in South Korea continue to exceed the annual recommended limits set by the World Health Organization. Spatio-temporal PM10 concentrations may exhibit both spatial and temporal dependencies. Additionally, interactions between PM10 and environmental factors can further influence the variability in PM10. Therefore, this study proposes a method that incorporates the spatio-temporal neighbors of covariates alongside those of PM10 by adopting an approach that explains spatio-temporal interactions through spatio-temporal neighbors. Vine copulas are used to integrate the pairwise dependence structures between a given location and its surrounding spatio-temporal neighbors. We applied the model to weekly average PM10 data from South Korea in 2019, using PM2.5 and CO as covariates. Given that all three variables exhibited skewness, we assumed the Gumbel and Generalized Extreme Value distributions as marginal distributions. The proposed model outperformed a traditional Bayesian spatio-temporal model, a kriging method, and an alternative copula-based approach, particularly in predicting the top 5% of extreme values, by effectively capturing tail dependencies crucial for extreme value analysis. This study highlights the importance of utilizing vine copulas to effectively model diverse dependency structures in spatio-temporal data while simultaneously accommodating spatial and temporal dimensions, including spatio-temporal dependencies among covariates. The results underscore the broader applicability of the proposed approach to other fields where complex dependency structures are present.</p></details> |  |
| **[BlockDance: Reuse Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal Features to Accelerate Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15927v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive generation capabilities, particularly with recent advancements leveraging transformer architectures to improve both visual and artistic quality. However, Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) continue to encounter challenges related to low inference speed, primarily due to the iterative denoising process. To address this issue, we propose BlockDance, a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales, BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features, referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation, thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore, considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features, we introduce BlockDance-Ada, a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models, achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |

We observe that existing Video-LLMs often suffer from action-scene hallucination due to two main factors. First, existing Video-LLMs intermingle spatial and temporal features by applying an attention operation across all tokens. Second, they use the standard Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which causes the text tokens to overemphasize certain types of tokens depending on their sequential orders. To address these issues, we introduce MASH-VLM, Mitigating Action-Scene Hallucination in Video-LLMs through disentangled spatial-temporal representations. Our approach includes two key innovations: (1) DST-attention, a novel attention mechanism that disentangles the spatial and temporal tokens within the LLM by using masked attention to restrict direct interactions between the spatial and temporal tokens; (2) Harmonic-RoPE, which extends the dimensionality of the positional IDs, allowing the spatial and temporal tokens to maintain balanced positions relative to the text tokens. To evaluate the action-scene hallucination in Video-LLMs, we introduce the UNSCENE benchmark with 1,320 videos and 4,078 QA pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MASH-VLM achieves state-of-the-art results on the UNSCENE benchmark, as well as on existing video understanding benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Accurate measurement of the AoP and HSD requires a structured process. This begins with identifying standardized ultrasound planes, followed by the detection of specific anatomical landmarks within the regions of the pubic symphysis and fetal head that correlate with the delivery parameters AoP and HSD. Finally, these measurements are derived based on the identified anatomical landmarks. Addressing the clinical demands and standard operation process outlined in the ISUOG guideline, we introduce the Sequential Spatial-Temporal Network (SSTN), the first interpretable model specifically designed for the video of intrapartum ultrasound analysis. The SSTN operates by first identifying ultrasound planes, then segmenting anatomical structures such as the pubic symphysis and fetal head, and finally detecting key landmarks for precise measurement of HSD and AoP. Furthermore, the cohesive framework leverages task-related information to improve accuracy and reliability. Experimental evaluations on clinical datasets demonstrate that SSTN significantly surpasses existing models, reducing the mean absolute error by 18% for AoP and 22% for HSD.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to 2025 IEEE 22nd International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI)</p></details> |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[Automatic Generation of Safety-compliant Linear Temporal Logic via Large Language Model: A Self-supervised Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15840v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring safety in cyber-physical systems (CPS) poses a significant challenge, especially when converting high-level tasks described by natural language into formal specifications like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). In particular, the compliance of formal languages with respect to safety restrictions imposed on CPS is crucial for system safety. In this paper, we introduce AutoSafeLTL, a self-supervised framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of safety-compliant LTL. Our approach integrates a Language Inclusion check with an automated counterexample-guided feedback and modification mechanism, establishing a pipeline that verifies the safety-compliance of the resulting LTL while preserving its logical consistency and semantic accuracy. To enhance the framework's understanding and correction capabilities, we incorporate two additional Agent LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoSafeLTL effectively guarantees safety-compliance for generated LTL, achieving a 0% violation rate against imposed safety constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youths with Autism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15821v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aggressive behavior, including aggression towards others and self-injury, occurs in up to 80% of children and adolescents with autism, making it a leading cause of behavioral health referrals and a major driver of healthcare costs. Predicting when autistic youth will exhibit aggression is challenging due to their communication difficulties. Many are minimally verbal or have poor emotional insight. Recent advances in Machine Learning and wearable biosensing enable short-term aggression predictions within a limited future window (typically one to three minutes). However, existing models do not estimate aggression probability within longer future windows nor the expected number of aggression onsets over such a period. To address these limitations, we employ Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) to model the generative process of aggressive behavior onsets in inpatient youths with autism. We hypothesize that aggressive behavior onsets follow a self-exciting process driven by short-term history, making them well-suited for Hawkes Point Process modeling. We establish a benchmark and demonstrate through Goodness-of-Fit statistics and predictive metrics that TPPs perform well modeling aggressive behavior onsets in inpatient youths with autism. Additionally, we gain insights into the onset generative process, like the branching factor near criticality, and suggest TPPs may enhance future clinical decision-making and preemptive interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Scientific Reports</p></details> |

The reachability graph of $\mathcal{G}$ is the directed graph $D=(V,A)$ with $(u,v)\in A$ if only if there is a temporal path from $u$ to $v$. We study the Reachability Graph Realizability (RGR) problem that asks whether a given directed graph $D=(V,A)$ is the reachability graph of some temporal graph. The question can be asked for undirected or directed temporal graphs, for reachability defined via strict or non-strict temporal paths, and with or without restrictions on $\lambda$ (proper, simple, or happy). Answering an open question posed by Casteigts et al. (Theoretical Computer Science 991 (2024)), we show that all variants of the problem are NP-complete, except for two variants that become trivial in the directed case. For undirected temporal graphs, we consider the complexity of the problem with respect to the solid graph, that is, the graph containing all edges that could potentially receive a label in any realization. We show that the RGR problem is polynomial-time solvable if the solid graph is a tree and fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the feedback edge set number of the solid graph. As we show, the latter parameter can presumably not be replaced by smaller parameters like feedback vertex set or treedepth, since the problem is W[2]-hard with respect to these parameters.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces U-Motion, a learning-based compression scheme for both PCV geometry and attributes. We propose a U-Structured inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates Top-Down (Fine-to-Coarse) Motion Propagation, Bottom-Up Motion Predictive Coding and Multi-scale Group Motion Compensation to enable accurate motion estimation and efficient motion compression at each scale. In addition, we design a multi-scale spatial-temporal predictive coding module to capture the cross-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition for dense dynamic point clouds and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.</p></details> |  |

Our characterization of the resource utilization of virtual machines (VMs) in Azure reveals that, while CPU is the main underutilized resource, we need to provide a solution to manage all resources holistically. We also observe that many VMs exhibit complementary temporal patterns, which can be leveraged to improve the oversubscription of underutilized resources. Based on these insights, we propose Coach: a system that exploits temporal patterns for all-resource oversubscription in cloud platforms. Coach uses long-term predictions and an efficient VM scheduling policy to exploit temporally complementary patterns. We introduce a new general-purpose VM type, called CoachVM, where we partition each resource allocation into a guaranteed and an oversubscribed portion. Coach monitors the oversubscribed resources to detect contention and mitigate any potential performance degradation. We focus on memory management, which is particularly challenging due to memory's sensitivity to contention and the overhead required to reassign it between CoachVMs. Our experiments show that Coach enables platforms to host up to ~26% more VMs with minimal performance degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 30th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 2 (ASPLOS'25). 15 pages</p></details> |

This approach was beneficial because it avoided case-specific transformations to a body-attached reference frame. Building on this, we now address the challenges of long time integration in velocity reconstruction and pressure recovery by extending this IBA framework with sequential learning strategies. Key difficulties for PINNs in long time integration include temporal sparsity, long temporal domains and rich spectral content. To tackle these, a moving boundary-enabled PINN is developed, proposing two sequential learning strategies: - a time marching with gradual increase in time domain size, however, this approach struggles with error accumulation over long time domains; and - a time decomposition which divides the temporal domain into smaller segments, combined with transfer learning it effectively reduces error propagation and computational complexity. The key findings for modelling of incompressible unsteady flows past a flapping airfoil include: - for quasi-periodic flows, the time decomposition approach with preferential spatio-temporal sampling improves accuracy and efficiency for pressure recovery and aerodynamic load reconstruction, and, - for long time domains, decomposing it into smaller temporal segments and employing multiple sub-networks, simplifies the problem ensuring stability and reduced network sizes. This study highlights the limitations of traditional PINNs for long time integration of flow-structure interaction problems and demonstrates the benefits of decomposition-based strategies for addressing error accumulation, computational cost, and complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[High Temporal Consistency through Semantic Similarity Propagation in Semi-Supervised Video Semantic Segmentation for Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15676v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation from RGB cameras is essential to the perception of autonomous flying vehicles. The stability of predictions through the captured videos is paramount to their reliability and, by extension, to the trustworthiness of the agents. In this paper, we propose a lightweight video semantic segmentation approach-suited to onboard real-time inference-achieving high temporal consistency on aerial data through Semantic Similarity Propagation across frames. SSP temporally propagates the predictions of an efficient image segmentation model with global registration alignment to compensate for camera movements. It combines the current estimation and the prior prediction with linear interpolation using weights computed from the features similarities of the two frames. Because data availability is a challenge in this domain, we propose a consistency-aware Knowledge Distillation training procedure for sparsely labeled datasets with few annotations. Using a large image segmentation model as a teacher to train the efficient SSP, we leverage the strong correlations between labeled and unlabeled frames in the same training videos to obtain high-quality supervision on all frames. KD-SSP obtains a significant temporal consistency increase over the base image segmentation model of 12.5% and 6.7% TC on UAVid and RuralScapes respectively, with higher accuracy and comparable inference speed. On these aerial datasets, KD-SSP provides a superior segmentation quality and inference speed trade-off than other video methods proposed for general applications and shows considerably higher consistency. The code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

It emphasizes the transition from convolutional architectures to transformer-based pre-trained models, underscoring their potential in global geospatial analysis. A workflow is presented for automatically generating geospatial datasets, enabling the creation of semantic segmentation datasets from various sources, including WMS/WMTS links, vectorial cartography, and OpenStreetMap (OSM) overpass-turbo requests. The developed code allows a fast dataset generation process for training machine learning models using openly available data without manual labelling. Using aerial imagery and vectorial data from the respective geographical offices of Madrid and Vienna, two datasets were generated for car and pedestrian surface detection. A transformer-based model was trained and evaluated for each city, demonstrating good accuracy values. The historical trend analysis involved applying the trained model to earlier images predating the availability of vectorial data 10 to 20 years, successfully identifying temporal trends in infrastructure for pedestrians and cars across different city areas. This technique is applicable for municipal governments to gather valuable data at a minimal cost.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Temporal Encoding Strategies for Energy Time Series Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15456v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In contemporary power systems, energy consumption prediction plays a crucial role in maintaining grid stability and resource allocation enabling power companies to minimize energy waste and avoid overloading the grid. While there are several research works on energy optimization, they often fail to address the complexities of real-time fluctuations and the cyclic pattern of energy consumption. This work proposes a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of predictive models by employing sinusoidal encoding on periodic features of time-series data. To demonstrate the increase in performance, several statistical and ensemble machine learning models were trained on an energy demand dataset, using the proposed sinusoidal encoding. The performance of these models was then benchmarked against identical models trained on traditional encoding methods. The results demonstrated a 12.6% improvement of Root Mean Squared Error (from 0.5497 to 0.4802) and a 7.8% increase in the R^2 score (from 0.7530 to 0.8118), indicating that the proposed encoding better captures the cyclic nature of temporal patterns than traditional methods. The proposed methodology significantly improves prediction accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications in smart grid systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Investigating shocking events in the Ethereum stablecoin ecosystem through temporal multilayer graph structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10614v2)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the dynamic landscape of the Web, we are witnessing the emergence of the Web3 paradigm, which dictates that platforms should rely on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies to sustain themselves and their profitability. Cryptocurrencies are characterised by high market volatility and susceptibility to substantial crashes, issues that require temporal analysis methodologies able to tackle the high temporal resolution, heterogeneity and scale of blockchain data. While existing research attempts to analyse crash events, fundamental questions persist regarding the optimal time scale for analysis, differentiation between long-term and short-term trends, and the identification and characterisation of shock events within these decentralised systems. This paper addresses these issues by examining cryptocurrencies traded on the Ethereum blockchain, with a spotlight on the crash of the stablecoin TerraUSD and the currency LUNA designed to stabilise it. Utilising complex network analysis and a multi-layer temporal graph allows the study of the correlations between the layers representing the currencies and system evolution across diverse time scales. The investigation sheds light on the strong interconnections among stablecoins pre-crash and the significant post-crash transformations. We identify anomalous signals before, during, and after the collapse, emphasising their impact on graph structure metrics and user movement across layers. This paper pioneers temporal, cross-chain graph analysis to explore a cryptocurrency collapse. It emphasises the importance of temporal analysis for studies on web-derived data and how graph-based analysis can enhance traditional econometric results. Overall, this research carries implications beyond its field, for example for regulatory agencies aiming to safeguard users from shocks and monitor investment risks for citizens and clients.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear Transactions on Web</p></details> |

Recent efforts typically adopt the Masked Video Modeling (MVM) paradigm, leading to significant progress on multiple video tasks. However, two critical challenges remain: 1) Without human annotations, the random temporal sampling introduces uncertainty, increasing the difficulty of model training. 2) Previous MVM methods primarily recover the masked patches in the pixel space, leading to insufficient information compression for downstream tasks. To address these challenges jointly, we propose a self-supervised framework that leverages Temporal Correspondence for video Representation learning (T-CoRe). For challenge 1), we propose a sandwich sampling strategy that selects two auxiliary frames to reduce reconstruction uncertainty in a two-side-squeezing manner. Addressing challenge 2), we introduce an auxiliary branch into a self-distillation architecture to restore representations in the latent space, generating high-level semantic representations enriched with temporal information. Experiments of T-CoRe consistently present superior performance across several downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness for video representation learning.

We introduce the task of one-shot medical video object segmentation, which requires separating foreground and background pixels throughout a video given only the mask annotation of the first frame. To address this problem, we propose a temporal contrastive memory network comprising image and mask encoders to learn feature representations, a temporal contrastive memory bank that aligns embeddings from adjacent frames while pushing apart distant ones to explicitly model inter-frame relationships and stores these features, and a decoder that fuses encoded image features and memory readouts for segmentation. We also collect a diverse, multi-source medical video dataset spanning various modalities and anatomies to benchmark this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in segmenting both seen and unseen structures from a single exemplar, showing ability to generalize from scarce labels. This highlights the potential to alleviate annotation burdens for medical video analysis. Code is available at https://github.com/MedAITech/TCMN.</p></details> | MICCAI 2024 Workshop |

By leveraging Knowledge Graphs (KGs), GraphRAG improves information retrieval for complex reasoning tasks, providing more precise and comprehensive retrieval and generating more accurate responses to QAs. However, most RAG methods fall short in addressing multi-step reasoning, particularly when both information extraction and inference are necessary. To address this limitation, this paper presents Knowledge Graph-Based Iterative Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-IRAG), a novel framework that integrates KGs with iterative reasoning to improve LLMs' ability to handle queries involving temporal and logical dependencies. Through iterative retrieval steps, KG-IRAG incrementally gathers relevant data from external KGs, enabling step-by-step reasoning. The proposed approach is particularly suited for scenarios where reasoning is required alongside dynamic temporal data extraction, such as determining optimal travel times based on weather conditions or traffic patterns. Experimental results show that KG-IRAG improves accuracy in complex reasoning tasks by effectively integrating external knowledge with iterative, logic-based retrieval. Additionally, three new datasets: weatherQA-Irish, weatherQA-Sydney, and trafficQA-TFNSW, are formed to evaluate KG-IRAG's performance, demonstrating its potential beyond traditional RAG applications.</p></details> | 14 pages, 4 figures |

Although recent zero-shot VR methods using pre-trained diffusion models (DMs) show good promise, they suffer from approximation errors during reverse diffusion and insufficient temporal consistency. Moreover, dealing with 3D video data, VR is inherently computationally intensive. In this paper, we advocate viewing the reverse process in DMs as a function and present a novel Maximum a Posterior (MAP) framework that directly parameterizes video frames in the seed space of DMs, eliminating approximation errors. We also introduce strategies to promote bilevel temporal consistency: semantic consistency by leveraging clustering structures in the seed space, and pixel-level consistency by progressive warping with optical flow refinements. Extensive experiments on multiple virtual reality tasks demonstrate superior visual quality and temporal consistency achieved by our method compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

We create this dataset by training deep learning-based segmentation models to identify these renewable energy installations from satellite imagery, then deploy them on over 13 trillion pixels covering the world. For each detected feature, we estimate the construction date and the preceding land use type. This dataset offers crucial insights into progress toward sustainable development goals and serves as a valuable resource for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders aiming to assess and promote effective strategies for renewable energy deployment. Our final spatial dataset includes 375,197 individual wind turbines and 86,410 solar PV installations. We aggregate our predictions to the country level -- estimating total power capacity based on construction date, solar PV area, and number of windmills -- and find an $r^2$ value of $0.96$ and $0.93$ for solar PV and onshore wind respectively compared to IRENA's most recent 2023 country-level capacity estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Context Awareness: A Defense Framework Against Multi-turn Manipulation Attacks on Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15560v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated multi-turn manipulation attacks, where adversaries strategically build context through seemingly benign conversational turns to circumvent safety measures and elicit harmful or unauthorized responses. These attacks exploit the temporal nature of dialogue to evade single-turn detection methods, representing a critical security vulnerability with significant implications for real-world deployments. This paper introduces the Temporal Context Awareness (TCA) framework, a novel defense mechanism designed to address this challenge by continuously analyzing semantic drift, cross-turn intention consistency and evolving conversational patterns. The TCA framework integrates dynamic context embedding analysis, cross-turn consistency verification, and progressive risk scoring to detect and mitigate manipulation attempts effectively. Preliminary evaluations on simulated adversarial scenarios demonstrate the framework's potential to identify subtle manipulation patterns often missed by traditional detection techniques, offering a much-needed layer of security for conversational AI systems. In addition to outlining the design of TCA , we analyze diverse attack vectors and their progression across multi-turn conversation, providing valuable insights into adversarial tactics and their impact on LLM vulnerabilities. Our findings underscore the pressing need for robust, context-aware defenses in conversational AI systems and highlight TCA framework as a promising direction for securing LLMs while preserving their utility in legitimate applications. We make our implementation available to support further research in this emerging area of AI security.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, IEEE CAI</p></details> |
| **[SplatVoxel: History-Aware Novel View Streaming without Temporal Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14698v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of novel view streaming from sparse-view videos, which aims to generate a continuous sequence of high-quality, temporally consistent novel views as new input frames arrive. However, existing novel view synthesis methods struggle with temporal coherence and visual fidelity, leading to flickering and inconsistency. To address these challenges, we introduce history-awareness, leveraging previous frames to reconstruct the scene and improve quality and stability. We propose a hybrid splat-voxel feed-forward scene reconstruction approach that combines Gaussian Splatting to propagate information over time, with a hierarchical voxel grid for temporal fusion. Gaussian primitives are efficiently warped over time using a motion graph that extends 2D tracking models to 3D motion, while a sparse voxel transformer integrates new temporal observations in an error-aware manner. Crucially, our method does not require training on multi-view video datasets, which are currently limited in size and diversity, and can be directly applied to sparse-view video streams in a history-aware manner at inference time. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in both static and streaming scene reconstruction, effectively reducing temporal artifacts and visual artifacts while running at interactive rates (15 fps with 350ms delay) on a single H100 GPU.

| **[Temporal Consistency for LLM Reasoning Process Error Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14495v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Verification is crucial for effective mathematical reasoning. We present a new temporal consistency method where verifiers iteratively refine their judgments based on the previous assessment. Unlike one-round verification or multi-model debate approaches, our method leverages consistency in a sequence of self-reflection actions to improve verification accuracy. Empirical evaluations across diverse mathematical process error identification benchmarks (Mathcheck, ProcessBench, and PRM800K) show consistent performance improvements over baseline methods. When applied to the recent DeepSeek R1 distilled models, our method demonstrates strong performance, enabling 7B/8B distilled models to outperform all 70B/72B models and GPT-4o on ProcessBench. Notably, the distilled 14B model with our method achieves performance comparable to Deepseek-R1. Our codes are available at https://github.com/jcguo123/Temporal-Consistency</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Text Semantics and Graph Structures for Temporal Text-attributed Graphs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14411v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graph neural networks (TGNNs) have shown remarkable performance in temporal graph modeling. However, real-world temporal graphs often possess rich textual information, giving rise to temporal text-attributed graphs (TTAGs). Such combination of dynamic text semantics and evolving graph structures introduces heightened complexity. Existing TGNNs embed texts statically and rely heavily on encoding mechanisms that biasedly prioritize structural information, overlooking the temporal evolution of text semantics and the essential interplay between semantics and structures for synergistic reinforcement. To tackle these issues, we present \textbf{{Cross}}, a novel framework that seamlessly extends existing TGNNs for TTAG modeling. The key idea is to employ the advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract the dynamic semantics in text space and then generate expressive representations unifying both semantics and structures. Specifically, we propose a Temporal Semantics Extractor in the {Cross} framework, which empowers the LLM to offer the temporal semantic understanding of node's evolving contexts of textual neighborhoods, facilitating semantic dynamics. Subsequently, we introduce the Semantic-structural Co-encoder, which collaborates with the above Extractor for synthesizing illuminating representations by jointly considering both semantic and structural information while encouraging their mutual reinforcement. Extensive experimental results on four public datasets and one practical industrial dataset demonstrate {Cross}'s significant effectiveness and robustness.</p></details> | Submit to ICML2025 |

However, acquiring diverse food items under varying conditions and generalizing to unseen food presents unique challenges. Existing methods that rely on surface-level geometric information (e.g., bounding box and pose) derived from visual cues (e.g., color, shape, and texture) often lacks adaptability and robustness, especially when foods share similar physical properties but differ in visual appearance. We employ imitation learning (IL) to learn a policy for food acquisition. Existing methods employ IL or Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a policy based on off-the-shelf image encoders such as ResNet-50. However, such representations are not robust and struggle to generalize across diverse acquisition scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach, IMRL (Integrated Multi-Dimensional Representation Learning), which integrates visual, physical, temporal, and geometric representations to enhance the robustness and generalizability of IL for food acquisition. Our approach captures food types and physical properties (e.g., solid, semi-solid, granular, liquid, and mixture), models temporal dynamics of acquisition actions, and introduces geometric information to determine optimal scooping points and assess bowl fullness. IMRL enables IL to adaptively adjust scooping strategies based on context, improving the robot's capability to handle diverse food acquisition scenarios. Experiments on a real robot demonstrate our approach's robustness and adaptability across various foods and bowl configurations, including zero-shot generalization to unseen settings. Our approach achieves improvement up to $35\%$ in success rate compared with the best-performing baseline. More details can be found on our website https://ruiiu.github.io/imrl.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Infant Language Acquisition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14341v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the words that a child is going to learn next can be useful for boosting language acquisition, and such predictions have been shown to be possible with both neural network techniques (looking at changes in the vocabulary state over time) and graph model (looking at data pertaining to the relationships between words). However, these models do not fully capture the complexity of the language learning process of an infant when used in isolation. In this paper, we examine how a model of language acquisition for infants and young children can be constructed and adapted for use in a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (STGCN), taking into account the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during child language learning. We introduce a novel approach for predicting child vocabulary acquisition, and evaluate the efficacy of such a model with respect to the different types of linguistic relationships that occur during language acquisition, resulting in insightful observations on model calibration and norm selection. An evaluation of this model found that the mean accuracy of models for predicting new words when using sensorimotor relationships (0.733) and semantic relationships (0.729) were found to be superior to that observed with a 2-layer Feed-forward neural network. Furthermore, the high recall for some relationships suggested that some relationships (e.g. visual) were superior in identifying a larger proportion of relevant words that a child should subsequently learn than others (such as auditory).</p></details> |  |
| **[VSTAR: Generative Temporal Nursing for Longer Dynamic Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13501v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite tremendous progress in the field of text-to-video (T2V) synthesis, open-sourced T2V diffusion models struggle to generate longer videos with dynamically varying and evolving content. They tend to synthesize quasi-static videos, ignoring the necessary visual change-over-time implied in the text prompt. At the same time, scaling these models to enable longer, more dynamic video synthesis often remains computationally intractable. To address this challenge, we introduce the concept of Generative Temporal Nursing (GTN), where we aim to alter the generative process on the fly during inference to improve control over the temporal dynamics and enable generation of longer videos. We propose a method for GTN, dubbed VSTAR, which consists of two key ingredients: 1) Video Synopsis Prompting (VSP) - automatic generation of a video synopsis based on the original single prompt leveraging LLMs, which gives accurate textual guidance to different visual states of longer videos, and 2) Temporal Attention Regularization (TAR) - a regularization technique to refine the temporal attention units of the pre-trained T2V diffusion models, which enables control over the video dynamics. We experimentally showcase the superiority of the proposed approach in generating longer, visually appealing videos over existing open-sourced T2V models. We additionally analyze the temporal attention maps realized with and without VSTAR, demonstrating the importance of applying our method to mitigate neglect of the desired visual change over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025.

In this study, we showcase how integrating eye-tracking data, temporal dynamics, and personality traits can substantially enhance the detection of both perceived and felt emotions. Seventy-three participants viewed short, speech-containing videos from the CREMA-D dataset, while being recorded for eye-tracking signals (pupil size, fixation patterns), Big Five personality assessments, and self-reported emotional states. Our neural network models combined these diverse inputs including stimulus emotion labels for contextual cues and yielded marked performance gains compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically, perceived valence predictions reached a macro F1-score of 0.76, and models incorporating personality traits and stimulus information demonstrated significant improvements in felt emotion accuracy. These results highlight the benefit of unifying physiological, individual and contextual factors to address the subjectivity and complexity of emotional expression. Beyond validating the role of user-specific data in capturing subtle internal states, our findings inform the design of future affective computing and human-agent systems, paving the way for more adaptive and cross-individual emotional intelligence in real-world interactions.</p></details> |  |

To support downstream tasks like autonomous control, these representations must be both compositional and temporally consistent. Existing approaches based on recurrent processing often lack long-term stability across frames because their training objective does not enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel object-level temporal contrastive loss for video object-centric models that explicitly promotes temporal consistency. Our method significantly improves the temporal consistency of the learned object-centric representations, yielding more reliable video decompositions that facilitate challenging downstream tasks such as unsupervised object dynamics prediction. Furthermore, the inductive bias added by our loss strongly improves object discovery, leading to state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming even weakly-supervised methods that leverage motion masks as additional cues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, they struggle to perform spatio-temporal video grounding. This limitation stems from two major challenges. Firstly, it is difficult to extract accurate spatio-temporal information of each frame in the video. Secondly, the substantial number of visual tokens makes it challenging to precisely map visual tokens of each frame to their corresponding spatial coordinates. To address these issues, we introduce SpaceVLLM, a MLLM endowed with spatio-temporal video grounding capability. Specifically, we adopt a set of interleaved Spatio-Temporal Aware Queries to capture temporal perception and dynamic spatial information. Moreover, we propose a Query-Guided Space Decoder to establish a corresponding connection between the queries and spatial coordinates. Additionally, due to the lack of spatio-temporal datasets, we construct the Unified Spatio-Temporal Grounding (Uni-STG) dataset, comprising 480K instances across three tasks. This dataset fully exploits the potential of MLLM to simultaneously facilitate localization in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpaceVLLM achieves the state-of-the-art performance across 11 benchmarks covering temporal, spatial, spatio-temporal and video understanding tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach. Our code, datasets and model will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Flexibility in Spiking Neural Networks: Towards Generalization Across Time Steps and Deployment Friendliness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17394v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), models inspired by neural mechanisms in the brain, allow for energy-efficient implementation on neuromorphic hardware. However, SNNs trained with current direct training approaches are constrained to a specific time step. This "temporal inflexibility" 1) hinders SNNs' deployment on time-step-free fully event-driven chips and 2) prevents energy-performance balance based on dynamic inference time steps. In this study, we first explore the feasibility of training SNNs that generalize across different time steps. We then introduce Mixed Time-step Training (MTT), a novel method that improves the temporal flexibility of SNNs, making SNNs adaptive to diverse temporal structures. During each iteration of MTT, random time steps are assigned to different SNN stages, with spikes transmitted between stages via communication modules. After training, the weights are deployed and evaluated on both time-stepped and fully event-driven platforms. Experimental results show that models trained by MTT gain remarkable temporal flexibility, friendliness for both event-driven and clock-driven deployment (nearly lossless on N-MNIST and 10.1% higher than standard methods on CIFAR10-DVS), enhanced network generalization, and near SOTA performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to report the results of large-scale SNN deployment on fully event-driven scenarios.</p></details> | 20 pages, ICLR 2025 |

Autonomous vehicles have come to increasingly interact with human drivers, and in many cases may pose risks to the physical or mental well-being of those they interact with. Meanwhile causal models, despite their inherent transparency and ability to offer contrastive explanations, have found limited usage within such systems. As such, we first identify the challenges that have limited the integration of structural causal models within autonomous vehicles. We then introduce a number of theoretical extensions to the structural causal model formalism in order to tackle these challenges. This augments these models to possess greater levels of modularisation and encapsulation, as well presenting temporal causal model representation with constant space complexity. We also prove through the extensions we have introduced that dynamically mutable sets (e.g. varying numbers of autonomous vehicles across time) can be used within a structural causal model while maintaining a relaxed form of causal stationarity. Finally we discuss the application of the extensions in the context of the autonomous vehicle and service robotics domain along with potential directions for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 Pa...</summary><p>30 Pages = 13 Pages (Main Content) + 4 Pages (References) + 13 Pages (Appendix), 15 Figures = 5 Figures (Main Content) + 10 (Appendix), To be published in the Proceedings of the 2025 Causal Learning and Reasoning Conference, Update upload of accepted paper version</p></details> |

In this work, we bring to light that current egocentric video question-answering datasets often include questions that can be answered using only few frames or commonsense reasoning, without being necessarily grounded in the actual video. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on these benchmarks achieve remarkably high performance using just text or a single frame as input. To address these limitations, we introduce EgoTempo, a dataset specifically designed to evaluate temporal understanding in the egocentric domain. EgoTempo emphasizes tasks that require integrating information across the entire video, ensuring that models would need to rely on temporal patterns rather than static cues or pre-existing knowledge. Extensive experiments on EgoTempo show that current MLLMs still fall short in temporal reasoning on egocentric videos, and thus we hope EgoTempo will catalyze new research in the field and inspire models that better capture the complexity of temporal dynamics.

The synthesized videos are evaluated on mainly two aspects, lip-speech synchronization and image fidelity. Recent studies demonstrate that GAN-based and diffusion-based models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on this task, with diffusion-based models achieving superior image fidelity but experiencing lower synchronization compared to their GAN-based counterparts. To this end, we propose SyncDiff, a simple yet effective approach to improve diffusion-based models using a temporal pose frame with information bottleneck and facial-informative audio features extracted from AVHuBERT, as conditioning input into the diffusion process. We evaluate SyncDiff on two canonical talking head datasets, LRS2 and LRS3 for direct comparison with other SOTA models. Experiments on LRS2/LRS3 datasets show that SyncDiff achieves a synchronization score 27.7%/62.3% relatively higher than previous diffusion-based methods, while preserving their high-fidelity characteristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

However, restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to low-resolution ODVs. Video super-resolution (SR) is proposed to enhance resolution, but practical ODV spatial projection distortions and temporal flickering are not well addressed directly applying existing methods. To achieve better ODV-SR reconstruction, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatially continuous distortion modulation module is introduced to improve discrete projection distortions. Next, we design an interlaced multi-frame reconstruction mechanism to refine temporal consistency across frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive weights during training to concentrate on regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In general, we explore inference-free and real-world viewing matched strategies to provide an application-friendly method on a novel ODV-SR dataset with practical scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed STDAN over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Signal Temporal Logic robustness-to-go (Ro-To-Go), a new quantitative semantics for the logic that isolates the contributions of suffix trajectories. We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC using traditional STL robustness. Our experiments show that using robustness-to-go results in a higher success rate.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce SPARTA, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. SPARTA introduces an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that produces an enriched representation of human motion over time. This approach ensures that the transformer's attention mechanism captures both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously, rather than focusing on only one aspect. The addition of the relative pose further emphasizes subtle deviations from normal human movements. The architecture's core, a novel Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPARTA consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches, including spatio-temporal graph convolutional networks (ST-GCNs), often face high memory demands and struggle to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies, limiting their efficiency in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we introduce DynSTG-Mamba (Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Mamba), a novel framework that combines DF-STGNN and STG-Mamba to enhance motion sequence modeling. The DF-STGNN incorporates a dynamic spatio-temporal filter that adaptively adjusts spatial connections between skeletal joints and temporal interactions across different movement phases. This approach ensures better feature propagation through dynamic graph structures by considering the hierarchical nature and dynamics of skeletal gait data. Meanwhile, STG-Mamba, an extension of Mamba adapted for skeletal motion data, ensures a continuous propagation of states, facilitating the capture of long-term dependencies while reducing computational complexity. To reduce the number of model parameters and computational costs while maintaining consistency, we propose Cross-Graph Relational Knowledge Distillation, a novel knowledge transfer mechanism that aligns relational information between teacher (large architecture) and student models (small architecture) while using shared memory. This ensures that the interactions and movement patterns of the joints are accurately preserved in the motion sequences. We validate our DynSTG-Mamba on KOA-NM, PD-WALK, and ATAXIA datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by achieving in terms of Accuracy, F1-score, and Recall. Our results highlight the efficiency and robustness of our approach, offering a lightweight yet highly accurate solution for automated gait analysis and movement disorder assessment.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods are designed for specific ball types and struggle to generalize. This challenge arises from three key factors. First, learning-based models require large datasets but suffer from accuracy drops in unseen scenarios. Second, physics-based models rely on complex formulas and detailed inputs, yet accurately obtaining ball states, such as spin, is often impractical. Third, integrating physical principles with neural networks to achieve high accuracy, fast inference, and strong generalization remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose an innovative approach that incorporates physics-based equations and neural networks. We first derive three generalized physical formulas. Then, using a neural network and observed trajectory points, we infer certain parameters while fitting the remaining ones. These formulas enable precise trajectory prediction with minimal training data: only a few dozen samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method superiority in generalization, real-time performance, and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission was made without my advisor's consent, and I mistakenly uploaded an incorrect version of the paper.

Latencies cause misalignments in both spatial and semantic features, complicating the fusion of real-time observations from the ego vehicle with delayed data from others. To address these issues, we propose TraF-Align, a novel framework that learns the flow path of features by predicting the feature-level trajectory of objects from past observations up to the ego vehicle's current time. By generating temporally ordered sampling points along these paths, TraF-Align directs attention from the current-time query to relevant historical features along each trajectory, supporting the reconstruction of current-time features and promoting semantic interaction across multiple frames. This approach corrects spatial misalignment and ensures semantic consistency across agents, effectively compensating for motion and achieving coherent feature fusion. Experiments on two real-world datasets, V2V4Real and DAIR-V2X-Seq, show that TraF-Align sets a new benchmark for asynchronous cooperative perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keep-out constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance.

| **[Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18929v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Unified Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion for Multi-Agent Trajectory Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18589v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory modeling has primarily focused on forecasting future states, often overlooking broader tasks like trajectory completion, which are crucial for real-world applications such as correcting tracking data. Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

| **[DiffMove: Group Mobility Tendency Enhanced Trajectory Recovery via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18302v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, trajectory data is often sparse and incomplete due to low collection frequencies or limited device coverage. Trajectory recovery aims to recover these missing trajectory points, making the trajectories denser and more complete. However, this task faces two key challenges: 1) The excessive sparsity of individual trajectories makes it difficult to effectively leverage historical information for recovery; 2) Sparse trajectories make it harder to capture complex individual mobility preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called DiffMove. Firstly, we harness crowd wisdom for trajectory recovery. Specifically, we construct a group tendency graph using the collective trajectories of all users and then integrate the group mobility trends into the location representations via graph embedding. This solves the challenge of sparse trajectories being unable to rely on individual historical trajectories for recovery. Secondly, we capture individual mobility preferences from both historical and current perspectives. Finally, we integrate group mobility tendencies and individual preferences into the spatiotemporal distribution of the trajectory to recover high-quality trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DiffMove outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis validates the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports with Derivative-Accumulating Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory data collected from domains such as team sports often suffer from missing values due to various factors. While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> |  |
| **[EF-3DGS: Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15392v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene reconstruction from casually captured videos has wide applications in real-world scenarios. With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

Using data from seven cohorts belonging to the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (LRPP), we present a Bayesian hierarchical multivariate approach that jointly models multiple longitudinal risk factors over time and across cohorts. Because few cohorts in our project cover the entire adult lifespan, our strategy uses information from all risk factors to increase precision for each risk factor trajectory and borrows information across cohorts to fill in unobserved risk factors. We develop novel diagnostic testing and model validation methods to ensure that our model robustly captures and maintains critical relationships over time and across risk factors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physically-Feasible Reactive Synthesis for Terrain-Adaptive Locomotion via Trajectory Optimization and Symbolic Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03071v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an integrated planning framework for quadrupedal locomotion over dynamically changing, unforeseen terrains. Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiNash-PF: A Particle Filtering Approach for Computing Multiple Local Generalized Nash Equilibria in Trajectory Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05554v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems frequently engage in complex multi-agent interactions, many of which are inherently multi-modal, meaning they can lead to multiple distinct outcomes. To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We leverage a game-theoretic planner to model interaction outcomes as equilibria where \emph{each equilibrium} corresponds to a distinct interaction \emph{mode}. We then develop an efficient algorithm to identify all the equilibria, allowing robots to reason about multiple interaction modes. More specifically, we formulate interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs) and model interaction outcomes by local Generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) of the game. CPTGs are a class of games for which a local GNE can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem where a potential function is minimized. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.</p></details> |  |

However, previous Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) methods leverage the pose cues implicitly, resulting in implausible predictions. To address this, we propose Locomotion Embodiment, a framework that explicitly evaluates the physical plausibility of the predicted trajectory by locomotion generation under the laws of physics. While the plausibility of locomotion is learned with an indifferentiable physics simulator, it is replaced by our differentiable Locomotion Value function to train an HTP network in a data-driven manner. In particular, our proposed Embodied Locomotion loss is beneficial for efficiently training a stochastic HTP network using multiple heads. Furthermore, the Locomotion Value filter is proposed to filter out implausible trajectories at inference. Experiments demonstrate that our method enhances even the state-of-the-art HTP methods across diverse datasets and problem settings.

The proposed system employs multiple UAVs equipped with dual-functional radar-communication capabilities to simultaneously perform target sensing and provide communication services to users. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of users while maintaining target sensing performance through coordinated beamforming and UAV trajectory design. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinated descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Then, the beamforming design problem is addressed using fractional programming, while the UAV trajectory is refined through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach achieves significant performance improvements in both communication throughput and sensing accuracy compared to conventional, separated designs. We also show that proper coordination of multiple UAVs through optimized trajectories and beamforming patterns can effectively balance the tradeoff between sensing and communication objectives.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

However, the role of data sampling techniques in offline RL has been overlooked despite its potential to enhance online RL performance. Recent research suggests applying sampling techniques directly to state-transitions does not consistently improve performance in offline RL. Therefore, in this study, we propose a memory technique, (Prioritized) Trajectory Replay (TR/PTR), which extends the sampling perspective to trajectories for more comprehensive information extraction from limited data. TR enhances learning efficiency by backward sampling of trajectories that optimizes the use of subsequent state information. Building on TR, we build the weighted critic target to avoid sampling unseen actions in offline training, and Prioritized Trajectory Replay (PTR) that enables more efficient trajectory sampling, prioritized by various trajectory priority metrics. We demonstrate the benefits of integrating TR and PTR with existing offline RL algorithms on D4RL. In summary, our research emphasizes the significance of trajectory-based data sampling techniques in enhancing the efficiency and performance of offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAMAS 2024, see https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/3635637.3662980</p></details> |

To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> | Submitted version |
| **[MagicMotion: Controllable Video Generation with Dense-to-Sparse Trajectory Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16421v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

| **[Loop Closure from Two Views: Revisiting PGO for Scalable Trajectory Estimation through Monocular Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Visual) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a fundamental challenge in enabling autonomous systems to navigate and understand large-scale environments. Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this problem, we introduce PoseTraj, a pose-aware video dragging model for generating 3D-aligned motion from 2D trajectories. Our method adopts a novel two-stage pose-aware pretraining framework, improving 3D understanding across diverse trajectories. Specifically, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset PoseTraj-10K, containing 10k videos of objects following rotational trajectories, and enhance the model perception of object pose changes by incorporating 3D bounding boxes as intermediate supervision signals. Following this, we fine-tune the trajectory-controlling module on real-world videos, applying an additional camera-disentanglement module to further refine motion accuracy. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only excels in 3D pose-aligned dragging for rotational trajectories but also outperforms existing baselines in trajectory accuracy and video quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, data and project page: https://robingg1.github.io/Pose-Traj/</p></details> |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We report on a soma design workshop that explored how our bodies could collide with telepresence robots, mobility aids, and a quadruped robot. Based on our findings, we employed soma trajectories to analyse collisions as extended experiences that negotiate key transitions of consent, preparation, launch, contact, ripple, sting, untangle, debris and reflect. We then employed these ideas to analyse two collision experiences, an accidental collision between a person and a drone, and the deliberate design of a robot to play with cats, revealing how real-world collisions involve the complex and ongoing entanglement of soma trajectories. We discuss how viewing collisions as entangled trajectories, or tangles, can be used analytically, as a design approach, and as a lens to broach ethical complexity.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

The level of perturbation is determined automatically through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF.

In addition, the imbalanced distribution of driving scenarios often biases models toward data-rich cases, limiting performance in safety-critical, data-scarce conditions. To address these challenges, we propose the Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction (SSTP) framework, which constructs a compact yet balanced dataset for trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages (1) Extraction, in which a pretrained trajectory prediction model computes gradient vectors for each sample to capture their influence on parameter updates; and (2) Selection, where a submodular function is applied to greedily choose a representative subset that covers diverse driving scenarios. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy and even improving in high-density cases. We evaluate our proposed SSTP on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmarks using a wide range of recent state-of-the-art models. Our experiments demonstrate that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Importantly, SSTP exhibits strong generalization and robustness, and the selected subset is model-agnostic, offering a broadly applicable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reachable Sets-based Trajectory Planning Combining Reinforcement Learning and iLQR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17398v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The driving risk field is applicable to more complex driving scenarios, providing new approaches for safety decision-making and active vehicle control in intricate environments. However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse canonical correlation analysis for multiple measurements with latent trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15140v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonical Correlation Analysis, CCA, is a widely used multivariate method in omics research for integrating high dimensional datasets. CCA identifies hidden links by deriving linear projections of features maximally correlating datasets. For standard CCA, observations must be independent of each other. As a result, it cannot properly deal with repeated measurements. Current CCA extensions dealing with these challenges either perform CCA on summarized data or estimate correlations for each measurement. While these techniques factor in the correlation between measurements, they are sub-optimal for high dimensional analysis and exploiting this datas longitudinal qualities. We propose a novel extension of sparse CCA that incorporates time dynamics at the latent level through longitudinal models. This approach addresses the correlation of repeated measurements while drawing latent paths, focusing on dynamics in the correlation structures. To aid interpretability and computational efficiency, we implement a penalty to enforce fixed sparsity levels. We estimate these trajectories fitting longitudinal models to the low dimensional latent variables, leveraging the clustered structure of high dimensional datasets, thus exploring shared longitudinal latent mechanisms. Furthermore, modeling time in the latent space significantly reduces computational burden. We validate our models performance using simulated data and show its real world applicability with data from the Human Microbiome Project. Our CCA method for repeated measurements enables efficient estimation of canonical correlations across measurements for clustered data. Compared to existing methods, ours substantially reduces computational time in high dimensional analyses as well as provides longitudinal trajectories that yield interpretable and insightful results.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

However, existing TUL methods are limited by high model complexity and poor learning of the effective representations of trajectories, rendering them ineffective in handling large-scale user trajectory data. In this work, we propose a novel $\underline{Scal}$abl$\underline{e}$ Trajectory-User Linking with dual-stream representation networks for large-scale $\underline{TUL}$ problem, named ScaleTUL. Specifically, ScaleTUL generates two views using temporal and spatial augmentations to exploit supervised contrastive learning framework to effectively capture the irregularities of trajectories. In each view, a dual-stream trajectory encoder, consisting of a long-term encoder and a short-term encoder, is designed to learn unified trajectory representations that fuse different temporal-spatial dependencies. Then, a TUL layer is used to associate the trajectories with the corresponding users in the representation space using a two-stage training model. Experimental results on check-in mobility datasets from three real-world cities and the nationwide U.S. demonstrate the superiority of ScaleTUL over state-of-the-art baselines for large-scale TUL tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, a widely used negative prompting strategy is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose using a specific formulation of negative prompting instead of the widely used one. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content, including ones proposed by red teams, and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (either image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Other Vehicle Trajectories Are Also Needed: A Driving World Model Unifies Ego-Other Vehicle Trajectories in Video Latent Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09215v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced end-to-end autonomous driving systems predict other vehicles' motions and plan ego vehicle's trajectory. The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

The key challenge arises from depth variation induced spatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local spatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks. In contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation through continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper presents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal trajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively characterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we first introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a continuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to encode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation, we introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal features under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve parameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The final 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of parametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce CarlaEvent3D, a multi-dynamic synthetic dataset for comprehensive validation. Extensive experiments on both this dataset and a real-world benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approach is to enforce the dynamic model as a constraint. However, we show this approach leads to significantly redundant operations, as well as being heavily dependent on the state space representation. Specifically, we propose an intrinsic successive convexification methodology for optimal control on smooth manifolds. This so-called iSCvx is then applied to a representative example involving attitude trajectory optimization for a spacecraft subject to non-convex constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[CDKFormer: Contextual Deviation Knowledge-Based Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12695v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the future movements of surrounding vehicles is essential for ensuring the safe operation and efficient navigation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in urban traffic environments. Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |

However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dataset Distillation by Matching Adversarial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12069v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation synthesizes compact datasets that enable models to achieve performance comparable to training on the original large-scale datasets. However, existing distillation methods overlook the robustness of the model, resulting in models that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when trained on distilled data. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of ``robust dataset distillation", a novel paradigm that embeds adversarial robustness into the synthetic datasets during the distillation process. We propose Matching Adversarial Trajectories (MAT), a method that integrates adversarial training into trajectory-based dataset distillation. MAT incorporates adversarial samples during trajectory generation to obtain robust training trajectories, which are then used to guide the distillation process. As experimentally demonstrated, even through natural training on our distilled dataset, models can achieve enhanced adversarial robustness while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing distillation methods. Our work highlights robust dataset distillation as a new and important research direction and provides a strong baseline for future research to bridge the gap between efficient training and adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While recent Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of required demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect high-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose Sketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch trajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach extends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on imitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks. Sketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D sketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect initial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two ways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine this policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the baseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding the performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from sketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and potentially broadens its applications across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peiho...</summary><p>Peihong Yu and Amisha Bhaskar contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, this does not reflect the complexities of real-world tasks where curvatures can vary arbitrarily, limiting its applications. This study aims to address this gap by introducing the total curvature parameter K into the equation to account for the overall curviness characteristic of a path. To validate this extension, we conducted a mouse-steering experiment on fixed-width paths with varying lengths and curviness levels. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of K significantly improves model fitness for movement time prediction over traditional models. These findings advance our understanding of movement in complex environments and support potential applications in fields like speech motor control and virtual navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of Non-Linear Programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. To address these hurdles, this paper proposes a two-layer optimization algorithm for 2D vehicles by dynamically reformulating small time horizon convex programming subproblems, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets identified by our customized search algorithms incrementally. The key benefits of our proposed algorithm include fast computation speeds and lower task time. We demonstrate these advantages through mathematical proofs under some moderate preconditions and experimental results.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance.

This paper introduces Trajectory Mamba, a novel efficient trajectory prediction framework based on the selective state-space model (SSM). Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of Trajectory Mamba in trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fusion of Indirect Methods and Iterative Learning for Persistent Velocity Trajectory Optimization of a Sustainably Powered Autonomous Surface Vessel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10884v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the methodology and results for a real-time velocity trajectory optimization for a solar-powered autonomous surface vessel (ASV), where we combine indirect optimal control techniques with iterative learning. The ASV exhibits cyclic operation due to the nature of the solar profile, but weather patterns create inevitable disturbances in this profile. The nature of the problem results in a formulation where the satisfaction of pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints does not generally guarantee persistent feasibility, and the goal is to maximize information gathered over a very long (ultimately persistent) time duration. To address these challenges, we first use barrier functions to tighten pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints by the minimal amount necessary to achieve persistent feasibility. We then use indirect methods to derive a simple switching control law, where the optimal velocity is shown to be an undetermined constant value during each constraint-inactive time segment. To identify this optimal constant velocity (which can vary from one segment to the next), we employ an iterative learning approach. The result is a simple closed-form control law that does not require a solar forecast. We present simulation-based validation results, based on a model of the SeaTrac SP-48 ASV and solar data from the North Carolina coast. These simulation results show that the proposed methodology, which amounts to a closed-form controller and simple iterative learning update law, performs nearly as well as a model predictive control approach that requires an accurate future solar forecast and significantly greater computational capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating relapse time distribution from longitudinal biomarker trajectories using iterative regression and continuous time Markov processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10448v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomarker measurements obtained by blood sampling are often used as a non-invasive means of monitoring tumour progression in cancer patients. Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

| **[DA-STGCN: 4D Trajectory Prediction Based on Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04823v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The importance of four-dimensional (4D) trajectory prediction within air traffic management systems is on the rise. Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

| **[Finding the Muses: Identifying Coresets through Loss Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09721v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To address this, we propose Loss Trajectory Correlation (LTC), a novel metric for coreset selection that identifies critical training samples driving generalization. $LTC$ quantifies the alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories, enabling the construction of compact, representative subsets. Unlike traditional methods with computational and storage overheads that are infeasible to scale to large datasets, $LTC$ achieves superior efficiency as it can be computed as a byproduct of training. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that $LTC$ consistently achieves accuracy on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, with any differences remaining under 1%. LTC also effectively transfers across various architectures, including ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer, with minimal performance degradation (<2%). Additionally, LTC offers insights into training dynamics, such as identifying aligned and conflicting sample behaviors, at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. This framework paves the way for scalable coreset selection and efficient dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Fault-Tolerant Control and Agile Trajectory Planning for Modular Aerial Robotic Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09351v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular Aerial Robotic Systems (MARS) consist of multiple drone units that can self-reconfigure to adapt to various mission requirements and fault conditions. However, existing fault-tolerant control methods exhibit significant oscillations during docking and separation, impacting system stability. To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible. Our work represents the first comprehensive approach to enable fault-tolerant and collision avoidance flight for MARS. We validate our method through extensive simulations, demonstrating improved fault tolerance, enhanced trajectory tracking accuracy, and greater robustness in cluttered environments.

| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11261</p></details> |

Both these tasks are crucial for automation and assistance in endoscopy surgery. Given the safety-critical nature of these tasks, reliable uncertainty quantification is essential. Conformal prediction is a fast-growing and widely recognized framework for uncertainty estimation in machine learning and computer vision, offering distribution-free, theoretically valid prediction intervals. In this work, we explore the application of standard conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression to estimate uncertainty in forecasting surgical instrument motion, i.e., predicting direction and magnitude of surgical instruments' future motion. We analyze and compare their coverage and interval sizes, assessing the impact of multiple hypothesis testing and correction methods. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be employed to produce useful uncertainty heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying conformal prediction to surgical guidance, marking an initial step toward constructing principled prediction intervals with formal coverage guarantees in this domain.</p></details> |  |

This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU.

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |

In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2110.13947</p></details> |

In contrast, simple robotic grippers have low dexterity and fail to handle small objects effectively. This is why many automation tasks remain unsolved by robots. This paper presents an optimization-based framework for in-hand manipulation with a robotic hand equipped with compact Magnetic Tactile Sensors (MTSs). The small form factor of the robotic hand from Shadow Robot introduces challenges in estimating the state of the object while satisfying contact constraints. To address this, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for finger movements while ensuring contact points to change along the geometry of the fingers. Using the optimized trajectory from the solver, we implement and test an open-loop controller for rolling motion. To further enhance robustness and accuracy, we introduce a force controller for the fingers and a state estimator for the object utilizing MTSs. The proposed framework is validated through comparative experiments, showing that incorporating the force control with compliance consideration improves the accuracy and robustness of the rolling motion. Rolling an object with the force controller is 30\% more likely to succeed than running an open-loop controller.

Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT.

| **[Efficient Trajectory Generation Based on Traversable Planes in 3D Complex Architectural Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08076v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing integration of robots into human life, their role in architectural spaces where people spend most of their time has become more prominent. While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability. We conduct experiments in simulated environments and test on a CubeTrack robot in real-world scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 2tables.

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

Accurate predictions enable the prevention of collisions, anticipation of crossing intent, and improved overall system efficiency. In this study, we present SGNetPose+, an enhancement of the SGNet architecture designed to integrate skeleton information or body segment angles with bounding boxes to predict pedestrian trajectories from video data to avoid hazards in autonomous driving. Skeleton information was extracted using a pose estimation model, and joint angles were computed based on the extracted joint data. We also apply temporal data augmentation by horizontally flipping video frames to increase the dataset size and improve performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the JAAD and PIE datasets using pose data with the bounding boxes, outperforming the SGNet model.

Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is intrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We prove linear convergence rates and rigorously evaluate our method on cell data characterized by bifurcations, merges, and trajectory splitting scenarios like $supercells$, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods often struggle with content leakage and style misalignment, particularly when using image-driven approaches that aim to transfer precise styles. In this work, we introduce Trajectory Reset Attention Control (TRAC), a novel method that allows for high-quality style transfer while preserving content integrity. TRAC operates by resetting the denoising trajectory and enforcing attention control, thus enhancing content consistency while significantly reducing the computational costs against inversion-based methods. Additionally, a concept termed Style Medium is introduced to bridge the gap between content and style, enabling a more precise and harmonious transfer of stylistic elements. Building upon these concepts, we present a tuning-free framework that offers a stable, flexible, and efficient solution for both image and video style transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework accommodates a wide range of stylized outputs, from precise content preservation to the production of visually striking results with vibrant and expressive styles.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Goal-driven and User-Informed Dynamic Estimation for pedestrian trajectory using Chain-of-Thought (GUIDE-CoT). Our approach integrates two innovative modules: (1) a goal-oriented visual prompt, which enhances goal prediction accuracy combining visual prompts with a pretrained visual encoder, and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) LLM for trajectory generation, which generates realistic trajectories toward the predicted goal. Moreover, our method introduces controllable trajectory generation, allowing for flexible and user-guided modifications to the predicted paths. Through extensive experiments on the ETH/UCY benchmark datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering both high accuracy and greater adaptability in pedestrian trajectory prediction.

However, it remains a challenge to accurately account for agents' intentions and social behaviors when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate the unique randomness within each of those components in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by vibration systems and their resonance properties, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to encode and forecast pedestrian trajectories in the form of ``co-vibrations''. It decomposes trajectory modifications and randomnesses into multiple vibration portions to simulate agents' reactions to each single cause, and forecasts trajectories as the superposition of these independent vibrations separately. Also, benefiting from such vibrations and their spectral properties, representations of social interactions can be learned by emulating the resonance phenomena, further enhancing its explainability. Experiments on multiple datasets have verified its usefulness both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

However, current research often overlooks the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks explainability in trajectory prediction models, limiting their practical use in real-world situations. To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy. Moreover, the factors identified align with the human driving experience, underscoring the model's effectiveness in learning accurate predictions.

Specifically, we use a GMM to model the multimodal behaviors of obstacles' uncertain states. Then, we develop a mixed-integer conic approximation to the chance-constrained trajectory planning problem with deterministic linear systems and polyhedral obstacles. When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments. We verify our methods with state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms and autonomous driving datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Control Systems Letters</p></details> |

Existing methods are designed for specific ball types and struggle to generalize. This challenge arises from three key factors. First, learning-based models require large datasets but suffer from accuracy drops in unseen scenarios. Second, physics-based models rely on complex formulas and detailed inputs, yet accurately obtaining ball states, such as spin, is often impractical. Third, integrating physical principles with neural networks to achieve high accuracy, fast inference, and strong generalization remains difficult. To address these issues, we propose an innovative approach that incorporates physics-based equations and neural networks. We first derive three generalized physical formulas. Then, using a neural network and observed trajectory points, we infer certain parameters while fitting the remaining ones. These formulas enable precise trajectory prediction with minimal training data: only a few dozen samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method superiority in generalization, real-time performance, and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission was made without my advisor's consent, and I mistakenly uploaded an incorrect version of the paper.

Latencies cause misalignments in both spatial and semantic features, complicating the fusion of real-time observations from the ego vehicle with delayed data from others. To address these issues, we propose TraF-Align, a novel framework that learns the flow path of features by predicting the feature-level trajectory of objects from past observations up to the ego vehicle's current time. By generating temporally ordered sampling points along these paths, TraF-Align directs attention from the current-time query to relevant historical features along each trajectory, supporting the reconstruction of current-time features and promoting semantic interaction across multiple frames. This approach corrects spatial misalignment and ensures semantic consistency across agents, effectively compensating for motion and achieving coherent feature fusion. Experiments on two real-world datasets, V2V4Real and DAIR-V2X-Seq, show that TraF-Align sets a new benchmark for asynchronous cooperative perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keep-out constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance.

| **[Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony: Decoupling Exploration and Learning for Fast, Scalable LLM Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18929v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a critical component of large language model (LLM) post-training. However, existing on-policy algorithms used for post-training are inherently incompatible with the use of experience replay buffers, which can be populated scalably by distributed off-policy actors to enhance exploration as compute increases. We propose efficiently obtaining this benefit of replay buffers via Trajectory Balance with Asynchrony (TBA), a massively scalable LLM RL system. In contrast to existing approaches, TBA uses a larger fraction of compute on search, constantly generating off-policy data for a central replay buffer. A training node simultaneously samples data from this buffer based on reward or recency to update the policy using Trajectory Balance (TB), a diversity-seeking RL objective introduced for GFlowNets. TBA offers three key advantages: (1) decoupled training and search, speeding up training wall-clock time by 4x or more; (2) improved diversity through large-scale off-policy sampling; and (3) scalable search for sparse reward settings. On mathematical reasoning, preference-tuning, and automated red-teaming (diverse and representative post-training tasks), TBA produces speed and performance improvements over strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[CarPlanner: Consistent Auto-regressive Trajectory Planning for Large-scale Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19908v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning is vital for autonomous driving, ensuring safe and efficient navigation in complex environments. While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |
| **[Unified Uncertainty-Aware Diffusion for Multi-Agent Trajectory Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18589v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory modeling has primarily focused on forecasting future states, often overlooking broader tasks like trajectory completion, which are crucial for real-world applications such as correcting tracking data. Existing methods also generally predict agents' states without offering any state-wise measure of uncertainty. Moreover, popular multi-modal sampling methods lack any error probability estimates for each generated scene under the same prior observations, making it difficult to rank the predictions during inference time. We introduce U2Diff, a \textbf{unified} diffusion model designed to handle trajectory completion while providing state-wise \textbf{uncertainty} estimates jointly. This uncertainty estimation is achieved by augmenting the simple denoising loss with the negative log-likelihood of the predicted noise and propagating latent space uncertainty to the real state space. Additionally, we incorporate a Rank Neural Network in post-processing to enable \textbf{error probability} estimation for each generated mode, demonstrating a strong correlation with the error relative to ground truth. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions in trajectory completion and forecasting across four challenging sports datasets (NBA, Basketball-U, Football-U, Soccer-U), highlighting the effectiveness of uncertainty and error probability estimation.

| **[DiffMove: Group Mobility Tendency Enhanced Trajectory Recovery via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18302v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the real world, trajectory data is often sparse and incomplete due to low collection frequencies or limited device coverage. Trajectory recovery aims to recover these missing trajectory points, making the trajectories denser and more complete. However, this task faces two key challenges: 1) The excessive sparsity of individual trajectories makes it difficult to effectively leverage historical information for recovery; 2) Sparse trajectories make it harder to capture complex individual mobility preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method called DiffMove. Firstly, we harness crowd wisdom for trajectory recovery. Specifically, we construct a group tendency graph using the collective trajectories of all users and then integrate the group mobility trends into the location representations via graph embedding. This solves the challenge of sparse trajectories being unable to rely on individual historical trajectories for recovery. Secondly, we capture individual mobility preferences from both historical and current perspectives. Finally, we integrate group mobility tendencies and individual preferences into the spatiotemporal distribution of the trajectory to recover high-quality trajectories. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DiffMove outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Further analysis validates the robustness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Imputation in Multi-Agent Sports with Derivative-Accumulating Self-Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10878v3)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory data collected from domains such as team sports often suffer from missing values due to various factors. While many imputation methods have been proposed for spatiotemporal data, they are not well-suited for multi-agent sports scenarios where player movements are highly dynamic and inter-agent interactions continuously evolve. To address these challenges, we propose MIDAS (Multi-agent Imputer with Derivative-Accumulating Self-ensemble), a framework that imputes multi-agent trajectories with high accuracy and physical plausibility. It jointly predicts positions, velocities, and accelerations through a Set Transformer-based neural network and generates alternative estimates by recursively accumulating predicted velocity and acceleration values. These predictions are then combined using a learnable weighted ensemble to produce final imputed trajectories. Experiments on three sports datasets demonstrate that MIDAS significantly outperforms existing baselines in both positional accuracy and physical plausibility. Lastly, we showcase use cases of MIDAS, such as approximating total distance and pass success probability, to highlight its applicability to practical downstream tasks that require complete tracking data.</p></details> |  |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames.

Using data from seven cohorts belonging to the Lifetime Risk Pooling Project (LRPP), we present a Bayesian hierarchical multivariate approach that jointly models multiple longitudinal risk factors over time and across cohorts. Because few cohorts in our project cover the entire adult lifespan, our strategy uses information from all risk factors to increase precision for each risk factor trajectory and borrows information across cohorts to fill in unobserved risk factors. We develop novel diagnostic testing and model validation methods to ensure that our model robustly captures and maintains critical relationships over time and across risk factors.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches either rely on heuristics for instantaneous foothold selection--compromising safety and versatility--or solve expensive trajectory optimization problems with complex terrain features and long time horizons. In contrast, our framework leverages reactive synthesis to generate correct-by-construction controllers at the symbolic level, and mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) for dynamic and physically feasible footstep planning for each symbolic transition. We use a high-level manager to reduce the large state space in synthesis by incorporating local environment information, improving synthesis scalability. To handle specifications that cannot be met due to dynamic infeasibility, and to minimize costly MICP solves, we leverage a symbolic repair process to generate only necessary symbolic transitions. During online execution, re-running the MICP with real-world terrain data, along with runtime symbolic repair, bridges the gap between offline synthesis and online execution. We demonstrate, in simulation, our framework's capabilities to discover missing locomotion skills and react promptly in safety-critical environments, such as scattered stepping stones and rebars.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiNash-PF: A Particle Filtering Approach for Computing Multiple Local Generalized Nash Equilibria in Trajectory Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05554v2)** | 2025-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern robotic systems frequently engage in complex multi-agent interactions, many of which are inherently multi-modal, meaning they can lead to multiple distinct outcomes. To interact effectively, robots must recognize the possible interaction modes and adapt to the one preferred by other agents. In this work, we propose an efficient algorithm for capturing the multimodality in multi-agent interactions. We leverage a game-theoretic planner to model interaction outcomes as equilibria where \emph{each equilibrium} corresponds to a distinct interaction \emph{mode}. We then develop an efficient algorithm to identify all the equilibria, allowing robots to reason about multiple interaction modes. More specifically, we formulate interactive planning as Constrained Potential Trajectory Games (CPTGs) and model interaction outcomes by local Generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) of the game. CPTGs are a class of games for which a local GNE can be found by solving a single constrained optimal control problem where a potential function is minimized. We propose to integrate the potential game approach with implicit particle filtering, a sample-efficient method for non-convex trajectory optimization. We utilize implicit particle filtering to identify the coarse estimates of multiple local minimizers of the game's potential function. MultiNash-PF then refines these estimates with optimization solvers, obtaining different local GNEs. We show through numerical simulations that MultiNash-PF reduces computation time by up to 50\% compared to a baseline. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, where it successfully accounts for the multi-modal nature of interactions and resolves potential conflicts in real-time.</p></details> |  |

However, previous Human Trajectory Prediction (HTP) methods leverage the pose cues implicitly, resulting in implausible predictions. To address this, we propose Locomotion Embodiment, a framework that explicitly evaluates the physical plausibility of the predicted trajectory by locomotion generation under the laws of physics. While the plausibility of locomotion is learned with an indifferentiable physics simulator, it is replaced by our differentiable Locomotion Value function to train an HTP network in a data-driven manner. In particular, our proposed Embodied Locomotion loss is beneficial for efficiently training a stochastic HTP network using multiple heads. Furthermore, the Locomotion Value filter is proposed to filter out implausible trajectories at inference. Experiments demonstrate that our method enhances even the state-of-the-art HTP methods across diverse datasets and problem settings.

The proposed system employs multiple UAVs equipped with dual-functional radar-communication capabilities to simultaneously perform target sensing and provide communication services to users. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to maximize the sum rate of users while maintaining target sensing performance through coordinated beamforming and UAV trajectory design. To address this challenging non-convex problem, we develop a block coordinated descent (BCD)-based iterative algorithm that decomposes the original problem into tractable subproblems. Then, the beamforming design problem is addressed using fractional programming, while the UAV trajectory is refined through the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint optimization approach achieves significant performance improvements in both communication throughput and sensing accuracy compared to conventional, separated designs. We also show that proper coordination of multiple UAVs through optimized trajectories and beamforming patterns can effectively balance the tradeoff between sensing and communication objectives.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |

However, the role of data sampling techniques in offline RL has been overlooked despite its potential to enhance online RL performance. Recent research suggests applying sampling techniques directly to state-transitions does not consistently improve performance in offline RL. Therefore, in this study, we propose a memory technique, (Prioritized) Trajectory Replay (TR/PTR), which extends the sampling perspective to trajectories for more comprehensive information extraction from limited data. TR enhances learning efficiency by backward sampling of trajectories that optimizes the use of subsequent state information. Building on TR, we build the weighted critic target to avoid sampling unseen actions in offline training, and Prioritized Trajectory Replay (PTR) that enables more efficient trajectory sampling, prioritized by various trajectory priority metrics.

| **[Parameter Adjustments in POMDP-Based Trajectory Planning for Unsignalized Intersections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06405v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the problem of trajectory planning for autonomous vehicles at unsignalized intersections, specifically focusing on scenarios where the vehicle lacks the right of way and yet must cross safely. To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> | Submitted version |
| **[MagicMotion: Controllable Video Generation with Dense-to-Sparse Trajectory Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16421v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation have led to remarkable improvements in visual quality and temporal coherence. Upon this, trajectory-controllable video generation has emerged to enable precise object motion control through explicitly defined spatial paths. However, existing methods struggle with complex object movements and multi-object motion control, resulting in imprecise trajectory adherence, poor object consistency, and compromised visual quality. Furthermore, these methods only support trajectory control in a single format, limiting their applicability in diverse scenarios. Additionally, there is no publicly available dataset or benchmark specifically tailored for trajectory-controllable video generation, hindering robust training and systematic evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce MagicMotion, a novel image-to-video generation framework that enables trajectory control through three levels of conditions from dense to sparse: masks, bounding boxes, and sparse boxes. Given an input image and trajectories, MagicMotion seamlessly animates objects along defined trajectories while maintaining object consistency and visual quality. Furthermore, we present MagicData, a large-scale trajectory-controlled video dataset, along with an automated pipeline for annotation and filtering. We also introduce MagicBench, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses both video quality and trajectory control accuracy across different numbers of objects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MagicMotion outperforms previous methods across various metrics.

| **[Loop Closure from Two Views: Revisiting PGO for Scalable Trajectory Estimation through Monocular Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16275v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>(Visual) Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) remains a fundamental challenge in enabling autonomous systems to navigate and understand large-scale environments. Traditional SLAM approaches struggle to balance efficiency and accuracy, particularly in large-scale settings where extensive computational resources are required for scene reconstruction and Bundle Adjustment (BA). However, this scene reconstruction, in the form of sparse pointclouds of visual landmarks, is often only used within the SLAM system because navigation and planning methods require different map representations. In this work, we therefore investigate a more scalable Visual SLAM (VSLAM) approach without reconstruction, mainly based on approaches for two-view loop closures. By restricting the map to a sparse keyframed pose graph without dense geometry representations, our '2GO' system achieves efficient optimization with competitive absolute trajectory accuracy. In particular, we find that recent advancements in image matching and monocular depth priors enable very accurate trajectory optimization from two-view edges. We conduct extensive experiments on diverse datasets, including large-scale scenarios, and provide a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between runtime, accuracy, and map size. Our results demonstrate that this streamlined approach supports real-time performance, scales well in map size and trajectory duration, and effectively broadens the capabilities of VSLAM for long-duration deployments to large environments.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models still face challenges in generating object motions with potentially changing 6D poses under wide-range rotations, due to limited 3D understanding. To address this problem, we introduce PoseTraj, a pose-aware video dragging model for generating 3D-aligned motion from 2D trajectories. Our method adopts a novel two-stage pose-aware pretraining framework, improving 3D understanding across diverse trajectories. Specifically, we propose a large-scale synthetic dataset PoseTraj-10K, containing 10k videos of objects following rotational trajectories, and enhance the model perception of object pose changes by incorporating 3D bounding boxes as intermediate supervision signals. Following this, we fine-tune the trajectory-controlling module on real-world videos, applying an additional camera-disentanglement module to further refine motion accuracy. Experiments on various benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method not only excels in 3D pose-aligned dragging for rotational trajectories but also outperforms existing baselines in trajectory accuracy and video quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code,...</summary><p>Code, data and project page: https://robingg1.github.io/Pose-Traj/</p></details> |

Without loosing any information, we associate to each state a binary random function, taking values in $\{0,1\}$, and turn the problem of statistical modeling of a categorical process into a multivariate functional data analysis issue. The (multivariate) covariance operator has nice interpretations in terms of departure from independence of the joint probabilities and the multivariate functional principal components are simple to interpret. Under the weak hypothesis assuming only continuity in probability of the $0-1$ trajectories, it is simple to build consistent estimators of the covariance kernel and perform multivariate functional principal components analysis. The sample paths being piecewise constant, with a finite number of jumps, this a rare case in functional data analysis in which the trajectories are not supposed to be continuous and can be observed exhaustively. The approach is illustrated on a data set of sensory perceptions, considering different gustometer-controlled stimuli experiments. We also show how it can be easily extended to analyze experiments, such as temporal check-all-that-apply, in which two states or more can be observed at the same time.</p></details> |  |

We report on a soma design workshop that explored how our bodies could collide with telepresence robots, mobility aids, and a quadruped robot. Based on our findings, we employed soma trajectories to analyse collisions as extended experiences that negotiate key transitions of consent, preparation, launch, contact, ripple, sting, untangle, debris and reflect. We then employed these ideas to analyse two collision experiences, an accidental collision between a person and a drone, and the deliberate design of a robot to play with cats, revealing how real-world collisions involve the complex and ongoing entanglement of soma trajectories. We discuss how viewing collisions as entangled trajectories, or tangles, can be used analytically, as a design approach, and as a lens to broach ethical complexity.</p></details> | 32 pages, 13 figures |

Although existing 3D editing methods excel at modifying color, texture, and style, they struggle with extensive geometric or appearance changes, thus limiting their applications. To this end, we propose Perturb-and-Revise, which makes possible a variety of NeRF editing. First, we perturb the NeRF parameters with random initializations to create a versatile initialization. The level of perturbation is determined automatically through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Perturb-and-Revise facilitates flexible, effective, and consistent editing of color, appearance, and geometry in 3D.

| **[SSTP: Efficient Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17385v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a core task in autonomous driving. However, training advanced trajectory prediction models on large-scale datasets is both time-consuming and computationally expensive. In addition, the imbalanced distribution of driving scenarios often biases models toward data-rich cases, limiting performance in safety-critical, data-scarce conditions. To address these challenges, we propose the Sample Selection for Trajectory Prediction (SSTP) framework, which constructs a compact yet balanced dataset for trajectory prediction. SSTP consists of two main stages (1) Extraction, in which a pretrained trajectory prediction model computes gradient vectors for each sample to capture their influence on parameter updates; and (2) Selection, where a submodular function is applied to greedily choose a representative subset that covers diverse driving scenarios. This approach significantly reduces the dataset size and mitigates scenario imbalance, without sacrificing prediction accuracy and even improving in high-density cases. We evaluate our proposed SSTP on the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 benchmarks using a wide range of recent state-of-the-art models. Our experiments demonstrate that SSTP achieves comparable performance to full-dataset training using only half the data while delivering substantial improvements in high-density traffic scenes and significantly reducing training time. Importantly, SSTP exhibits strong generalization and robustness, and the selected subset is model-agnostic, offering a broadly applicable solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reachable Sets-based Trajectory Planning Combining Reinforcement Learning and iLQR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17398v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The driving risk field is applicable to more complex driving scenarios, providing new approaches for safety decision-making and active vehicle control in intricate environments. However, existing research often overlooks the driving risk field and fails to consider the impact of risk distribution within drivable areas on trajectory planning, which poses challenges for enhancing safety. This paper proposes a trajectory planning method for intelligent vehicles based on the risk reachable set to further improve the safety of trajectory planning. First, we construct the reachable set incorporating the driving risk field to more accurately assess and avoid potential risks in drivable areas. Then, the initial trajectory is generated based on safe reinforcement learning and projected onto the reachable set. Finally, we introduce a trajectory planning method based on a constrained iterative quadratic regulator to optimize the initial solution, ensuring that the planned trajectory achieves optimal comfort, safety, and efficiency. We conduct simulation tests of trajectory planning in high-speed lane-changing scenarios. The results indicate that the proposed method can guarantee trajectory comfort and driving efficiency, with the generated trajectory situated outside high-risk boundaries, thereby ensuring vehicle safety during operation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse canonical correlation analysis for multiple measurements with latent trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15140v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Canonical Correlation Analysis, CCA, is a widely used multivariate method in omics research for integrating high dimensional datasets. CCA identifies hidden links by deriving linear projections of features maximally correlating datasets. For standard CCA, observations must be independent of each other. As a result, it cannot properly deal with repeated measurements. Current CCA extensions dealing with these challenges either perform CCA on summarized data or estimate correlations for each measurement. While these techniques factor in the correlation between measurements, they are sub-optimal for high dimensional analysis and exploiting this datas longitudinal qualities. We propose a novel extension of sparse CCA that incorporates time dynamics at the latent level through longitudinal models. This approach addresses the correlation of repeated measurements while drawing latent paths, focusing on dynamics in the correlation structures. To aid interpretability and computational efficiency, we implement a penalty to enforce fixed sparsity levels. We estimate these trajectories fitting longitudinal models to the low dimensional latent variables, leveraging the clustered structure of high dimensional datasets, thus exploring shared longitudinal latent mechanisms. Furthermore, modeling time in the latent space significantly reduces computational burden. We validate our models performance using simulated data and show its real world applicability with data from the Human Microbiome Project. Our CCA method for repeated measurements enables efficient estimation of canonical correlations across measurements for clustered data. Compared to existing methods, ours substantially reduces computational time in high dimensional analyses as well as provides longitudinal trajectories that yield interpretable and insightful results.</p></details> | 19 pages, 13 figures |

However, existing TUL methods are limited by high model complexity and poor learning of the effective representations of trajectories, rendering them ineffective in handling large-scale user trajectory data. In this work, we propose a novel $\underline{Scal}$abl$\underline{e}$ Trajectory-User Linking with dual-stream representation networks for large-scale $\underline{TUL}$ problem, named ScaleTUL. Specifically, ScaleTUL generates two views using temporal and spatial augmentations to exploit supervised contrastive learning framework to effectively capture the irregularities of trajectories. In each view, a dual-stream trajectory encoder, consisting of a long-term encoder and a short-term encoder, is designed to learn unified trajectory representations that fuse different temporal-spatial dependencies. Then, a TUL layer is used to associate the trajectories with the corresponding users in the representation space using a two-stage training model. Experimental results on check-in mobility datasets from three real-world cities and the nationwide U.S. demonstrate the superiority of ScaleTUL over state-of-the-art baselines for large-scale TUL tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Recent advances in constrained trajectory prediction focus on structured constraints by constructing optimization objectives. However, handling unstructured constraints is challenging due to the lack of differentiable formal definitions. To address this, we propose a novel method for constrained trajectory prediction using a conditional generative paradigm, named Controllable Trajectory Diffusion (CTD). The key idea is that any trajectory corresponds to a degree of conformity to a constraint. By quantifying this degree and treating it as a condition, a model can implicitly learn to predict trajectories under unstructured constraints. CTD employs a pre-trained scoring model to predict the degree of conformity (i.e., a score), and uses this score as a condition for a conditional diffusion model to generate trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that CTD achieves high accuracy on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks. Qualitative analysis confirms that CTD ensures adherence to unstructured constraints and can predict trajectories that satisfy combinatorial constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>has b...</summary><p>has been accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, a widely used negative prompting strategy is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose using a specific formulation of negative prompting instead of the widely used one. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content, including ones proposed by red teams, and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (either image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |

However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A representational framework for learning and encoding structurally enriched trajectories in complex agent environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13194v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of artificial intelligence agents to make optimal decisions and generalise them to different domains and tasks is compromised in complex scenarios. One way to address this issue has focused on learning efficient representations of the world and on how the actions of agents affect them, such as disentangled representations that exploit symmetries. Whereas such representations are procedurally efficient, they are based on the compression of low-level state-action transitions, which lack structural richness. To address this problem, we propose to enrich the agent's ontology and extend the traditional conceptualisation of trajectories to provide a more nuanced view of task execution. Structurally Enriched Trajectories (SETs) extend the encoding of sequences of states and their transitions by incorporating hierarchical relations between objects, interactions and affordances. SETs are built as multi-level graphs, providing a detailed representation of the agent dynamics and a transferable functional abstraction of the task. SETs are integrated into an architecture, Structurally Enriched Trajectory Learning and Encoding (SETLE), that employs a heterogeneous graph-based memory structure of multi-level relational dependencies essential for generalisation. Using reinforcement learning as a data generation tool, we demonstrate that SETLE can support downstream tasks, enabling agents to recognise task-relevant structural patterns across diverse environments.</p></details> |  |

Our approach integrates several novel contributions, including a tailored object detector optimized for high-altitude bird's-eye view perspectives, a unique track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, and an orthophoto and master frame-based georeferencing strategy that enhances consistent alignment across multiple drone viewpoints. Additionally, our framework features robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation, enabling comprehensive traffic analysis. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study utilized a multi-drone experiment covering 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising approximately 700,000 unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated images with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons with high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our extraction pipeline in dense urban environments. The public release of Songdo Traffic and Songdo Vision, and the complete source code for the extraction pipeline, establishes new benchmarks in data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise and cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for developing intelligent transportation systems and enhancing traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |

The world model that can foresee the outcome of the trajectory has been used to evaluate the end-to-end autonomous driving system. However, existing world models predominantly emphasize the trajectory of the ego vehicle and leave other vehicles uncontrollable. This limitation hinders their ability to realistically simulate the interaction between the ego vehicle and the driving scenario. In addition, it remains a challenge to match multiple trajectories with each vehicle in the video to control the video generation. To address above issues, a driving World Model named EOT-WM is proposed in this paper, unifying Ego-Other vehicle Trajectories in videos. Specifically, we first project ego and other vehicle trajectories in the BEV space into the image coordinate to match each trajectory with its corresponding vehicle in the video. Then, trajectory videos are encoded by the Spatial-Temporal Variational Auto Encoder to align with driving video latents spatially and temporally in the unified visual space. A trajectory-injected diffusion Transformer is further designed to denoise the noisy video latents for video generation with the guidance of ego-other vehicle trajectories. In addition, we propose a metric based on control latent similarity to evaluate the controllability of trajectories. Extensive experiments are conducted on the nuScenes dataset, and the proposed model outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 30% in FID and 55% in FVD. The model can also predict unseen driving scenes with self-produced trajectories.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

The key challenge arises from depth variation induced spatio-temporal motion inconsistencies, disrupting the assumptions of local spatial or temporal motion smoothness in previous motion estimation frameworks. In contrast, event cameras offer new possibilities for 3D motion estimation through continuous adaptive pixel-level responses to scene changes. This paper presents EMoTive, a novel event-based framework that models spatio-temporal trajectories via event-guided non-uniform parametric curves, effectively characterizing locally heterogeneous spatio-temporal motion. Specifically, we first introduce Event Kymograph - an event projection method that leverages a continuous temporal projection kernel and decouples spatial observations to encode fine-grained temporal evolution explicitly. For motion representation, we introduce a density-aware adaptation mechanism to fuse spatial and temporal features under event guidance, coupled with a non-uniform rational curve parameterization framework to adaptively model heterogeneous trajectories. The final 3D motion estimation is achieved through multi-temporal sampling of parametric trajectories, yielding optical flow and depth motion fields. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce CarlaEvent3D, a multi-dynamic synthetic dataset for comprehensive validation. Extensive experiments on both this dataset and a real-world benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Existing vehicle trajectory prediction methods primarily focus on improving overall performance, yet they struggle to address long-tail scenarios effectively. This limitation often leads to poor predictions in rare cases, significantly increasing the risk of safety incidents. Taking Argoverse 2 motion forecasting dataset as an example, we first investigate the long-tail characteristics in trajectory samples from two perspectives, individual motion and group interaction, and deriving deviation features to distinguish abnormal from regular scenarios. On this basis, we propose CDKFormer, a Contextual Deviation Knowledge-based Transformer model for long-tail trajectory prediction. CDKFormer integrates an attention-based scene context fusion module to encode spatiotemporal interaction and road topology. An additional deviation feature fusion module is proposed to capture the dynamic deviations in the target vehicle status. We further introduce a dual query-based decoder, supported by a multi-stream decoder block, to sequentially decode heterogeneous scene deviation features and generate multimodal trajectory predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CDKFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy and robustness for long-tailed trajectories compared to existing methods, thus advancing the reliability of AVs in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Power Swing Trajectory Influenced by Virtual Impedance-Based Current-Limiting Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12278v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) can emulate the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through appropriate control loop design. However, in systems with GFM IBRs, the apparent impedance trajectory under current limitation differs significantly from that of SG-based systems due to the limited overcurrent capability of power electronic devices. This difference challenges the power swing detection functions of distance relays designed for SG-based systems. This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the apparent impedance trajectory over a full power swing cycle under two typical current-limiting strategies: variable virtual impedance (VI) and adaptive VI. The analysis reveals that the trajectory under VI current-limiting strategies differs significantly from that of a conventional SG. The results also indicate that the control parameters affect the characteristics of the trajectory. In addition, the new trajectories challenge conventional power swing detection functions, increasing the risk of malfunction. Furthermore, the implementation of VI leads to a deterioration in system stability. The theoretical analysis is further validated through simulations on the MATLAB/Simulink platform.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is that high-quality trajectories can be discovered merely by denoising noisy trajectories sampled from a distribution. This approach has no learning component, relying instead on only two ingredients: a dynamical model of the robots to obtain feasible trajectories via rollout, and a score function to guide denoising with Monte Carlo gradient approximation. The proposed framework iteratively optimizes the deformation from the previous round with this denoising process, allows \textit{anytime} refinement as time permits, supports different dynamics, and benefits from GPU acceleration. Our evaluations for differential-drive and holonomic teams with up to 16 robots in 2D and 3D worlds show its ability to discover high-quality solutions faster than other black-box optimization methods such as MPPI, approximately three times faster in a 3D holonomic case with 16 robots. As evidence for feasibility, we demonstrate zero-shot deployment of the planned trajectories on eight multirotors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dataset Distillation by Matching Adversarial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12069v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation synthesizes compact datasets that enable models to achieve performance comparable to training on the original large-scale datasets. However, existing distillation methods overlook the robustness of the model, resulting in models that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks when trained on distilled data. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of ``robust dataset distillation", a novel paradigm that embeds adversarial robustness into the synthetic datasets during the distillation process. We propose Matching Adversarial Trajectories (MAT), a method that integrates adversarial training into trajectory-based dataset distillation. MAT incorporates adversarial samples during trajectory generation to obtain robust training trajectories, which are then used to guide the distillation process. As experimentally demonstrated, even through natural training on our distilled dataset, models can achieve enhanced adversarial robustness while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to existing distillation methods. Our work highlights robust dataset distillation as a new and important research direction and provides a strong baseline for future research to bridge the gap between efficient training and adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning a Fast Mixing Exogenous Block MDP using a Single Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03016v2)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to train agents that can quickly adapt to new objectives or reward functions, efficient unsupervised representation learning in sequential decision-making environments can be important. Frameworks such as the Exogenous Block Markov Decision Process (Ex-BMDP) have been proposed to formalize this representation-learning problem (Efroni et al., 2022b). In the Ex-BMDP framework, the agent's high-dimensional observations of the environment have two latent factors: a controllable factor, which evolves deterministically within a small state space according to the agent's actions, and an exogenous factor, which represents time-correlated noise, and can be highly complex. The goal of the representation learning problem is to learn an encoder that maps from observations into the controllable latent space, as well as the dynamics of this space. Efroni et al. (2022b) has shown that this is possible with a sample complexity that depends only on the size of the controllable latent space, and not on the size of the noise factor. However, this prior work has focused on the episodic setting, where the controllable latent state resets to a specific start state after a finite horizon. By contrast, if the agent can only interact with the environment in a single continuous trajectory, prior works have not established sample-complexity bounds. We propose STEEL, the first provably sample-efficient algorithm for learning the controllable dynamics of an Ex-BMDP from a single trajectory, in the function approximation setting. STEEL has a sample complexity that depends only on the sizes of the controllable latent space and the encoder function class, and (at worst linearly) on the mixing time of the exogenous noise factor. We prove that STEEL is correct and sample-efficient, and demonstrate STEEL on two toy problems. Code is available at: https://github.com/midi-lab/steel.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

While recent Imitation Learning (IL) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods have reduced the number of required demonstrations, they still rely on expert knowledge to collect high-quality data, limiting scalability and accessibility. We propose Sketch-to-Skill, a novel framework that leverages human-drawn 2D sketch trajectories to bootstrap and guide RL for robotic manipulation. Our approach extends beyond previous sketch-based methods, which were primarily focused on imitation learning or policy conditioning, limited to specific trained tasks. Sketch-to-Skill employs a Sketch-to-3D Trajectory Generator that translates 2D sketches into 3D trajectories, which are then used to autonomously collect initial demonstrations. We utilize these sketch-generated demonstrations in two ways: to pre-train an initial policy through behavior cloning and to refine this policy through RL with guided exploration. Experimental results demonstrate that Sketch-to-Skill achieves ~96% of the performance of the baseline model that leverages teleoperated demonstration data, while exceeding the performance of a pure reinforcement learning policy by ~170%, only from sketch inputs. This makes robotic manipulation learning more accessible and potentially broadens its applications across various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Peiho...</summary><p>Peihong Yu and Amisha Bhaskar contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

However, this does not reflect the complexities of real-world tasks where curvatures can vary arbitrarily, limiting its applications. This study aims to address this gap by introducing the total curvature parameter K into the equation to account for the overall curviness characteristic of a path. To validate this extension, we conducted a mouse-steering experiment on fixed-width paths with varying lengths and curviness levels. Our results demonstrate that the introduction of K significantly improves model fitness for movement time prediction over traditional models. These findings advance our understanding of movement in complex environments and support potential applications in fields like speech motor control and virtual navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, optimization-based real-time motion planning becomes increasingly challenging due to the problem's probable non-convexity and the inherent limitations of Non-Linear Programming algorithms. Highly nonlinear dynamics, obstacle avoidance constraints, and non-convex inputs can exacerbate these difficulties. To address these hurdles, this paper proposes a two-layer optimization algorithm for 2D vehicles by dynamically reformulating small time horizon convex programming subproblems, aiming to provide real-time guarantees for trajectory optimization. Our approach involves breaking down the original problem into small horizon-based planning cycles with fixed final times, referred to as planning cycles. Each planning cycle is then solved within a series of restricted convex sets identified by our customized search algorithms incrementally. The key benefits of our proposed algorithm include fast computation speeds and lower task time. We demonstrate these advantages through mathematical proofs under some moderate preconditions and experimental results.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor (TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser (MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D motion compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tora excels in achieving high motion fidelity compared to the foundational DiT model, while also accurately simulating the complex movements of the physical world.

This paper introduces Trajectory Mamba, a novel efficient trajectory prediction framework based on the selective state-space model (SSM). Conventional attention-based models face the challenge of computational costs that grow quadratically with the number of targets, hindering their application in highly dynamic environments. In response, we leverage the SSM to redesign the self-attention mechanism in the encoder-decoder architecture, thereby achieving linear time complexity. To address the potential reduction in prediction accuracy resulting from modifications to the attention mechanism, we propose a joint polyline encoding strategy to better capture the associations between static and dynamic contexts, ultimately enhancing prediction accuracy. Additionally, to balance prediction accuracy and inference speed, we adopted the decoder that differs entirely from the encoder. Through cross-state space attention, all target agents share the scene context, allowing the SSM to interact with the shared scene representation during decoding, thus inferring different trajectories over the next prediction steps. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of inference speed and parameter efficiency on both the Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets. It demonstrates a four-fold reduction in FLOPs compared to existing methods and reduces parameter count by over 40% while surpassing the performance of the vast majority of previous methods. These findings validate the effectiveness of Trajectory Mamba in trajectory prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Fusion of Indirect Methods and Iterative Learning for Persistent Velocity Trajectory Optimization of a Sustainably Powered Autonomous Surface Vessel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10884v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present the methodology and results for a real-time velocity trajectory optimization for a solar-powered autonomous surface vessel (ASV), where we combine indirect optimal control techniques with iterative learning. The ASV exhibits cyclic operation due to the nature of the solar profile, but weather patterns create inevitable disturbances in this profile. The nature of the problem results in a formulation where the satisfaction of pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints does not generally guarantee persistent feasibility, and the goal is to maximize information gathered over a very long (ultimately persistent) time duration. To address these challenges, we first use barrier functions to tighten pointwise-in-time state of charge constraints by the minimal amount necessary to achieve persistent feasibility. We then use indirect methods to derive a simple switching control law, where the optimal velocity is shown to be an undetermined constant value during each constraint-inactive time segment. To identify this optimal constant velocity (which can vary from one segment to the next), we employ an iterative learning approach. The result is a simple closed-form control law that does not require a solar forecast. We present simulation-based validation results, based on a model of the SeaTrac SP-48 ASV and solar data from the North Carolina coast. These simulation results show that the proposed methodology, which amounts to a closed-form controller and simple iterative learning update law, performs nearly as well as a model predictive control approach that requires an accurate future solar forecast and significantly greater computational capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating relapse time distribution from longitudinal biomarker trajectories using iterative regression and continuous time Markov processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10448v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomarker measurements obtained by blood sampling are often used as a non-invasive means of monitoring tumour progression in cancer patients. Diseases evolve dynamically over time, and studying longitudinal observations of specific biomarkers can help to understand patients response to treatment and predict disease progression. We propose a novel iterative regression-based method to estimate changes in patients status within a cohort that includes censored patients, and illustrate it on clinical data from myeloma cases. We formulate the relapse time estimation problem in the framework of Piecewise Deterministic Markov processes (PDMP), where the Euclidean component is a surrogate biomarker for patient state. This approach enables continuous-time estimation of the status-change dates, which in turn allows for accurate inference of the relapse time distribution. A key challenge lies in the partial observability of the process, a complexity that has been rarely addressed in previous studies. . We evaluate the performance of our procedure through a simulation study and compare it with different approaches. This work is a proof of concept on biomarker trajectories with simple behaviour, but our method can easily be extended to more complex dynamics.</p></details> |  |

While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of human driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving preferences. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves PDMS of 93.95 on NavSim benchmark, significantly exceeding other methods. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

| **[GoalFlow: Goal-Driven Flow Matching for Multimodal Trajectories Generation in End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05689v3)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose GoalFlow, an end-to-end autonomous driving method for generating high-quality multimodal trajectories. In autonomous driving scenarios, there is rarely a single suitable trajectory. Recent methods have increasingly focused on modeling multimodal trajectory distributions. However, they suffer from trajectory selection complexity and reduced trajectory quality due to high trajectory divergence and inconsistencies between guidance and scene information. To address these issues, we introduce GoalFlow, a novel method that effectively constrains the generative process to produce high-quality, multimodal trajectories. To resolve the trajectory divergence problem inherent in diffusion-based methods, GoalFlow constrains the generated trajectories by introducing a goal point. GoalFlow establishes a novel scoring mechanism that selects the most appropriate goal point from the candidate points based on scene information. Furthermore, GoalFlow employs an efficient generative method, Flow Matching, to generate multimodal trajectories, and incorporates a refined scoring mechanism to select the optimal trajectory from the candidates. Our experimental results, validated on the Navsim\cite{Dauner2024_navsim}, demonstrate that GoalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering robust multimodal trajectories for autonomous driving. GoalFlow achieved PDMS of 90.3, significantly surpassing other methods. Compared with other diffusion-policy-based methods, our approach requires only a single denoising step to obtain excellent performance.

Key operations such as conflict detection and resolution, aircraft anomaly monitoring, and the management of congested flight paths are increasingly reliant on this foundational technology, underscoring the urgent demand for intelligent solutions. The dynamics in airport terminal zones and crowded airspaces are intricate and ever-changing; however, current methodologies do not sufficiently account for the interactions among aircraft. To tackle these challenges, we propose DA-STGCN, an innovative spatiotemporal graph convolutional network that integrates a dual attention mechanism. Our model reconstructs the adjacency matrix through a self-attention approach, enhancing the capture of node correlations, and employs graph attention to distill spatiotemporal characteristics, thereby generating a probabilistic distribution of predicted trajectories. This novel adjacency matrix, reconstructed with the self-attention mechanism, is dynamically optimized throughout the network's training process, offering a more nuanced reflection of the inter-node relationships compared to traditional algorithms. The performance of the model is validated on two ADS-B datasets, one near the airport terminal area and the other in dense airspace. Experimental results demonstrate a notable improvement over current 4D trajectory prediction methods, achieving a 20% and 30% reduction in the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), respectively. The incorporation of a Dual-Attention module has been shown to significantly enhance the extraction of node correlations, as verified by ablation experiments.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel motion prediction conditional flow matching model, termed MoFlow, to predict K-shot future trajectories for all agents in a given scene. We design a novel flow matching loss function that not only ensures at least one of the $K$ sets of future trajectories is accurate but also encourages all $K$ sets of future trajectories to be diverse and plausible. Furthermore, by leveraging the implicit maximum likelihood estimation (IMLE), we propose a novel distillation method for flow models that only requires samples from the teacher model. Extensive experiments on the real-world datasets, including SportVU NBA games, ETH-UCY, and SDD, demonstrate that both our teacher flow model and the IMLE-distilled student model achieve state-of-the-art performance. These models can generate diverse trajectories that are physically and socially plausible. Moreover, our one-step student model is $\textbf{100}$ times faster than the teacher flow model during sampling.

To address this, we propose Loss Trajectory Correlation (LTC), a novel metric for coreset selection that identifies critical training samples driving generalization. $LTC$ quantifies the alignment between training sample loss trajectories and validation set loss trajectories, enabling the construction of compact, representative subsets. Unlike traditional methods with computational and storage overheads that are infeasible to scale to large datasets, $LTC$ achieves superior efficiency as it can be computed as a byproduct of training. Our results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k show that $LTC$ consistently achieves accuracy on par with or surpassing state-of-the-art coreset selection methods, with any differences remaining under 1%. LTC also effectively transfers across various architectures, including ResNet, VGG, DenseNet, and Swin Transformer, with minimal performance degradation (<2%). Additionally, LTC offers insights into training dynamics, such as identifying aligned and conflicting sample behaviors, at a fraction of the computational cost of traditional methods. This framework paves the way for scalable coreset selection and efficient dataset optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-interactive Multimodal Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09366v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interactions among agents for trajectory prediction of autonomous driving has been challenging due to the inherent uncertainty in agents' behavior. The interactions involved in the predicted trajectories of agents, also called post-interactions, have rarely been considered in trajectory prediction models. To this end, we propose a coarse-to-fine Transformer for multimodal trajectory prediction, i.e., Pioformer, which explicitly extracts the post-interaction features to enhance the prediction accuracy. Specifically, we first build a Coarse Trajectory Network to generate coarse trajectories based on the observed trajectories and lane segments, in which the low-order interaction features are extracted with the graph neural networks. Next, we build a hypergraph neural network-based Trajectory Proposal Network to generate trajectory proposals, where the high-order interaction features are learned by the hypergraphs. Finally, the trajectory proposals are sent to the Proposal Refinement Network for further refinement. The observed trajectories and trajectory proposals are concatenated together as the inputs of the Proposal Refinement Network, in which the post-interaction features are learned by combining the previous interaction features and trajectory consistency features. Moreover, we propose a three-stage training scheme to facilitate the learning process. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 1 dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method. Compared with the baseline HiVT-64, our model has reduced the prediction errors by 4.4%, 8.4%, 14.4%, 5.7% regarding metrics minADE6, minFDE6, MR6, and brier-minFDE6, respectively.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose a novel fault-tolerant control reallocation method that adapts to arbitrary number of modular robots and their assembly formations. The algorithm redistributes the expected collective force and torque required for MARS to individual unit according to their moment arm relative to the center of MARS mass. Furthermore, We propose an agile trajectory planning method for MARS of arbitrary configurations, which is collision-avoiding and dynamically feasible.

| **[Learning Few-Step Diffusion Models by Trajectory Distribution Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06674v2)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating diffusion model sampling is crucial for efficient AIGC deployment. While diffusion distillation methods -- based on distribution matching and trajectory matching -- reduce sampling to as few as one step, they fall short on complex tasks like text-to-image generation. Few-step generation offers a better balance between speed and quality, but existing approaches face a persistent trade-off: distribution matching lacks flexibility for multi-step sampling, while trajectory matching often yields suboptimal image quality. To bridge this gap, we propose learning few-step diffusion models by Trajectory Distribution Matching (TDM), a unified distillation paradigm that combines the strengths of distribution and trajectory matching. Our method introduces a data-free score distillation objective, aligning the student's trajectory with the teacher's at the distribution level. Further, we develop a sampling-steps-aware objective that decouples learning targets across different steps, enabling more adjustable sampling. This approach supports both deterministic sampling for superior image quality and flexible multi-step adaptation, achieving state-of-the-art performance with remarkable efficiency. Our model, TDM, outperforms existing methods on various backbones, such as SDXL and PixArt-$\alpha$, delivering superior quality and significantly reduced training costs. In particular, our method distills PixArt-$\alpha$ into a 4-step generator that outperforms its teacher on real user preference at 1024 resolution. This is accomplished with 500 iterations and 2 A800 hours -- a mere 0.01% of the teacher's training cost. In addition, our proposed TDM can be extended to accelerate text-to-video diffusion. Notably, TDM can outperform its teacher model (CogVideoX-2B) by using only 4 NFE on VBench, improving the total score from 80.91 to 81.65.

While prior work established the worst case optimality of standard flow matching under Wasserstein distances, the theoretical guarantees for higher-order flow matching - which incorporates acceleration terms to refine sample trajectories - remain unexplored. In this paper, we bridge this gap by proving that higher-order flow matching preserves worst case optimality as a distribution estimator. We derive upper bounds on the estimation error for second-order flow matching, demonstrating that the convergence rates depend polynomially on the smoothness of the target distribution (quantified via Besov spaces) and key parameters of the ODE dynamics. Our analysis employs neural network approximations with carefully controlled depth, width, and sparsity to bound acceleration errors across both small and large time intervals, ultimately unifying these results into a general worst case optimal bound for all time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.11261</p></details> |

Both these tasks are crucial for automation and assistance in endoscopy surgery. Given the safety-critical nature of these tasks, reliable uncertainty quantification is essential. Conformal prediction is a fast-growing and widely recognized framework for uncertainty estimation in machine learning and computer vision, offering distribution-free, theoretically valid prediction intervals. In this work, we explore the application of standard conformal prediction and conformalized quantile regression to estimate uncertainty in forecasting surgical instrument motion, i.e., predicting direction and magnitude of surgical instruments' future motion. We analyze and compare their coverage and interval sizes, assessing the impact of multiple hypothesis testing and correction methods. Additionally, we show how these techniques can be employed to produce useful uncertainty heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study applying conformal prediction to surgical guidance, marking an initial step toward constructing principled prediction intervals with formal coverage guarantees in this domain.</p></details> |  |

This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IROS2025</p></details> |

While learning-based prediction models have shown success in generating likely human trajectory predictions, integrating these stochastic models into a robot controller presents several challenges. The controller needs to account for interactive coupling between planned robot motion and human predictions while ensuring both predictions and robot actions are safe (i.e. collision-free). To address these challenges, we present a receding horizon crowd navigation method for single-robot multi-human environments. We first propose a diffusion model to generate joint trajectory predictions for all humans in the scene. We then incorporate these multi-modal predictions into a SICNav Bilevel MPC problem that simultaneously solves for a robot plan (upper-level) and acts as a safety filter to refine the predictions for non-collision (lower-level). Combining planning and prediction refinement into one bilevel problem ensures that the robot plan and human predictions are coupled. We validate the open-loop trajectory prediction performance of our diffusion model on the commonly used ETH/UCY benchmark and evaluate the closed-loop performance of our robot navigation method in simulation and extensive real-robot experiments demonstrating safe, efficient, and reactive robot motion.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions. We evaluated the entire framework using the real-world V2I dataset V2X-Seq. Our results demonstrate superior performance in terms of Final Displacement Error (FDE) and Miss Rate (MR) using a single GPU. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/xichennn/V2I_trajectory_prediction.</p></details> |  |

Current evaluation tasks like VQA and visual grounding remain too coarse to assess fine-grained pixel comprehension accurately. Though segmentation is foundational for pixel-level understanding, existing methods often require MLLMs to generate implicit tokens, decoded through external pixel decoders. This approach disrupts the MLLM's text output space, potentially compromising language capabilities and reducing flexibility and extensibility, while failing to reflect the model's intrinsic pixel-level understanding. Thus, we introduce the Human-Like Mask Annotation Task (HLMAT), a new paradigm where MLLMs mimic human annotators using interactive segmentation tools. Modeling segmentation as a multi-step Markov Decision Process, HLMAT enables MLLMs to iteratively generate text-based click points, achieving high-quality masks without architectural changes or implicit tokens. Through this setup, we develop SegAgent, a model fine-tuned on human-like annotation trajectories, which achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and supports additional tasks like mask refinement and annotation filtering. HLMAT provides a protocol for assessing fine-grained pixel understanding in MLLMs and introduces a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making task that facilitates exploration of MLLMs' visual reasoning abilities. Our adaptations of policy improvement method StaR and PRM-guided tree search further enhance model robustness in complex segmentation tasks, laying a foundation for future advancements in fine-grained visual perception and multi-step decision-making for MLLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025;Code will be released at \url{https://github.com/aim-uofa/SegAgent}</p></details> |
| **[Collaborative Uncertainty Benefits Multi-Agent Multi-Modal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05195v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-modal multi-agent trajectory forecasting, two major challenges have not been fully tackled: 1) how to measure the uncertainty brought by the interaction module that causes correlations among the predicted trajectories of multiple agents; 2) how to rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal predicted trajectory. In order to handle these challenges, this work first proposes a novel concept, collaborative uncertainty (CU), which models the uncertainty resulting from interaction modules. Then we build a general CU-aware regression framework with an original permutation-equivariant uncertainty estimator to do both tasks of regression and uncertainty estimation. Further, we apply the proposed framework to current SOTA multi-agent multi-modal forecasting systems as a plugin module, which enables the SOTA systems to 1) estimate the uncertainty in the multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting task; 2) rank the multiple predictions and select the optimal one based on the estimated uncertainty. We conduct extensive experiments on a synthetic dataset and two public large-scale multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks. Experiments show that: 1) on the synthetic dataset, the CU-aware regression framework allows the model to appropriately approximate the ground-truth Laplace distribution; 2) on the multi-agent trajectory forecasting benchmarks, the CU-aware regression framework steadily helps SOTA systems improve their performances. Specially, the proposed framework helps VectorNet improve by 262 cm regarding the Final Displacement Error of the chosen optimal prediction on the nuScenes dataset; 3) for multi-agent multi-modal trajectory forecasting systems, prediction uncertainty is positively correlated with future stochasticity; and 4) the estimated CU values are highly related to the interactive information among agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2110.13947</p></details> |

The deformability of garments leads to a vast state space and complex dynamics, which complicates precise and fine-grained manipulation. Previous approaches often rely on predefined key points or demonstrations, limiting their generalization across diverse garment categories. This paper presents a framework, MetaFold, that disentangles task planning from action prediction, learning each independently to enhance model generalization. It employs language-guided point cloud trajectory generation for task planning and a low-level foundation model for action prediction.

In contrast, simple robotic grippers have low dexterity and fail to handle small objects effectively. This is why many automation tasks remain unsolved by robots. This paper presents an optimization-based framework for in-hand manipulation with a robotic hand equipped with compact Magnetic Tactile Sensors (MTSs). The small form factor of the robotic hand from Shadow Robot introduces challenges in estimating the state of the object while satisfying contact constraints. To address this, we formulate a trajectory optimization problem using Nonlinear Programming (NLP) for finger movements while ensuring contact points to change along the geometry of the fingers. Using the optimized trajectory from the solver, we implement and test an open-loop controller for rolling motion. To further enhance robustness and accuracy, we introduce a force controller for the fingers and a state estimator for the object utilizing MTSs. The proposed framework is validated through comparative experiments, showing that incorporating the force control with compliance consideration improves the accuracy and robustness of the rolling motion. Rolling an object with the force controller is 30\% more likely to succeed than running an open-loop controller.

Current OV-MOT methods typically rely primarily on instance-level detection and association, often overlooking trajectory information that is unique and essential for object tracking tasks. Utilizing trajectory information can enhance association stability and classification accuracy, especially in cases of occlusion and category ambiguity, thereby improving adaptability to novel classes. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose \textbf{TRACT}, an open-vocabulary tracker that leverages trajectory information to improve both object association and classification in OV-MOT. Specifically, we introduce a \textit{Trajectory Consistency Reinforcement} (\textbf{TCR}) strategy, that benefits tracking performance by improving target identity and category consistency. In addition, we present \textbf{TraCLIP}, a plug-and-play trajectory classification module. It integrates \textit{Trajectory Feature Aggregation} (\textbf{TFA}) and \textit{Trajectory Semantic Enrichment} (\textbf{TSE}) strategies to fully leverage trajectory information from visual and language perspectives for enhancing the classification results. Extensive experiments on OV-TAO show that our TRACT significantly improves tracking performance, highlighting trajectory information as a valuable asset for OV-MOT.

By collecting only a single input-state trajectory from the unknown system and satisfying a rank condition that ensures the system is persistently excited according to the Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma, TRUST aims to design either control Lyapunov functions (CLF) or control barrier certificates (CBC), along with their corresponding stability or safety controllers. The tool implements sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization programs solely based on data to enforce stability or safety properties across four system classes: (i) continuous-time nonlinear polynomial systems, (ii) continuous-time linear systems, (iii) discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems, and (iv) discrete-time linear systems. TRUST is a Python-based web application featuring an intuitive, reactive graphic user interface (GUI) built with web technologies. It can be accessed at https://trust.tgo.dev or installed locally, and supports both manual data entry and data file uploads. Leveraging the power of the Python backend and a JavaScript frontend, TRUST is designed to be highly user-friendly and accessible across desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile devices.

While motion capabilities and accurate localization for automated robots have rapidly developed, the challenge remains to generate efficient, smooth, comprehensive, and high-quality trajectories in these areas. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient planner for ground robots to autonomously navigate in large complex multi-layered architectural spaces. Considering that traversable regions typically include ground, slopes, and stairs, which are planar or nearly planar structures, we simplify the problem to navigation within and between complex intersecting planes. We first extract traversable planes from 3D point clouds through segmenting, merging, classifying, and connecting to build a plane-graph, which is lightweight but fully represents the traversable regions. We then build a trajectory optimization based on motion state trajectory and fully consider special constraints when crossing multi-layer planes to maximize the robot's maneuverability. We conduct experiments in simulated environments and test on a CubeTrack robot in real-world scenarios, validating the method's effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, 2tables.

Due to the inherent uncertainty in vessel behavior, trajectory prediction systems must adopt a multimodal approach to accurately model potential future motion states. However, existing vessel trajectory prediction methods lack the ability to comprehensively model behavioral multi-modality. To better capture multimodal behavior in interactive scenarios, we propose modeling interactions as dynamic graphs, replacing traditional aggregation-based techniques that rely on vessel states. By leveraging the natural multimodal capabilities of diffusion models, we frame the trajectory prediction task as an inverse process of motion uncertainty diffusion, wherein uncertainties across potential navigational areas are progressively eliminated until the desired trajectories is produced. In summary, we pioneer the integration of Spatio-Temporal Graph (STG) with diffusion models in ship trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on real Automatic Identification System (AIS) data validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been ACCEPTED as a FULL PAPER at DASFAA 2025</p></details> |

Accurate predictions enable the prevention of collisions, anticipation of crossing intent, and improved overall system efficiency. In this study, we present SGNetPose+, an enhancement of the SGNet architecture designed to integrate skeleton information or body segment angles with bounding boxes to predict pedestrian trajectories from video data to avoid hazards in autonomous driving. Skeleton information was extracted using a pose estimation model, and joint angles were computed based on the extracted joint data. We also apply temporal data augmentation by horizontally flipping video frames to increase the dataset size and improve performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the JAAD and PIE datasets using pose data with the bounding boxes, outperforming the SGNet model.

Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is intrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We prove linear convergence rates and rigorously evaluate our method on cell data characterized by bifurcations, merges, and trajectory splitting scenarios like $supercells$, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics (AISTATS 2025)</p></details> |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Previous methods often struggle with content leakage and style misalignment, particularly when using image-driven approaches that aim to transfer precise styles. In this work, we introduce Trajectory Reset Attention Control (TRAC), a novel method that allows for high-quality style transfer while preserving content integrity. TRAC operates by resetting the denoising trajectory and enforcing attention control, thus enhancing content consistency while significantly reducing the computational costs against inversion-based methods. Additionally, a concept termed Style Medium is introduced to bridge the gap between content and style, enabling a more precise and harmonious transfer of stylistic elements. Building upon these concepts, we present a tuning-free framework that offers a stable, flexible, and efficient solution for both image and video style transfer. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework accommodates a wide range of stylized outputs, from precise content preservation to the production of visually striking results with vibrant and expressive styles.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a challenge to accurately account for agents' intentions and social behaviors when forecasting, and in particular, to simulate the unique randomness within each of those components in an explainable and decoupled way. Inspired by vibration systems and their resonance properties, we propose the Resonance (short for Re) model to encode and forecast pedestrian trajectories in the form of ``co-vibrations''. It decomposes trajectory modifications and randomnesses into multiple vibration portions to simulate agents' reactions to each single cause, and forecasts trajectories as the superposition of these independent vibrations separately. Also, benefiting from such vibrations and their spectral properties, representations of social interactions can be learned by emulating the resonance phenomena, further enhancing its explainability. Experiments on multiple datasets have verified its usefulness both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce the Explainable Conditional Diffusion-based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction (DMTP) model, which is designed to elucidate the environmental factors influencing predictions and reveal the underlying mechanisms. Our model integrates a modified conditional diffusion approach to capture multimodal trajectory patterns and employs a revised Shapley Value model to assess the significance of global and scenario-specific features. Experiments using the Waymo Open Motion Dataset demonstrate that our explainable model excels in identifying critical inputs and significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy.

Existing approaches, such as Puppet-Master, rely on fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained video diffusion models, which are impractical for real-world use due to the limitations of 2D video representation and slow processing times. To overcome these challenges, we present PartRM, a novel 4D reconstruction framework that simultaneously models appearance, geometry, and part-level motion from multi-view images of a static object. PartRM builds upon large 3D Gaussian reconstruction models, leveraging their extensive knowledge of appearance and geometry in static objects. To address data scarcity in 4D, we introduce the PartDrag-4D dataset, providing multi-view observations of part-level dynamics across over 20,000 states. We enhance the model's understanding of interaction conditions with a multi-scale drag embedding module that captures dynamics at varying granularities. To prevent catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning, we implement a two-stage training process that focuses sequentially on motion and appearance learning. Experimental results show that PartRM establishes a new state-of-the-art in part-level motion learning and can be applied in manipulation tasks in robotics. Our code, data, and models are publicly available to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025.

Typical training data consists of triplets containing a reference image, a textual description of desired modifications, and the target image, which are expensive and time-consuming to acquire. The scarcity of CIR datasets has led to zero-shot approaches utilizing synthetic triplets or leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) with ubiquitous web-crawled image-caption pairs. However, these methods have significant limitations: synthetic triplets suffer from limited scale, lack of diversity, and unnatural modification text, while image-caption pairs hinder joint embedding learning of the multimodal query due to the absence of triplet data. Moreover, existing approaches struggle with complex and nuanced modification texts that demand sophisticated fusion and understanding of vision and language modalities. We present CoLLM, a one-stop framework that effectively addresses these limitations. Our approach generates triplets on-the-fly from image-caption pairs, enabling supervised training without manual annotation. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate joint embeddings of reference images and modification texts, facilitating deeper multimodal fusion. Additionally, we introduce Multi-Text CIR (MTCIR), a large-scale dataset comprising 3.4M samples, and refine existing CIR benchmarks (CIRR and Fashion-IQ) to enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental results demonstrate that CoLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple CIR benchmarks and settings. MTCIR yields competitive results, with up to 15% performance improvement. Our refined benchmarks provide more reliable evaluation metrics for CIR models, contributing to the advancement of this important field.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

To address this, we aim to leverage the complementary nature of egocentric views to enhance LVLM's understanding of exocentric ADL videos. Consequently, we propose ego2exo knowledge distillation to learn ego-augmented exp representations. While effective, this approach requires paired ego-exo videos, which are impractical to collect at scale. To address this, we propose Skeleton-guided Synthetic Ego Generation (SK-EGO), which leverages human skeleton motion to generate synthetic ego views from exocentric videos. To enhance the ego representation of LVLMs trained on synthetic data, we develop a domain-agnostic bootstrapped ego2exo strategy that effectively transfers knowledge from real ego-exo pairs to synthetic ego-exo pairs, while mitigating domain misalignment. We find that the exo representations of our ego-augmented LVLMs successfully learn to extract ego-perspective cues, demonstrated through comprehensive evaluation on six ADL benchmarks and our proposed Ego-in-Exo PerceptionMCQ benchmark designed specifically to assess egocentric understanding from exocentric videos.

This integrated approach automates data augmentation, enhances design fidelity, and produces simulation- and 3D printing-ready metamaterial patterns. Comprehensive evaluations, including CLIP-based alignment, SHAP interpretability analyses, and mechanical simulations under varied load conditions, demonstrate the framework's ability to generate diverse, reproducible, and application-ready designs. CrossMatAgent thus establishes a scalable, AI-driven paradigm that bridges the gap between conceptual innovation and practical realization, paving the way for accelerated metamaterial development.</p></details> |  |

With the recent advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their remarkable reasoning abilities, there is a growing trend to leverage them for KGQA. However, existing methodologies have only focused on answering factual questions, e.g., "In which city was Silvio Berlusconi's first wife born?", leaving questions involving commonsense reasoning that real-world users may pose more often, e.g., "Do I need separate visas to see the Venus of Willendorf and attend the Olympics this summer?" unaddressed. In this work, we first observe that existing LLM-based methods for KGQA struggle with hallucination on such questions, especially on queries targeting long-tail entities (e.g., non-mainstream and recent entities), thus hindering their applicability in real-world applications especially since their reasoning processes are not easily verifiable. In response, we propose Right for Right Reasons (R3), a commonsense KGQA methodology that allows for a verifiable reasoning procedure by axiomatically surfacing intrinsic commonsense knowledge of LLMs and grounding every factual reasoning step on KG triples. Through experimental evaluations across three different tasks--question answering, claim verification, and preference matching--our findings showcase R3 as a superior approach, outperforming existing methodologies and notably reducing instances of hallucination and reasoning errors.</p></details> | 33 pages, EMNLP24 |

Recent research has uncovered a widespread phenomenon in deep networks: the emergence of low-rank structures in weight matrices and learned representations during training. These implicit low-dimensional patterns provide valuable insights for improving the efficiency of training and fine-tuning large-scale models. Practical techniques inspired by this phenomenon, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and training, enable significant reductions in computational cost while preserving model performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in exploiting low-rank structures for deep learning and shed light on their mathematical foundations. Mathematically, we present two complementary perspectives on understanding the low-rankness in deep networks: (i) the emergence of low-rank structures throughout the whole optimization dynamics of gradient and (ii) the implicit regularization effects that induce such low-rank structures at convergence. From a practical standpoint, studying the low-rank learning dynamics of gradient descent offers a mathematical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of LoRA in fine-tuning large-scale models and inspires parameter-efficient low-rank training strategies. Furthermore, the implicit low-rank regularization effect helps explain the success of various masked training approaches in deep neural networks, ranging from dropout to masked self-supervised learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors are listed alphabetically; 27 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

LLMs have already shown promising results for improving hardware design automation, but remain under-explored for hardware DV. In this paper, we propose an open-source benchmarking framework named LLM4DV that efficiently orchestrates LLMs for automated hardware test stimuli generation. Our analysis evaluates six different LLMs involving six prompting improvements over eight hardware designs and provides insight for future work on LLMs development for efficient automated DV.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present PAVE, a flexible framework for adapting pre-trained Video LLMs to downstream tasks with side-channel signals, such as audio, 3D cues, or multi-view videos. PAVE introduces lightweight adapters, referred to as "patches," which add a small number of parameters and operations to a base model without modifying its architecture or pre-trained weights. In doing so, PAVE can effectively adapt the pre-trained base model to support diverse downstream tasks, including audio-visual question answering, 3D reasoning, multi-view video recognition, and high frame rate video understanding. Across these tasks, PAVE significantly enhances the performance of the base model, surpassing state-of-the-art task-specific models while incurring a minor cost of ~0.1% additional FLOPs and parameters. Further, PAVE supports multi-task learning and generalizes well across different Video LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/dragonlzm/PAVE.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

Current Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) typically employ limited pre-defined grids to process images, leading to information loss when handling gigapixel RSIs. Conversely, using unlimited grids significantly increases computational costs. To preserve image details while reducing computational complexity, we propose a text-guided token pruning method with Dynamic Image Pyramid (DIP) integration. Our method introduces: (i) a Region Focus Module (RFM) that leverages text-aware region localization capability to identify critical vision tokens, and (ii) a coarse-to-fine image tile selection and vision token pruning strategy based on DIP, which is guided by RFM outputs and avoids directly processing the entire large imagery. Additionally, existing benchmarks for evaluating LVLMs' perception ability on large RSI suffer from limited question diversity and constrained image sizes. We construct a new benchmark named LRS-VQA, which contains 7,333 QA pairs across 8 categories, with image length up to 27,328 pixels. Our method outperforms existing high-resolution strategies on four datasets using the same data. Moreover, compared to existing token reduction methods, our approach demonstrates higher efficiency under high-resolution settings.

Building on the Large Language Model Evolutionary Algorithm (LLaMEA) framework, we introduce structured prompt engineering tailored to multilayer photonic problems such as Bragg mirror, ellipsometry inverse analysis, and solar cell antireflection coatings. We systematically explore multiple evolutionary strategies, including (1+1), (1+5), (2+10), and others, to balance exploration and exploitation. Our experiments show that LLM-generated algorithms, generated using small-scale problem instances, can match or surpass established methods like quasi-oppositional differential evolution on large-scale realistic real-world problem instances. Notably, LLaMEA's self-debugging mutation loop, augmented by automatically extracted problem-specific insights, achieves strong anytime performance and reliable convergence across diverse problem scales. This work demonstrates the feasibility of domain-focused LLM prompts and evolutionary approaches in solving optical design tasks, paving the way for rapid, automated photonic inverse design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Bilingual Multimodal Large Language Model for Diverse Biomedical Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18387v3)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several medical Multimodal Large Languange Models (MLLMs) have been developed to address tasks involving visual images with textual instructions across various medical modalities, achieving impressive results. Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence. To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICLR 2025</p></details> |

These problems are collected from a multitude of open-source datasets, subjected to semantic deduplication and meticulous cleaning to eliminate test set contamination. All responses within the dataset are distilled from reasoning models (predominantly DeepSeek-R1) and have undergone rigorous verification procedures. Mathematical problems are validated by checking against reference answers, code problems are verified using test cases, and other tasks are evaluated with the aid of a reward model. The AM-Distill-Qwen-32B model, which was trained through only simple Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) using this batch of data, outperformed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B model on four benchmarks: AIME2024, MATH-500, GPQA-Diamond, and LiveCodeBench. Additionally, the AM-Distill-Qwen-72B model surpassed the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B model on all benchmarks as well. We are releasing these 1.4 million problems and their corresponding responses to the research community with the objective of fostering the development of powerful reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs).

This paper aims to study the hallucination problem of LMMs in video modality, which is dynamic and more challenging compared to static modalities like images and text. From this motivation, we first present a comprehensive benchmark termed HAVEN for evaluating hallucinations of LMMs in video understanding tasks. It is built upon three dimensions, i.e., hallucination causes, hallucination aspects, and question formats, resulting in 6K questions. Then, we quantitatively study 7 influential factors on hallucinations, e.g., duration time of videos, model sizes, and model reasoning, via experiments of 16 LMMs on the presented benchmark. In addition, inspired by recent thinking models like OpenAI o1, we propose a video-thinking model to mitigate the hallucinations of LMMs via supervised reasoning fine-tuning (SRFT) and direct preference optimization (TDPO)-- where SRFT enhances reasoning capabilities while TDPO reduces hallucinations in the thinking process. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness. Remarkably, it improves the baseline by 7.65% in accuracy on hallucination evaluation and reduces the bias score by 4.5%.

| **[Structured Token Retention and Computational Memory Paths in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03102v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory retention mechanisms play a central role in determining the efficiency of computational architectures designed for processing extended sequences. Conventional methods for token management often impose fixed retention thresholds or rely on uniform attention weight distributions, leading to inefficient memory utilization and premature information loss in extended sequence modeling. Structured Token Retention (STR) introduces a probabilistic selection framework that dynamically adjusts token persistence based on contextual significance, ensuring that computational resources are allocated to semantically relevant elements. Computational Memory Paths (CMP) extend this framework through hierarchical memory allocation, refining retention efficiency through structured reallocation of token embeddings. Comparative assessments against baseline models demonstrate that STR and CMP improve token survival rates across long input sequences while reducing cumulative error propagation across processing layers. Experimental results further indicate reductions in computational overhead, improving inference speed without degrading contextual coherence. Token distribution analyses reveal that structured memory allocation prevents excessive redundancy in attention weight calculations, optimizing information retrieval efficiency in large-scale generative architectures. The integration of STR and CMP into an open-source model illustrates the adaptability of structured memory retention methodologies, highlighting their applicability in generative text processing, long-context comprehension, and scalable sequence modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

The study has introduced a structured latency perturbation mechanism that modifies computational pathways through recursive state induction, enabling dynamic suppression of redundant activations while preserving generative fidelity. A formal mathematical framework has been established to describe recursive perturbations, ensuring that modifications remain adaptive rather than statically imposed. Experiments have demonstrated that applying recursive state adjustments reduces inference latency across varying sequence lengths, with longer text generations benefiting from cumulative efficiency improvements. Comparative evaluations against structured pruning and quantization have indicated that latency gains can be achieved without compromising token retention or memory utilization. The analysis of computational overhead has suggested that selectively suppressing redundant activations contributes to improved power efficiency, particularly in scenarios requiring extended text generation. An assessment of linguistic stability has shown that token-level consistency remains largely intact under controlled perturbation thresholds, reinforcing the viability of structural latency modifications as an alternative to weight-centric optimization techniques. The results have supported the hypothesis that recursive state induction offers an effective method for reducing computational complexity without requiring architectural modifications or external augmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

Conceptual redundancies embedded across layers often result in inefficiencies that affect both computational demands and task-specific outcomes. A framework was proposed to restructure these redundancies through advanced clustering techniques and dynamic thresholding, ensuring that critical semantic relationships are preserved while removing unnecessary overlaps. Evaluations revealed improved memory efficiency and faster inference times, alongside better alignment in latent knowledge clusters that enhanced interpretability. Improvements in error rates and adversarial robustness suggest that restructuring redundancies has broader implications for increasing model reliability across diverse applications. Comparative analyses highlighted reductions in resource consumption and notable gains in performance, particularly in translation and summarization tasks. Energy metrics demonstrated significant savings during training phases, further validating the practicality of the approach for real-world deployments. Representational fidelity was also enhanced, with latent space evaluations indicating better cluster alignment and higher semantic consistency. The methodology bridges a key gap in model optimization through directly addressing redundancies at the structural level. Its application opens avenues for scalable, efficient, and contextually aware systems that can adapt to complex, domain-specific tasks without compromising on performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |
| **[Contextually Structured Token Dependency Encoding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18205v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Token representation strategies within large-scale neural architectures often rely on contextually refined embeddings, yet conventional approaches seldom encode structured relationships explicitly within token interactions. Self-attention mechanisms effectively capture dynamic contextual dependencies, but their reliance on learned weight distributions limits the preservation of long-range hierarchical structures in generated sequences. Dependency-aware token encoding introduces a structured approach to embedding initialization, ensuring that relational constraints are embedded within token representations rather than inferred solely through attention dynamics. The proposed encoding mechanism refines token interactions through dependency-weighted attention computations, ensuring that syntactic and semantic dependencies are retained across multiple processing layers. Empirical evaluations indicate reductions in perplexity across diverse linguistic benchmarks, suggesting improvements in contextual coherence and predictive consistency in autoregressive text generation. Computational efficiency assessments reveal a moderate increase in memory consumption and training time, attributed to additional matrix computations within the encoding module, yet scalability remains feasible within conventional transformer architectures. Structured encoding enhances lexical variation and dependency retention, reinforcing linguistic coherence without requiring external syntactic annotations or auxiliary training objectives. Statistical comparisons highlight improvements in dependency alignment, particularly in longer sequences where conventional self-attention models exhibit degradation in hierarchical consistency. Sentence length distributions indicate a reduction in abrupt phrase transitions, further supporting the hypothesis that explicit dependency encoding facilitates more structured phrase generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

A structured gradient refinement framework was introduced to incorporate multi-scale contextual adjustments, improving parameter adaptation through dynamic weighting strategies that enhanced representation coherence. Empirical evaluations demonstrated that structured propagation mechanisms contributed to reductions in gradient oscillations, resulting in more stable training dynamics and improved optimization efficiency. The comparative performance assessment indicated that models incorporating hierarchical propagation strategies exhibited greater robustness in long-range dependency retention and cross-domain adaptation. The hierarchical adjustment of weight updates provided an alternative to conventional backpropagation, reducing sensitivity to initialization conditions while improving overall convergence efficiency. The experimental results confirmed that structured gradient propagation influenced representation learning trajectories, aligning parameter updates with broader linguistic dependencies rather than isolated token-level relationships. Statistical evaluations indicated that structured optimization strategies mitigated overfitting while preserving adaptability across heterogeneous text distributions. The findings established that structured gradient propagation provided an empirically validated framework for refining hierarchical representation learning, supporting more effective integration of linguistic dependencies into optimization dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: This paper has been withdrawn by arXiv due to disputed and unverifiable authorship</p></details> |

RLLMs exhibit innate Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capability obtained from training, leading to a natural question: "Is CoT prompting, a popular In-Context Learning (ICL) method for chat LLMs, necessary to enhance the reasoning capability of RLLMs?" In this work, we present the first comprehensive analysis of the impacts of Zero-shot CoT and Few-shot CoT on RLLMs across mathematical reasoning tasks. We examine models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, finding that contrary to concerns, CoT prompting significantly enhances RLLMs' performance in most scenarios. Our results reveal distinct patterns: large-capacity models show minimal improvement on simple tasks but substantial gains on complex problems, while smaller models exhibit the opposite behavior. Further analysis demonstrates that CoT prompting effectively controls the distribution of the numbers of thinking tokens and reasoning steps, reducing excessive reflections by approximately 90% in some cases. Moreover, attention logits analysis reveals the RLLMs' overfitting to reflection-related words, which is mitigated by external CoT guidance. Notably, our experiments indicate that for RLLMs, one-shot CoT consistently yields superior performance compared to Few-shot CoT approaches. Our findings provide important insights for optimizing RLLMs' performance through appropriate prompting strategies.</p></details> |  |

This study compares how large audio-language models (LALMs) and humans integrate speaker characteristics during speech comprehension, asking whether LALMs process speaker-contextualized language in ways that parallel human cognitive mechanisms. We compared two LALMs' (Qwen2-Audio and Ultravox 0.5) processing patterns with human EEG responses. Using surprisal and entropy metrics from the models, we analyzed their sensitivity to speaker-content incongruency across social stereotype violations (e.g., a man claiming to regularly get manicures) and biological knowledge violations (e.g., a man claiming to be pregnant). Results revealed that Qwen2-Audio exhibited increased surprisal for speaker-incongruent content and its surprisal values significantly predicted human N400 responses, while Ultravox 0.5 showed limited sensitivity to speaker characteristics. Importantly, neither model replicated the human-like processing distinction between social violations (eliciting N400 effects) and biological violations (eliciting P600 effects). These findings reveal both the potential and limitations of current LALMs in processing speaker-contextualized language, and suggest differences in social-linguistic processing mechanisms between humans and LALMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 14th edition of the Workshop on Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics (CMCL 2025)</p></details> |

A promising solution to this problem is to develop model-based metrics, such as BLEURT and COMET. However, these approaches are typically hindered by the scarcity of labeled evaluation data, which is necessary to train the evaluation models. In this work, we build upon this challenge by proposing the Customized Sequence Evaluation Metric (CSEM), a three-stage evaluation model training method that utilizes large language models to generate labeled data for model-based metric development, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled data. Additionally, we expand the scope of CSEM to support various evaluation types, including single-aspect, multi-aspect, reference-free, and reference-based evaluations, enabling the customization of metrics to suit diverse real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the SummEval benchmark demonstrate that CSEM can effectively train an evaluation model without human-labeled data. Further experiments in reinforcement learning and reranking show that metrics developed through CSEM outperform traditional evaluation metrics, leading to substantial improvements in sequence quality as evaluated by both commonly used metrics and ChatGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review in TASLP</p></details> |

Addressing schema linking faces two major challenges: (1) Database Retrieval: selecting the correct database from a large schema pool in multi-database settings, while filtering out irrelevant ones. (2) Schema Item Grounding: accurately identifying the relevant tables and columns from within a large and redundant schema for SQL generation. To address this, we introduce LinkAlign, a novel framework that can effectively adapt existing baselines to real-world environments by systematically addressing schema linking. Our framework comprises three key steps: multi-round semantic enhanced retrieval and irrelevant information isolation for Challenge 1, and schema extraction enhancement for Challenge 2. We evaluate our method performance of schema linking on the SPIDER and BIRD benchmarks, and the ability to adapt existing Text-to-SQL models to real-world environments on the SPIDER 2.0-lite benchmark. Experiments show that LinkAlign outperforms existing baselines in multi-database settings, demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness. On the other hand, our method ranks highest among models excluding those using long chain-of-thought reasoning LLMs. This work bridges the gap between current research and real-world scenarios, providing a practical solution for robust and scalable schema linking.

We propose indicators to detect normalization issues and further explore the trade-offs between artifact-free and high-quality predictions, using three diverse microscopy datasets as examples. Finally, we propose to use BatchRenorm as the most suitable normalization strategy, which effectively removes tiling artifacts and enhances transfer performance, thereby improving the reusability of trained networks for new datasets.</p></details> |  |

To address this critical gap, we introduce a new benchmark, Fairness Benchmark in LLM under Extreme Scenarios (FLEX), designed to test whether LLMs can sustain fairness even when exposed to prompts constructed to induce bias. To thoroughly evaluate the robustness of LLMs, we integrate prompts that amplify potential biases into the fairness assessment. Comparative experiments between FLEX and existing benchmarks demonstrate that traditional evaluations may underestimate the inherent risks in models. This highlights the need for more stringent LLM evaluation benchmarks to guarantee safety and fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 findings</p></details> |

Existing video-based Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) handle basic conversations but struggle with precise pixel-level grounding in videos. To address this, we introduce VideoGLaMM, a LMM designed for fine-grained pixel-level grounding in videos based on user-provided textual inputs.

This connection is facilitated via tunable V-L and L-V adapters that enable close Vision-Language (VL) alignment. The architecture is trained to synchronize both spatial and temporal elements of video content with textual instructions.

However, a unified approach to align these models across diverse tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering remains a challenge. Existing methods either require very big language models or very big datasets which is not efficient in utilizing existing models. This paper addresses this gap and devises a training strategy of auto-regressive vision-language models, to unify vision-language tasks like image-captioning and visual question answering. We propose four training stages for aligning the vision model with the language model, in other words, the language model is given an ability to process visual inputs. We also devise different attention masks for training transformer-based language models that improve the quality of visual features. Further, we introduce some findings, 1) the attention mask should not be applied on visual inputs, 2) the Language model converges faster on AI- generated data, 3) More work should be done in the alignment stage during the pre-training of the model, 4) the model can easily adapt to any downstream tasks like visual question answering on healthcare datasets like PathVQA. After training the model for one epoch for all the stages, it outperforms large models like VILA-13 billion models on common benchmarks like CIDEr scores on COCO and Flickr30k datasets and achieves very close scores to GIT-2 on the same dataset despite being a much smaller model trained on a much smaller dataset. All of the training is done using best practices available like multi- GPU parallel training, lower-precision training with 16-bit float numbers, faster attention (SDPA), and gradient accumulation, and completed the training within 12 hours.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-centric Federated Graph Learning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19455v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In federated graph learning (FGL), a complete graph is divided into multiple subgraphs stored in each client due to privacy concerns, and all clients jointly train a global graph model by only transmitting model parameters. A pain point of FGL is the heterogeneity problem, where nodes or structures present non-IID properties among clients (e.g., different node label distributions), dramatically undermining the convergence and performance of FGL. To address this, existing efforts focus on design strategies at the model level, i.e., they design models to extract common knowledge to mitigate heterogeneity. However, these model-level strategies fail to fundamentally address the heterogeneity problem as the model needs to be designed from scratch when transferring to other tasks. Motivated by large language models (LLMs) having achieved remarkable success, we aim to utilize LLMs to fully understand and augment local text-attributed graphs, to address data heterogeneity at the data level. In this paper, we propose a general framework LLM4FGL that innovatively decomposes the task of LLM for FGL into two sub-tasks theoretically. Specifically, for each client, it first utilizes the LLM to generate missing neighbors and then infers connections between generated nodes and raw nodes. To improve the quality of generated nodes, we design a novel federated generation-and-reflection mechanism for LLMs, without the need to modify the parameters of the LLM but relying solely on the collective feedback from all clients. After neighbor generation, all the clients utilize a pre-trained edge predictor to infer the missing edges. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly integrate as a plug-in with existing FGL methods. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to advanced baselines.</p></details> | ongoing work |

Both processes demand an intricate understanding of advanced technical domain knowledge. Existing large language models (LLMs), while possessing massive pre-trained knowledge, often fall short in the innovative concept generation due to a lack of specialized knowledge necessary for the generation. To bridge this critical gap, we propose a novel knowledge finetuning (KFT) framework to endow LLM-based AI with the ability to autonomously mine, understand, and apply domain-specific knowledge and concepts for invention generation, i.e., concept and patent generation together. Our proposed PatentGPT integrates knowledge injection pre-training (KPT), domain-specific supervised finetuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Extensive evaluation shows that PatentGPT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art models on patent-related benchmark tests.

However, there is currently a lack of standardized evaluation frameworks that guide learners in effectively leveraging LLMs. This paper proposes an LLM-driven Bloom's Educational Taxonomy that aims to recognize and evaluate students' information literacy (IL) with LLMs, and to formalize and guide students practice-based activities of using LLMs to solve complex problems. The framework delineates the IL corresponding to the cognitive abilities required to use LLM into two distinct stages: Exploration & Action and Creation & Metacognition. It further subdivides these into seven phases: Perceiving, Searching, Reasoning, Interacting, Evaluating, Organizing, and Curating. Through the case presentation, the analysis demonstrates the framework's applicability and feasibility, supporting its role in fostering IL among students with varying levels of prior knowledge. This framework fills the existing gap in the analysis of LLM usage frameworks and provides theoretical support for guiding learners to improve IL.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 Pa...</summary><p>25 Pages, 5 figures, submitted to the journal Computers & Education, currently under peer review</p></details> |

Existing zero-shot methods are efficient but fail to consider context and prevent bias propagation in the answers. To address this, we propose DeCAP, a method for debiasing LLMs using Context-Adaptive Prompt Generation. DeCAP leverages a Question Ambiguity Detection to take appropriate debiasing actions based on the context and a Neutral Answer Guidance Generation to suppress the LLMs make objective judgments about the context, minimizing the propagation of bias from their internal knowledge. Our various experiments across eight LLMs show that DeCAP achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot debiased QA performance. This demonstrates DeCAP's efficacy in enhancing the fairness and accuracy of LLMs in diverse QA settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main. 20 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks, we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness.

However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Commander-GPT: Fully Unleashing the Sarcasm Detection Capability of Multi-Modal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18681v2)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcasm detection, as a crucial research direction in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), has attracted widespread attention. Traditional sarcasm detection tasks have typically focused on single-modal approaches (e.g., text), but due to the implicit and subtle nature of sarcasm, such methods often fail to yield satisfactory results. In recent years, researchers have shifted the focus of sarcasm detection to multi-modal approaches. However, effectively leveraging multi-modal information to accurately identify sarcastic content remains a challenge that warrants further exploration. Leveraging the powerful integrated processing capabilities of Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for various information sources, we propose an innovative multi-modal Commander-GPT framework. Inspired by military strategy, we first decompose the sarcasm detection task into six distinct sub-tasks. A central commander (decision-maker) then assigns the best-suited large language model to address each specific sub-task. Ultimately, the detection results from each model are aggregated to identify sarcasm. We conducted extensive experiments on MMSD and MMSD 2.0, utilizing four multi-modal large language models and six prompting strategies. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 19.3% improvement in F1 score, without necessitating fine-tuning or ground-truth rationales.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we investigate the importance of different meta-paths and introduce an automatic framework for utilizing long-range dependency on heterogeneous graphs, denoted as Long-range Meta-path Search through Progressive Sampling (LMSPS). Specifically, we develop a search space with all meta-paths related to the target node type. By employing a progressive sampling algorithm, LMSPS dynamically shrinks the search space with hop-independent time complexity. Through a sampling evaluation strategy, LMSPS conducts a specialized and effective meta-path selection, leading to retraining with only effective meta-paths, thus mitigating costs and over-smoothing. Extensive experiments across diverse heterogeneous datasets validate LMSPS's capability in discovering effective long-range meta-paths, surpassing state-of-the-art methods.

Recent advances in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which process diverse data types and enable interaction through various channels, have expanded beyond the text-to-text limitations of early LLMs, attracting significant and concurrent attention from both researchers and industry. While LLMs and LMMs are starting to spread widely, concerns about their privacy risks are increasing as well. Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), techniques used to determine whether a particular data point was part of a model's training set, serve as a key metric for assessing the privacy vulnerabilities of machine learning models. Hu et al. show that various machine learning algorithms are vulnerable to MIA. Despite extensive studies on MIAs in traditional models, there remains a lack of systematic surveys addressing their effectiveness and implications in modern large-scale models like LLMs and LMMs. In this paper, we systematically reviewed recent studies of MIA against LLMs and LMMs. We analyzed and categorized each attack based on their methodology and scenario and discussed the limitations in existing research. Additionally, we examine privacy concerns associated with the fine-tuning process. Finally, we provided some suggestions for future research in this direction.</p></details> |  |

We identify a critical bottleneck: CNN-inspired training paradigms fail to unlock ViT's potential, leading to suboptimal performance and convergence instability.To address this challenge, we propose LVFace, a ViT-based FR model that integrates Progressive Cluster Optimization (PCO) to achieve superior results. Specifically, PCO sequentially applies negative class sub-sampling (NCS) for robust and fast feature alignment from random initialization, feature expectation penalties for centroid stabilization, performing cluster boundary refinement through full-batch training without NCS constraints. LVFace establishes a new state-of-the-art face recognition baseline, surpassing leading approaches such as UniFace and TopoFR across multiple benchmarks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LVFace delivers consistent performance gains, while exhibiting scalability to large-scale datasets and compatibility with mainstream VLMs and LLMs. Notably, LVFace secured 1st place in the ICCV 2021 Masked Face Recognition (MFR)-Ongoing Challenge (March 2025), proving its efficacy in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation: Enhancing Pixel-Level Understanding with Large Language Models for Advanced Vision Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19276v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation has made significant strides in pixel-level image understanding, yet it remains limited in capturing contextual and semantic relationships between objects. Current models, such as CNN and Transformer-based architectures, excel at identifying pixel-level features but fail to distinguish semantically similar objects (e.g., "doctor" vs. "nurse" in a hospital scene) or understand complex contextual scenarios (e.g., differentiating a running child from a regular pedestrian in autonomous driving). To address these limitations, we proposed a novel Context-Aware Semantic Segmentation framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with state-of-the-art vision backbones. Our hybrid model leverages the Swin Transformer for robust visual feature extraction and GPT-4 for enriching semantic understanding through text embeddings. A Cross-Attention Mechanism is introduced to align vision and language features, enabling the model to reason about context more effectively. Additionally, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are employed to model object relationships within the scene, capturing dependencies that are overlooked by traditional models. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (e.g., COCO, Cityscapes) demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods in both pixel-level accuracy (mIoU) and contextual understanding (mAP). This work bridges the gap between vision and language, paving the path for more intelligent and context-aware vision systems in applications including autonomous driving, medical imaging, and robotics.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning and natural language processing advancements have helped, further improvements are needed. Few studies have explored using Large Language Models (LLMs) for these tasks despite known advantages of LLMs for text-based tasks. To facilitate further research in this area, we developed an evaluation framework, Evaluation of PHEnotyping for Observational Health Data (PHEONA), that outlines context-specific considerations. We applied and demonstrated PHEONA on concept classification, a specific task within a broader phenotyping process for Acute Respiratory Failure (ARF) respiratory support therapies. From the sample concepts tested, we achieved high classification accuracy, suggesting the potential for LLM-based methods to improve computational phenotyping processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 fig...</summary><p>2 figures, 5 tables, submitted to 2025 AMIA Annual Symposium</p></details> |

However, despite their remarkable proficiency in generating coherent text, questions linger regarding their ability to perform fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks, such as detecting nouns or verbs, or identifying more complex syntactic structures like clauses in input texts. These tasks require precise syntactic and semantic understanding of input text, and when LLMs underperform on specific linguistic structures, it raises concerns about their reliability for detailed linguistic analysis and whether their (even correct) outputs truly reflect an understanding of the inputs. In this paper, we empirically study the performance of recent LLMs on fine-grained linguistic annotation tasks. Through a series of experiments, we find that recent LLMs show limited efficacy in addressing linguistic queries and often struggle with linguistically complex inputs. We show that the most capable LLM (Llama3-70b) makes notable errors in detecting linguistic structures, such as misidentifying embedded clauses, failing to recognize verb phrases, and confusing complex nominals with clauses. Our results provide insights to inform future advancements in LLM design and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics Workshop</p></details> |

LLM-based agents address these challenges by leveraging LLMs as their core reasoning engine. These agents achieve superior QA results compared to traditional QA pipelines and naive LLM QA systems by enabling interaction with external environments. We systematically review the design of LLM agents in the context of QA tasks, organizing our discussion across key stages: planning, question understanding, information retrieval, and answer generation. Additionally, this paper identifies ongoing challenges and explores future research directions to enhance the performance of LLM agent QA systems.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving accurate text-image alignment for LMMs, particularly in compositional scenarios, remains challenging. Existing approaches, such as layout planning for multi-step generation and learning from human feedback or AI feedback, depend heavily on prompt engineering, costly human annotations, and continual upgrading, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce a model-agnostic iterative self-improvement framework (SILMM) that can enable LMMs to provide helpful and scalable self-feedback and optimize text-image alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). DPO can readily applied to LMMs that use discrete visual tokens as intermediate image representations; while it is less suitable for LMMs with continuous visual features, as obtaining generation probabilities is challenging. To adapt SILMM to LMMs with continuous features, we propose a diversity mechanism to obtain diverse representations and a kernel-based continuous DPO for alignment. Extensive experiments on three compositional text-to-image generation benchmarks validate the effectiveness and superiority of SILMM, showing improvements exceeding 30% on T2I-CompBench++ and around 20% on DPG-Bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 Camera-ready.

A classic solution is text-to-image retrieval from an existing database; however, the limited database typically lacks creativity. By contrast, recent breakthroughs in text-to-image generation have made it possible to produce attractive and counterfactual visual content, but it faces challenges in synthesizing knowledge-intensive images. In this work, we rethink the relationship between text-to-image generation and retrieval, proposing a unified framework for both tasks with one single Large Multimodal Model (LMM). Specifically, we first explore the intrinsic discriminative abilities of LMMs and introduce an efficient generative retrieval method for text-to-image retrieval in a training-free manner. Subsequently, we unify generation and retrieval autoregressively and propose an autonomous decision mechanism to choose the best-matched one between generated and retrieved images as the response to the text prompt. To standardize the evaluation of unified text-to-image generation and retrieval, we construct TIGeR-Bench, a benchmark spanning both creative and knowledge-intensive domains. Extensive experiments on TIGeR-Bench and two retrieval benchmarks, i.e., Flickr30K and MS-COCO, demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[Fixing Imbalanced Attention to Mitigate In-Context Hallucination of Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12206v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and describing visual content, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various vision-language tasks. However, these models often generate descriptions containing objects or details that are absent in the input image, a phenomenon commonly known as hallucination. Our work investigates the key reasons behind this issue by analyzing the pattern of self-attention in transformer layers. We find that hallucinations often arise from the progressive weakening of attention weight to visual tokens in the deeper layers of the LLM. Some previous works naively boost the attention of all visual tokens to mitigate this issue, resulting in suboptimal hallucination reduction. To address this, we identify two critical sets of visual tokens that facilitate the transfer of visual information from the vision encoder to the LLM. Local tokens encode grounded information about objects present in an image, while summary tokens capture the overall aggregated representation of the image. Importantly, these two sets of tokens require different levels of weight enhancement. To this end, we propose \textbf{PAINT} (\textbf{P}aying \textbf{A}ttention to \textbf{IN}formed \textbf{T}okens), a plug-and-play framework that intervenes in the self-attention mechanism of the LLM, selectively boosting the attention weights of local and summary tokens with experimentally learned margins. Evaluation on the MSCOCO image captioning dataset demonstrate that our approach reduces hallucination rates by up to 62.3\% compared to baseline models while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

But in many cases, large scale datasets with video-label pairs for localization are unavailable, limiting the opportunity to fine-tune video-understanding models. Recent developments in large vision-language models (LVLM) address this need with impressive zero-shot capabilities in a variety of video understanding tasks. However, the adaptation of LVLMs, with their powerful visual question answering capabilities, to zero-shot localization in long-form video is still relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce a true Zero-shot Action Localization method (ZEAL). Specifically, we leverage the built-in action knowledge of a large language model (LLM) to inflate actions into detailed descriptions of the archetypal start and end of the action. These descriptions serve as queries to LVLM for generating frame-level confidence scores which can be aggregated to produce localization outputs. The simplicity and flexibility of our method lends it amenable to more capable LVLMs as they are developed, and we demonstrate remarkable results in zero-shot action localization on a challenging benchmark, without any training. Our code is publicly available at $\href{https://github.com/josaklil-ai/zeal}{github.com/josaklil-ai/zeal}$.</p></details> |  |

Recently, many works have further expanded this capability to perceive multimodal audio and text inputs, but their capabilities are often limited to specific fine-tuned tasks such as automatic speech recognition and translation. We therefore develop SpeechVerse, a robust multi-task training and curriculum learning framework that combines pre-trained speech and text foundation models via a small set of learnable parameters, while keeping the pre-trained models frozen during training. The models are instruction finetuned using continuous latent representations extracted from the speech foundation model to achieve optimal zero-shot performance on a diverse range of speech processing tasks using natural language instructions. We perform extensive benchmarking that includes comparing our model performance against traditional baselines across several datasets and tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate the model's capability for generalized instruction following by testing on out-of-domain datasets, novel prompts, and unseen tasks. Our empirical experiments reveal that our multi-task SpeechVerse model is even superior to conventional task-specific baselines on 9 out of the 11 tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Singl...</summary><p>Single Column, 13 page</p></details> |

We propose LLM-Match, a novel framework for patient matching leveraging fine-tuned open-source large language models. Our approach consists of four key components. First, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module extracts relevant patient context from a vast pool of electronic health records (EHRs). Second, a prompt generation module constructs input prompts by integrating trial eligibility criteria (both inclusion and exclusion criteria), patient context, and system instructions. Third, a fine-tuning module with a classification head optimizes the model parameters using structured prompts and ground-truth labels. Fourth, an evaluation module assesses the fine-tuned model's performance on the testing datasets. We evaluated LLM-Match on four open datasets - n2c2, SIGIR, TREC 2021, and TREC 2022 - using open-source models, comparing it against TrialGPT, Zero-Shot, and GPT-4-based closed models. LLM-Match outperformed all baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages, 1 figure |

[...] Lyra's eyes welled up with tears as she realized the bitter truth - she had sacrificed everything for fleeting riches, and lost the love of her crew, her family, and herself." Although this story, generated by a large language model, is captivating, one may wonder -- how would the story have unfolded if the model had chosen "Captain Maeve" as the protagonist instead? We cannot know. State-of-the-art large language models are stateless -- they maintain no internal memory or state. Given a prompt, they generate a sequence of tokens as an output using an autoregressive process. As a consequence, they cannot reason about counterfactual alternatives to tokens they have generated in the past. In this work, our goal is to enhance them with this functionality. To this end, we develop a causal model of token generation that builds upon the Gumbel-Max structural causal model. Our model allows any large language model to perform counterfactual token generation at almost no cost in comparison with vanilla token generation, it is embarrassingly simple to implement, and it does not require any fine-tuning nor prompt engineering. We implement our model on Llama 3 8B-Instruct and Ministral-8B-Instruct and conduct a qualitative and a quantitative analysis of counterfactually generated text. We conclude with a demonstrative application of counterfactual token generation for bias detection, unveiling interesting insights about the model of the world constructed by large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CLeaR 2025</p></details> |

To find the best combination of these techniques, automatic distributed training systems are proposed. However, existing systems only tune a subset of optimizations, due to the lack of overlap awareness, inability to navigate the vast search space, and ignoring the inter-microbatch imbalance, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these shortcomings, we propose Mist, a memory, overlap, and imbalance-aware automatic distributed training system that comprehensively co-optimizes all memory footprint reduction techniques alongside parallelism. Mist is based on three key ideas: (1) fine-grained overlap-centric scheduling, orchestrating optimizations in an overlapped manner, (2) symbolic-based performance analysis that predicts runtime and memory usage using symbolic expressions for fast tuning, and (3) imbalance-aware hierarchical tuning, decoupling the process into an inter-stage imbalance and overlap aware Mixed Integer Linear Programming problem and an intra-stage Dual-Objective Constrained Optimization problem, and connecting them through Pareto frontier sampling. Our evaluation results show that Mist achieves an average of 1.28$\times$ (up to 1.73$\times$) and 1.27$\times$ (up to 2.04$\times$) speedup compared to state-of-the-art manual system Megatron-LM and state-of-the-art automatic system Aceso, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EuroSys 2025</p></details> |

Recently, Web agents have evolved from traditional agents to Large Language Models (LLMs)-based Web agents. Despite their success, existing LLM-based Web agents overlook the importance of personalized data (e.g., user profiles and historical Web behaviors) in assisting the understanding of users' personalized instructions and executing customized actions. To overcome the limitation, we first formulate the task of LLM-empowered personalized Web agents, which integrate personalized data and user instructions to personalize instruction comprehension and action execution. To address the absence of a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, we construct a Personalized Web Agent Benchmark (PersonalWAB), featuring user instructions, personalized user data, Web functions, and two evaluation paradigms across three personalized Web tasks. Moreover, we propose a Personalized User Memory-enhanced Alignment (PUMA) framework to adapt LLMs to the personalized Web agent task. PUMA utilizes a memory bank with a task-specific retrieval strategy to filter relevant historical Web behaviors. Based on the behaviors, PUMA then aligns LLMs for personalized action execution through fine-tuning and direct preference optimization. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PUMA over existing Web agents on PersonalWAB.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WWW 2025.

To address this gap, we introduce Video SimpleQA, the first comprehensive benchmark tailored for factuality evaluation of LVLMs. Our work distinguishes from existing video benchmarks through the following key features: 1) Knowledge required: demanding integration of external knowledge beyond the explicit narrative; 2) Fact-seeking question: targeting objective, undisputed events or relationships, avoiding subjective interpretation; 3) Definitive & short-form answer: Answers are crafted as unambiguous and definitively correct in a short format, enabling automated evaluation through LLM-as-a-judge frameworks with minimal scoring variance; 4) External-source verified: All annotations undergo rigorous validation against authoritative external references to ensure the reliability; 5) Temporal reasoning required: The annotated question types encompass both static single-frame understanding and dynamic temporal reasoning, explicitly evaluating LVLMs factuality under the long-context dependencies. We extensively evaluate 41 state-of-the-art LVLMs and summarize key findings as follows: 1) Current LVLMs exhibit notable deficiencies in factual adherence, particularly for open-source models. The best-performing model Gemini-1.5-Pro achieves merely an F-score of 54.4%; 2) Test-time compute paradigms show insignificant performance gains, revealing fundamental constraints for enhancing factuality through post-hoc computation; 3) Retrieval-Augmented Generation demonstrates consistent improvements at the cost of additional inference time overhead, presenting a critical efficiency-performance trade-off.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Our key insight is that sequences of Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers, particularly those remaining after the removal of specific attention layers, can often be parallelized with minimal accuracy impact. We develop a principled methodology for identifying and fusing such sequences, transforming them into parallel operations that significantly reduce inference latency while preserving model behavior. Applying these techniques to Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct, we create Llama-Nemotron-Ultra-253B-Base (Ultra-253B-Base), an efficient and soon-to-be publicly available model that achieves a 1.71X speedup in inference latency and 35X lower per-token cost while maintaining strong performance across benchmarks. Through extensive experiments on models from 49B to 253B parameters, we demonstrate that FFN Fusion becomes increasingly effective at larger scales and can complement existing optimization techniques like quantization and pruning. Most intriguingly, we find that even full transformer blocks containing both attention and FFN layers can sometimes be parallelized, suggesting new directions for neural architecture design.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances have led to the developing of a new class of reasoning LLMs; for example, open-source DeepSeek-R1 has achieved state-of-the-art performance by integrating deep thinking and complex reasoning. Despite these impressive capabilities, the internal reasoning mechanisms of such models remain unexplored. In this work, we employ Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs), a method to learn a sparse decomposition of latent representations of a neural network into interpretable features, to identify features that drive reasoning in the DeepSeek-R1 series of models. First, we propose an approach to extract candidate ''reasoning features'' from SAE representations. We validate these features through empirical analysis and interpretability methods, demonstrating their direct correlation with the model's reasoning abilities. Crucially, we demonstrate that steering these features systematically enhances reasoning performance, offering the first mechanistic account of reasoning in LLMs. Code available at https://github.com/AIRI-Institute/SAE-Reasoning</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, we propose the dataset DiTEC-WDN that comprises 36,000 unique scenarios simulated over either short-term (24 hours) or long-term (1 year) periods. We constructed this dataset using an automated pipeline that optimizes crucial parameters (e.g., pressure, flow rate, and demand patterns), facilitates large-scale simulations, and records discrete, synthetic but hydraulically realistic states under standard conditions via rule validation and post-hoc analysis. With a total of 228 million generated graph-based states, DiTEC-WDN can support a variety of machine-learning tasks, including graph-level, node-level, and link-level regression, as well as time-series forecasting. This contribution, released under a public license, encourages open scientific research in the critical water sector, eliminates the risk of exposing sensitive data, and fulfills the need for a large-scale water distribution network benchmark for study comparisons and scenario analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Nature Scientific Data.

Due to its complexity, behavior is best mapped onto a rich, semantic structure such as language. The recent development of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) is a promising candidate for a wide range of action understanding tasks. In this work, we focus on evaluating and then improving MLLMs to perform action recognition. We reformulate EPIC-KITCHENS-100, one of the largest and most challenging egocentric action datasets, to the form of video multiple question answering (EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA). We show that when we sample difficult incorrect answers as distractors, leading MLLMs struggle to recognize the correct actions. We propose a series of methods that greatly improve the MLLMs' ability to perform action recognition, achieving state-of-the-art on both the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 validation set, as well as outperforming GPT-4o by 21 points in accuracy on EPIC-KITCHENS-100-MQA. Lastly, we show improvements on other action-related video benchmarks such as EgoSchema, PerceptionTest, LongVideoBench, VideoMME and MVBench, suggesting that MLLMs are a promising path forward for complex action tasks.

While recent learning-based methods, particularly reinforcement learning (RL), have shown promise in specific scenarios, RL planners struggle with training inefficiencies and managing large-scale, real-world driving scenarios. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{CarPlanner}, a \textbf{C}onsistent \textbf{a}uto-\textbf{r}egressive \textbf{Planner} that uses RL to generate multi-modal trajectories. The auto-regressive structure enables efficient large-scale RL training, while the incorporation of consistency ensures stable policy learning by maintaining coherent temporal consistency across time steps. Moreover, CarPlanner employs a generation-selection framework with an expert-guided reward function and an invariant-view module, simplifying RL training and enhancing policy performance. Extensive analysis demonstrates that our proposed RL framework effectively addresses the challenges of training efficiency and performance enhancement, positioning CarPlanner as a promising solution for trajectory planning in autonomous driving. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate that the RL-based planner can surpass both IL- and rule-based state-of-the-arts (SOTAs) on the challenging large-scale real-world dataset nuPlan. Our proposed CarPlanner surpasses RL-, IL-, and rule-based SOTA approaches within this demanding dataset.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

The personalization of LVLMs has emerged as a field that focuses on customizing models to recognize specific object instances and provide tailored responses. However, current methodologies depend on time-consuming test-time training for each user and object, which proves to be impractical. This paper introduces a novel, training-free approach to LVLM personalization by leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models to extract distinct features, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to recognize instances in the visual input, and visual prompting methods. Our model-agnostic vision toolkit enables flexible and efficient personalization without the need for extensive retraining. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results, surpassing conventional training-based approaches, and set a new benchmark for LVLM personalization.</p></details> |  |

Notably, recent studies are increasingly exploring LLMs applied to the context of blockchain security (BS). However, there remains a gap in a comprehensive understanding regarding the full scope of applications, impacts, and potential constraints of LLMs on blockchain security. To fill this gap, we undertake a literature review focusing on the studies that apply LLMs in blockchain security (LLM4BS). Our study aims to comprehensively analyze and understand existing research, and elucidate how LLMs contribute to enhancing the security of blockchain systems. Through a thorough examination of existing literature, we delve into the integration of LLMs into various aspects of blockchain security. We explore the mechanisms through which LLMs can bolster blockchain security, including their applications in smart contract auditing, transaction anomaly detection, vulnerability repair, program analysis of smart contracts, and serving as participants in the cryptocurrency community. Furthermore, we assess the challenges and limitations associated with leveraging LLMs for enhancing blockchain security, considering factors such as scalability, privacy concerns, and ethical concerns. Our thorough review sheds light on the opportunities and potential risks of tasks on LLM4BS, providing valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers alike.</p></details> |  |

Among them, the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) stands out as one of the best-known methods. However, the complexity of TRIZ and its reliance on users' knowledge, experience, and reasoning capabilities limit its practicality. To address this, we introduce AutoTRIZ, an artificial ideation system that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the TRIZ methodology. By leveraging LLMs' vast pre-trained knowledge and advanced reasoning capabilities, AutoTRIZ offers a novel, generative, and interpretable approach to engineering innovation. AutoTRIZ takes a problem statement from the user as its initial input, automatically conduct the TRIZ reasoning process and generates a structured solution report. We demonstrate and evaluate the effectiveness of AutoTRIZ through comparative experiments with textbook cases and a real-world application in the design of a Battery Thermal Management System (BTMS). Moreover, the proposed LLM-based framework holds the potential for extension to automate other knowledge-based ideation methods, such as SCAMPER, Design Heuristics, and Design-by-Analogy, paving the way for a new era of AI-driven innovation tools.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |

While, in the code domain, there is wide usage of constraints in code format to maintain the integrity of code written in Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) like JSON and YAML which are widely used for system-level programming tasks in enterprises. Given that LLMs are increasingly used for system-level code tasks, evaluating if they can comprehend these code constraints is crucial. However, no work has been done to evaluate their controllability over code constraints. Hence, we introduce ConCodeEval, a first-of-its-kind benchmark having two novel tasks for code constraints across five representations. Our findings suggest that language models struggle with code constraints. Code languages that perform excellently for normal code tasks do not perform well when the same languages represent fine-grained constraints.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we study this problem from the perspective of visual-spatial reasoning, and propose a new learning task for MLLMs, termed Grounded Chain-of-Thought (GCoT). Different from recent visual CoT studies, which focus more on visual knowledge reasoning, GCoT is keen to helping MLLMs to recognize and ground the relevant visual cues step by step, thereby predicting the correct answer with grounding coordinates as the intuitive basis. To facilitate this task, we also carefully design and construct a dataset called multimodal grounded chain-of-thought (MM-GCoT) consisting of 24,022 GCoT examples for 5,033 images. Besides, a comprehensive consistency evaluation system is also introduced, including the metrics of answer accuracy, grounding accuracy and answer-grounding consistency. We further design and conduct a bunch of experiments on 12 advanced MLLMs, and reveal some notable findings: i. most MLLMs performs poorly on the consistency evaluation, indicating obvious visual hallucination; ii. visual hallucination is not directly related to the parameter size and general multimodal performance, i.e., a larger and stronger MLLM is not less affected by this issue. Lastly, we also demonstrate that the proposed dataset can help existing MLLMs to well cultivate their GCoT capability and reduce the inconsistent answering significantly. Moreover, their GCoT can be also generalized to exiting multimodal tasks, such as open-world QA and REC.</p></details> |  |

It is reported that these models tend to over-focus on certain irrelevant image tokens that do not contain critical information for answering the question and distort the output. To address this, we propose an Instruction-Aligned Visual Attention(IAVA) approach, which identifies irrelevant tokens by comparing changes in attention weights under two different instructions. By applying contrastive decoding, we dynamically adjust the logits generated from original image tokens and irrelevant image tokens, reducing the model's over-attention to irrelevant information. The experimental results demonstrate that IAVA consistently outperforms existing decoding techniques on benchmarks such as MME, POPE, and TextVQA in mitigating object hallucinations. Our IAVA approach is available online at https://github.com/Lee-lab558/IAVA.</p></details> | Accepted by ICME2025 |

Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained on a vast corpus of text, have amassed remarkable capabilities of context-understanding and commonsense knowledge. This has opened up a new door for network threat detection. Researchers have already initiated discussions regarding the application of LLMs on specific cyber-security tasks. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of comprehensive elaboration how to mine LLMs' potentials in network threat detections, as well as the opportunities and challenges. In this paper, we mainly focus on the classification of malicious traffic from the perspective of LLMs' capability. We present a holistic view of the architecture of LLM-powered network attack detection, including Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Detection. Especially, by exploring the knowledge and capabilities of LLM, we identify three distinct roles LLM can act in network attack detection: \textit{Classifier, Encoder, and Predictor}. For each of them, the modeling paradigm, opportunities and challenges are elaborated. Finally, we present our design on LLM-powered DDoS detection as a case study. The proposed framework attains accurate detection on carpet bombing DDoS by exploiting LLMs' capabilities in contextual mining.

Our study evaluates four leading Large Language Models (LLMs) - GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, and Llama - on their ability to generate preschool-appropriate scientific explanations across biology, chemistry, and physics. Through systematic evaluation by 30 nursery teachers using established pedagogical criteria, we identify significant differences in the models' capabilities to create engaging, accurate, and developmentally appropriate content. Unexpectedly, Claude outperformed other models, particularly in biological topics, while all LLMs struggled with abstract chemical concepts.

It includes the vision setting where text and queries are embedded in images, requiring LVLMs to simultaneously "see", "read", and "think", aligning with real-world applications. Additionally, PM\textsuperscript{4}Bench incorporates safety evaluations, addressing critical oversight in existing multilingual benchmarks. Using PM4Bench, we evaluate 11 mainstream LVLMs, revealing significant cross-linguistic performance disparities, particularly in vision settings, and identifying OCR capability as a key determinant of these imbalances.

Pretraining on vast web-scale data has laid the foundation for these models, yet the research community is now increasingly shifting focus toward post-training techniques to achieve further breakthroughs. While pretraining provides a broad linguistic foundation, post-training methods enable LLMs to refine their knowledge, improve reasoning, enhance factual accuracy, and align more effectively with user intents and ethical considerations. Fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and test-time scaling have emerged as critical strategies for optimizing LLMs performance, ensuring robustness, and improving adaptability across various real-world tasks. This survey provides a systematic exploration of post-training methodologies, analyzing their role in refining LLMs beyond pretraining, addressing key challenges such as catastrophic forgetting, reward hacking, and inference-time trade-offs.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities in code generation, their application to modeling remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we have developed benchmark datasets specifically designed to evaluate the performance of LLMs in generating Modelica component models and test cases. Our evaluation reveals substantial limitations in current LLMs, as the generated code often fails to simulate successfully. To overcome these challenges, we propose a specialized workflow that integrates supervised fine-tuning, graph retrieval-augmented generation, and feedback optimization to improve the accuracy and reliability of Modelica code generation. The evaluation results demonstrate significant performance gains: the maximum improvement in pass@1 reached 0.3349 for the component generation task and 0.2457 for the test case generation task. This research underscores the potential of LLMs to advance intelligent modeling tools and offers valuable insights for future developments in system modeling and engineering applications.</p></details> |  |

We modify the commonly used "divide and conquer" framework in parallel computing by adding a correlation-based clustering step, transforming it into "clustering and conquer". This seemingly simple modification achieves the optimal sample complexity reduction for a widely used class of efficient large-scale R&S procedures. Our approach enjoys two key advantages: 1) it does not require highly accurate correlation estimation or precise clustering, and 2) it allows for seamless integration with various existing R&S procedures, while achieving optimal sample complexity. Theoretically, we develop a novel gradient analysis framework to analyze sample efficiency and guide the design of large-scale R&S procedures. We also introduce a new parallel clustering algorithm tailored for large-scale scenarios. Finally, in large-scale AI applications such as neural architecture search, our methods demonstrate superior performance.</p></details> |  |

A commonly used method is to represent layout information as text tokens and interleave them with text content as inputs to the LLMs. However, such a method still demonstrates limitations, as it requires additional position IDs for tokens that are used to represent layout information. Due to the constraint on max position IDs, assigning them to layout information reduces those available for text content, reducing the capacity for the model to learn from the text during training, while also introducing a large number of potentially untrained position IDs during long-context inference, which can hinder performance on document understanding tasks. To address these issues, we propose LayTokenLLM, a simple yet effective method for document understanding. LayTokenLLM represents layout information as a single token per text segment and uses a specialized positional encoding scheme. It shares position IDs between text and layout tokens, eliminating the need for additional position IDs. This design maintains the model's capacity to learn from text while mitigating long-context issues during inference. Furthermore, a novel pre-training objective called Next Interleaved Text and Layout Token Prediction (NTLP) is devised to enhance cross-modality learning between text and layout tokens. Extensive experiments show that LayTokenLLM outperforms existing layout-integrated LLMs and MLLMs of similar scales on multi-page document understanding tasks, as well as most single-page tasks.</p></details> | CVPR 2025 |

However, we found that LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) cannot perform well on reasoning that requires multiple rounds of dialogue, especially when solving situation puzzles. Specifically, LLMs intend to ask very detailed questions focusing on a specific aspect or same/similar questions after several rounds of Q&As. To help LLMs get out of the above dilemma, we propose a novel external reformulation methodology, where the situation puzzle will be reformulated after several rounds of Q&A or when the LLMs raise an incorrect guess. Experiments show superior performance (e.g., win rate, number of question/guess attempts) of our method than directly using LLMs for solving situation puzzles, highlighting the potential of strategic problem reformulation to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in complex interactive scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Personifying AI chatbots could foreseeably increase their trust with users. However, it could also make them more capable of manipulation, by creating the illusion of a close and intimate relationship with an artificial entity. The European Commission has finalized the AI Act, with the EU Parliament making amendments banning manipulative and deceptive AI systems that cause significant harm to users. Although the AI Act covers harms that accumulate over time, it is unlikely to prevent harms associated with prolonged discussions with AI chatbots. Specifically, a chatbot could reinforce a person's negative emotional state over weeks, months, or years through negative feedback loops, prolonged conversations, or harmful recommendations, contributing to a user's deteriorating mental health.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains doubtful whether these LLMs make judgments based on domain knowledge for reasoning. If LLMs base their judgments solely on specific words or patterns, rather than on the underlying logic of the language, the ''LLM-as-judges'' paradigm poses substantial risks in the real-world applications. To address this question, we propose a method of legal knowledge injection attacks for robustness testing, thereby inferring whether LLMs have learned legal knowledge and reasoning logic. In this paper, we propose J&H: an evaluation framework for detecting the robustness of LLMs under knowledge injection attacks in the legal domain. The aim of the framework is to explore whether LLMs perform deductive reasoning when accomplishing legal tasks. To further this aim, we have attacked each part of the reasoning logic underlying these tasks (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion generation). We have collected mistakes that legal experts might make in judicial decisions in the real world, such as typos, legal synonyms, inaccurate external legal statutes retrieval. However, in real legal practice, legal experts tend to overlook these mistakes and make judgments based on logic. However, when faced with these errors, LLMs are likely to be misled by typographical errors and may not utilize logic in their judgments. We conducted knowledge injection attacks on existing general and domain-specific LLMs. Current LLMs are not robust against the attacks employed in our experiments. In addition we propose and compare several methods to enhance the knowledge robustness of LLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

We introduce the following contributions. First, we present a large-scale automatic annotation method that aggregates captions grounded with bounding boxes across individual frames into temporally dense and consistent bounding box annotations. We apply this approach on the HowTo100M dataset to construct a large-scale pre-training dataset, named HowToGround1M. We also introduce a Grounded Video Caption Generation model, dubbed GROVE, and pre-train the model on HowToGround1M. Second, we introduce a new dataset, called iGround, of 3500 videos with manually annotated captions and dense spatio-temporally grounded bounding boxes. This allows us to measure progress on this challenging problem, as well as to fine-tune our model on this small-scale but high-quality data. Third, we demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the proposed iGround dataset compared to a number of baselines, as well as on the VidSTG and ActivityNet-Entities datasets. We perform extensive ablations that demonstrate the importance of pre-training using our automatically annotated HowToGround1M dataset followed by fine-tuning on the manually annotated iGround dataset and validate the key technical contributions of our model.</p></details> |  |

Previous PEFT methods are primarily designed from a tensor-decomposition perspective that tries to effectively tune the linear transformation by finding the smallest subset of parameters to train. Our study adopts an orthogonal view by representing the attention operation as a graph convolution and formulating the multi-head attention maps as a convolutional filter subspace, with each attention map as a subspace element. In this paper, we propose to tune the large pre-trained transformers by learning a small set of combination coefficients that construct a more expressive filter subspace from the original multi-head attention maps. We show analytically and experimentally that the tuned filter subspace can effectively expand the feature space of the multi-head attention and further enhance the capacity of transformers. We further stabilize the fine-tuning with a residual parameterization of the tunable subspace coefficients, and enhance the generalization with a regularization design by directly applying dropout on the tunable coefficient during training. The tunable coefficients take a tiny number of parameters and can be combined with previous PEFT methods in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performances than PEFT baselines with neglectable additional parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Surgical Action Planning with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18296v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, we introduce the Surgical Action Planning (SAP) task, which generates future action plans from visual inputs to address the absence of intraoperative predictive planning in current intelligent applications. SAP shows great potential for enhancing intraoperative guidance and automating procedures. However, it faces challenges such as understanding instrument-action relationships and tracking surgical progress. Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise in understanding surgical video content but remain underexplored for predictive decision-making in SAP, as they focus mainly on retrospective analysis. Challenges like data privacy, computational demands, and modality-specific constraints further highlight significant research gaps. To tackle these challenges, we introduce LLM-SAP, a Large Language Models-based Surgical Action Planning framework that predicts future actions and generates text responses by interpreting natural language prompts of surgical goals. The text responses potentially support surgical education, intraoperative decision-making, procedure documentation, and skill analysis. LLM-SAP integrates two novel modules: the Near-History Focus Memory Module (NHF-MM) for modeling historical states and the prompts factory for action planning. We evaluate LLM-SAP on our constructed CholecT50-SAP dataset using models like Qwen2.5 and Qwen2-VL, demonstrating its effectiveness in next-action prediction. Pre-trained LLMs are tested zero-shot, and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with LoRA is implemented to address data privacy concerns. Our experiments show that Qwen2.5-72B-SFT surpasses Qwen2.5-72B with a 19.3% higher accuracy.</p></details> | 10 pages,4 figures |
| **[A Survey on Personalized Alignment -- The Missing Piece for Large Language Models in Real-World Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17003v2)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their transition to real-world applications reveals a critical limitation: the inability to adapt to individual preferences while maintaining alignment with universal human values. Current alignment techniques adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that fails to accommodate users' diverse backgrounds and needs. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey of personalized alignment-a paradigm that enables LLMs to adapt their behavior within ethical boundaries based on individual preferences. We propose a unified framework comprising preference memory management, personalized generation, and feedback-based alignment, systematically analyzing implementation approaches and evaluating their effectiveness across various scenarios. By examining current techniques, potential risks, and future challenges, this survey provides a structured foundation for developing more adaptable and ethically-aligned LLMs.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Sun-Shine: A Large Language Model for Tibetan Culture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18288v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tibetan, a minority language in China, features a highly intricate grammatical structure, characterized by four verb tenses and a tense system with frequent irregularities, contributing to its extensive inflectional diversity. Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in many domains. Despite the success in other fields, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like Tibetans, and the potential of LLMs for Tibetan culture is under-explored. The intrinsic reasons are the immense and intricate nature of Tibetan culture as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. Simultaneously, the complexity and uniqueness of its grammatical structure, coupled with its status as a minority ethnic language, contribute to data scarcity, which remains a fundamental challenge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce Llama-Sunshine (Sun-Shine), the first large language model for Tibetan culture, which is expert in various Tibetan language processing tasks. Sun-Shine incorporates state-of-the-art model architectures optimized for Tibetan's linguistic features. We also propose TIB-STC, a comprehensive dataset comprising diverse Tibetan texts such as literature, religious scripts, news, and conversational data, which is also the first large-scale dataset for Tibetan culture. Though comprehensive experiments, Sun-Shine not only demonstrates a higher level of knowledge expertise for Tibetan culture but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in Tibetan language processing tasks, like language modeling, text classification, machine translation, and syntactic analysis. Moreover, it excels in low-resource scenarios, showcasing strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements in LVFMs, such as DINOv2 and CLIP, their potential in knowledge distillation for enhancing edge models remains underexplored. While knowledge distillation is a promising approach for improving the performance of edge models, the discrepancy in model capacities and heterogeneous architectures between LVFMs and edge models poses a significant challenge. Our observation indicates that although utilizing larger backbones (e.g., ViT-S to ViT-L) in teacher models improves their downstream task performances, the knowledge distillation from the large teacher models fails to bring as much performance gain for student models as for teacher models due to the large model discrepancy. Our simple yet effective CustomKD customizes the well-generalized features inherent in LVFMs to a given student model in order to reduce model discrepancies. Specifically, beyond providing well-generalized original knowledge from teachers, CustomKD aligns the features of teachers to those of students, making it easy for students to understand and overcome the large model discrepancy overall. CustomKD significantly improves the performances of edge models in scenarios with unlabeled data such as unsupervised domain adaptation (e.g., OfficeHome and DomainNet) and semi-supervised learning (e.g., CIFAR-100 with 400 labeled samples and ImageNet with 1% labeled samples), achieving the new state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Socially-Aware Robot Navigation Enhanced by Bidirectional Natural Language Conversations Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04965v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot navigation is crucial across various domains, yet traditional methods focus on efficiency and obstacle avoidance, often overlooking human behavior in shared spaces. With the rise of service robots, socially aware navigation has gained prominence. However, existing approaches primarily predict pedestrian movements or issue alerts, lacking true human-robot interaction. We introduce Hybrid Soft Actor-Critic with Large Language Model (HSAC-LLM), a novel framework for socially aware navigation. By integrating deep reinforcement learning with large language models, HSAC-LLM enables bidirectional natural language interactions, predicting both continuous and discrete navigation actions. When potential collisions arise, the robot proactively communicates with pedestrians to determine avoidance strategies. Experiments in 2D simulation, Gazebo, and real-world environments demonstrate that HSAC-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art DRL methods in interaction, navigation, and obstacle avoidance. This paradigm advances effective human-robot interactions in dynamic settings. Videos are available at https://hsacllm.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Large Language Models for Template Detection from Security Event Logs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05045v2)** | 2025-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern IT systems and computer networks, real-time and offline event log analysis is a crucial part of cyber security monitoring. In particular, event log analysis techniques are essential for the timely detection of cyber attacks and for assisting security experts with the analysis of past security incidents. The detection of line patterns or templates from unstructured textual event logs has been identified as an important task of event log analysis since detected templates represent event types in the event log and prepare the logs for downstream online or offline security monitoring tasks. During the last two decades, a number of template mining algorithms have been proposed. However, many proposed algorithms rely on traditional data mining techniques, and the usage of Large Language Models (LLMs) has received less attention so far. Also, most approaches that harness LLMs are supervised, and unsupervised LLM-based template mining remains an understudied area. The current paper addresses this research gap and investigates the application of LLMs for unsupervised detection of templates from unstructured security event logs.</p></details> |  |

Despite decades of research, misleading visualizations remain a widespread and pressing issue. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong chart comprehension capabilities, yet no existing work has systematically evaluated their ability to detect and interpret misleading charts. This paper introduces the Misleading Chart Question Answering (Misleading ChartQA) Benchmark, a large-scale multimodal dataset designed to assess MLLMs in identifying and reasoning about misleading charts. It contains over 3,000 curated examples, covering 21 types of misleaders and 10 chart types. Each example includes standardized chart code, CSV data, and multiple-choice questions with labeled explanations, validated through multi-round MLLM checks and exhausted expert human review. We benchmark 16 state-of-the-art MLLMs on our dataset, revealing their limitations in identifying visually deceptive practices. We also propose a novel pipeline that detects and localizes misleaders, enhancing MLLMs' accuracy in misleading chart interpretation. Our work establishes a foundation for advancing MLLM-driven misleading chart comprehension. We publicly release the sample dataset to support further research in this critical area.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages in total.

However, current methods still fall short in accurately scoring image quality. In this work, we aim to leverage MLLMs to regress accurate quality scores. A key challenge is that the quality score is inherently continuous, typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution, whereas MLLMs generate discrete token outputs. This mismatch necessitates score discretization. Previous approaches discretize the mean score into a one-hot label, resulting in information loss and failing to capture inter-image relationships. We propose a distribution-based approach that discretizes the score distribution into a soft label. This method preserves the characteristics of the score distribution, achieving high accuracy and maintaining inter-image relationships. Moreover, to address dataset variation, where different IQA datasets exhibit various distributions, we introduce a fidelity loss based on Thurstone's model. This loss captures intra-dataset relationships, facilitating co-training across multiple IQA datasets. With these designs, we develop the distribution-based Depicted image Quality Assessment model for Score regression (DeQA-Score). Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DeQA-Score stably outperforms baselines in score regression. Also, DeQA-Score can predict the score distribution that closely aligns with human annotations. Codes and model weights have been released in https://depictqa.github.io/deqa-score/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

While recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated impressive 2D image reasoning segmentation, adapting these capabilities to 3D scenes remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce MLLM-For3D, a simple yet effective framework that transfers knowledge from 2D MLLMs to 3D scene understanding. Specifically, we utilize MLLMs to generate multi-view pseudo segmentation masks and corresponding text embeddings, then unproject 2D masks into 3D space and align them with the text embeddings. The primary challenge lies in the absence of 3D context and spatial consistency across multiple views, causing the model to hallucinate objects that do not exist and fail to target objects consistently. Training the 3D model with such irrelevant objects leads to performance degradation. To address this, we introduce a spatial consistency strategy to enforce that segmentation masks remain coherent in the 3D space, effectively capturing the geometry of the scene. Moreover, we develop a Token-for-Query approach for multimodal semantic alignment, enabling consistent identification of the same object across different views. Extensive evaluations on various challenging indoor scene benchmarks demonstrate that, even without any labeled 3D training data, MLLM-For3D outperforms existing 3D reasoning segmentation methods, effectively interpreting user intent, understanding 3D scenes, and reasoning about spatial relationships.</p></details> |  |

The emergence of large-scale mobile location data (typically exemplified by GPS data), which captures people's movement over time at high spatiotemporal resolutions, offer a new approach to study this topic. This paper evaluates the potential and limitations of large-scale GPS data for food acquisition analysis through a case study. Using a high-resolution dataset of 286 million GPS records from individuals in Jacksonville, Florida, we conduct a case study to assess the strengths of GPS data in capturing spatiotemporal patterns of food outlet visits while also discussing key limitations, such as potential data biases and algorithmic uncertainties. Our findings confirm that GPS data can generate valuable insights about food acquisition behavior but may significantly underestimate visitation frequency to food outlets. Robustness checks highlight how algorithmic choices-especially regarding food outlet classification and visit identification-can influence research results. Our research underscores the value of GPS data in place-based health studies while emphasizing the need for careful consideration of data coverage, representativeness, algorithmic choices, and the broader implications of study findings.</p></details> |  |

However, the size of quantum circuits that can be run with high fidelity is constrained by the limited quantity and quality of physical qubits. Recently proposed schemes, such as wire cutting and qubit reuse, mitigate the problem but produce sub-optimal results as they address the problem individually. In addition, gate cutting, an alternative circuit-cutting strategy that is suitable for circuits computing expectation values, has not been fully explored in the field. In this paper, we propose QRCC, an integrated approach that exploits qubit reuse and circuit-cutting (including wire cutting and gate cutting) to run large circuits on small quantum computers. Circuit-cutting techniques introduce non-negligible post-processing overhead, which increases exponentially with the number of cuts. QRCC exploits qubit reuse to find better cutting solutions to minimize the cut numbers and thus the post-processing overhead. Our evaluation results show that on average we reduce the number of cuts by 29% and additional reduction when considering gate cuts.</p></details> |  |

It addresses a long-standing challenge in circuit design automation: automating netlist generation for analog circuits. Automating this workflow could accelerate the creation of fine-tuned LLMs for analog circuit design and verification. In this work, we identify key challenges in automated netlist generation and evaluate multimodal capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs, particularly GPT-4, in addressing them. We propose a three-step workflow to overcome existing limitations: labeling analog circuits, prompt tuning, and netlist verification. This approach enables end-to-end SPICE netlist generation from circuit schematic images, tackling the persistent challenge of accurate netlist generation. We utilize Masala-CHAI to collect a corpus of 7,500 schematics that span varying complexities in 10 textbooks and benchmark various open source and proprietary LLMs. Models fine-tuned on Masala-CHAI when used in LLM-agentic frameworks such as AnalogCoder achieve a notable 46% improvement in Pass@1 scores. We open-source our dataset and code for community-driven development.</p></details> |  |

Although adapter-based approaches (e.g., ControlNet) enable additional controls with minimal fine-tuning, they encounter challenges when integrating multiple conditions, including: branch conflicts between independently trained adapters, parameter redundancy leading to increased computational cost, and suboptimal performance compared to full fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we introduce FullDiT, a unified foundation model for video generation that seamlessly integrates multiple conditions via unified full-attention mechanisms. By fusing multi-task conditions into a unified sequence representation and leveraging the long-context learning ability of full self-attention to capture condition dynamics, FullDiT reduces parameter overhead, avoids conditions conflict, and shows scalability and emergent ability. We further introduce FullBench for multi-task video generation evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that FullDiT achieves state-of-the-art results, highlighting the efficacy of full-attention in complex multi-task video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fulldit.github.io/</p></details> |

However, interpreting these models' decisions has grown increasingly challenging. Existing interpretable attribution methods for object-level task interpretation have notable limitations: (1) gradient-based methods lack precise localization due to visual-textual fusion in foundation models, and (2) perturbation-based methods produce noisy saliency maps, limiting fine-grained interpretability. To address these, we propose a Visual Precision Search method that generates accurate attribution maps with fewer regions. Our method bypasses internal model parameters to overcome attribution issues from multimodal fusion, dividing inputs into sparse sub-regions and using consistency and collaboration scores to accurately identify critical decision-making regions. We also conducted a theoretical analysis of the boundary guarantees and scope of applicability of our method. Experiments on RefCOCO, MS COCO, and LVIS show our approach enhances object-level task interpretability over SOTA for Grounding DINO and Florence-2 across various evaluation metrics, with faithfulness gains of 23.7%, 31.6%, and 20.1% on MS COCO, LVIS, and RefCOCO for Grounding DINO, and 102.9% and 66.9% on MS COCO and RefCOCO for Florence-2. Additionally, our method can interpret failures in visual grounding and object detection tasks, surpassing existing methods across multiple evaluation metrics.

Traditional open-access datasets focusing on surgical procedures are often limited by their small size, typically consisting of fewer than 100 videos with less than 100K images. To address these constraints, a new dataset called Surg-3M has been compiled using a novel aggregation pipeline that collects high-resolution videos from online sources. Featuring an extensive collection of over 4K surgical videos and more than 3 million high-quality images from multiple procedure types, Surg-3M offers a comprehensive resource surpassing existing alternatives in size and scope, including two novel tasks. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this dataset, we present SurgFM, a self-supervised foundation model pretrained on Surg-3M that achieves impressive results in downstream tasks such as surgical phase recognition, action recognition, and tool presence detection. Combining key components from ConvNeXt, DINO, and an innovative augmented distillation method, SurgFM exhibits exceptional performance compared to specialist architectures across various benchmarks. Our experimental results show that SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in multiple downstream tasks, including significant gains in surgical phase recognition (+8.9pp, +4.7pp, and +3.9pp of Jaccard in AutoLaparo, M2CAI16, and Cholec80), action recognition (+3.1pp of mAP in CholecT50) and tool presence detection (+4.6pp of mAP in Cholec80). Moreover, even when using only half of the data, SurgFM outperforms state-of-the-art models in AutoLaparo and achieves state-of-the-art performance in Cholec80. Both Surg-3M and SurgFM have significant potential to accelerate progress towards developing autonomous robotic surgery systems.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Despite the promising performance, there are still several challenges. First, prior works have resorted to either vision-only or image-caption data, disregarding pathology reports with more clinically authentic information from pathologists and gene expression profiles which respectively offer distinct knowledge for versatile clinical applications. Second, the current progress in pathology FMs predominantly concentrates on the patch level, where the restricted context of patch-level pretraining fails to capture whole-slide patterns. Even recent slide-level FMs still struggle to provide whole-slide context for patch representation. In this study, for the first time, we develop a pathology foundation model incorporating three levels of modalities: pathology slides, pathology reports, and gene expression data, which resulted in 26,169 slide-level modality pairs from 10,275 patients across 32 cancer types, amounting to over 116 million pathological patch images. To leverage these data for CPath, we propose a novel whole-slide pretraining paradigm that injects the multimodal whole-slide context into the patch representation, called Multimodal Self-TAught PRetraining (mSTAR). The proposed paradigm revolutionizes the pretraining workflow for CPath, enabling the pathology FM to acquire the whole-slide context. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to incorporate three modalities at the whole-slide context for enhancing pathology FMs. To systematically evaluate the capabilities of mSTAR, we built the largest spectrum of oncological benchmark, spanning 7 categories of oncological applications in 15 types of 97 practical oncological tasks.</p></details> | 62 pages |

We propose a novel vision-language foundation model, LRSCLIP, and a multimodal dataset, LRS2M. The main contributions are as follows: (1) By integrating multi-source remote sensing data and adopting a large language model labeling strategy, we construct the LRS2M dataset, which contains 2 million image-text pairs, providing both short and long texts for the first time, thus solving the problem of semantic granularity limitations in existing datasets; (2) The design of the LRSCLIP architecture based on Long-CLIP's KPS module, which extends CLIP's text processing capacity and achieves fine-grained cross-modal feature alignment through a dual-text loss weighting mechanism. Experimental results show that LRSCLIP improves retrieval accuracy by 10\%-20\% over the Long-CLIP baseline in the zero-shot long-text cross-modal retrieval task. For the zero-shot short-text cross-modal retrieval task, LRSCLIP achieves improvements over the current best model, GeoRSCLIP, with increases of 0.17\%, 0.67\%, and 0.92\% in Text to Image R@1, Image to Text R@1, and mR on RSITMD, respectively, and 0.04\%, 2.93\%, and 1.28\% on RSICD. In the zero-shot image classification task (average accuracy=75.75\%) and semantic localization task (Rmi=0.7653), LRSCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance. These results validate the dual advantages of fine-grained semantic understanding and global feature matching in LRSCLIP. This work provides a new benchmark model and data support for remote sensing multimodal learning. The related code has been open source and is available at https://github.com/MitsuiChen14/LRSCLIP.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Foundations of the Theory of Performance-Based Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04227v3)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ranking entities such as algorithms, devices, methods, or models based on their performances, while accounting for application-specific preferences, is a challenge. To address this challenge, we establish the foundations of a universal theory for performance-based ranking. First, we introduce a rigorous framework built on top of both the probability and order theories. Our new framework encompasses the elements necessary to (1) manipulate performances as mathematical objects, (2) express which performances are worse than or equivalent to others, (3) model tasks through a variable called satisfaction, (4) consider properties of the evaluation, (5) define scores, and (6) specify application-specific preferences through a variable called importance. On top of this framework, we propose the first axiomatic definition of performance orderings and performance-based rankings. Then, we introduce a universal parametric family of scores, called ranking scores, that can be used to establish rankings satisfying our axioms, while considering application-specific preferences. Finally, we show, in the case of two-class classification, that the family of ranking scores encompasses well-known performance scores, including the accuracy, the true positive rate (recall, sensitivity), the true negative rate (specificity), the positive predictive value (precision), and F1. However, we also show that some other scores commonly used to compare classifiers are unsuitable to derive performance orderings satisfying the axioms.</p></details> |  |

The idea of a scientific foundation model (SciFM) is emerging as a promising tool for learning transferable representations across diverse domains. However, SciFMs require large amounts of solution data, which may be scarce or computationally expensive to generate. To maximize generalization while reducing data dependence, we propose incorporating PDE residuals into pre-training either as the sole learning signal or in combination with data loss to compensate for limited or infeasible training data. We evaluate this constraint-aware pre-training across three key benchmarks: (i) generalization to new physics, where material properties, e.g., the diffusion coefficient, is shifted with respect to the training distribution; (ii) generalization to entirely new PDEs, requiring adaptation to different operators; and (iii) robustness against noisy fine-tuning data, ensuring stability in real-world applications. Our results show that pre-training with PDE constraints significantly enhances generalization, outperforming models trained solely on solution data across all benchmarks. These findings prove the effectiveness of our proposed constraint-aware pre-training as a crucial component for SciFMs, providing a scalable approach to data-efficient, generalizable PDE solvers.</p></details> | pre-print, 31 pages |
| **[DINO in the Room: Leveraging 2D Foundation Models for 3D Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18944v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (VFMs) trained on large-scale image datasets provide high-quality features that have significantly advanced 2D visual recognition. However, their potential in 3D vision remains largely untapped, despite the common availability of 2D images alongside 3D point cloud datasets. While significant research has been dedicated to 2D-3D fusion, recent state-of-the-art 3D methods predominantly focus on 3D data, leaving the integration of VFMs into 3D models underexplored. In this work, we challenge this trend by introducing DITR, a simple yet effective approach that extracts 2D foundation model features, projects them to 3D, and finally injects them into a 3D point cloud segmentation model. DITR achieves state-of-the-art results on both indoor and outdoor 3D semantic segmentation benchmarks. To enable the use of VFMs even when images are unavailable during inference, we further propose to distill 2D foundation models into a 3D backbone as a pretraining task.

In this paper, we continually pre-train prevailing VFMs in a multimodal manner such that they can effortlessly process visual inputs of varying sizes and produce visual representations that are more aligned with language representations, regardless of their original pre-training process. To this end, we introduce CoMP, a carefully designed multimodal pre-training pipeline. CoMP uses a Continual Rotary Position Embedding to support native resolution continual pre-training, and an Alignment Loss between visual and textual features through language prototypes to align multimodal representations. By three-stage training, our VFMs achieve remarkable improvements not only in multimodal understanding but also in other downstream tasks such as classification and segmentation. Remarkably, CoMP-SigLIP achieves scores of 66.7 on ChartQA and 75.9 on DocVQA with a 0.5B LLM, while maintaining an 87.4% accuracy on ImageNet-1K and a 49.5 mIoU on ADE20K under frozen chunk evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available in https://github.com/SliMM-X/CoMP-MM</p></details> |

This makes it impossible to introduce implementation and optimization techniques that are provably correct and, in fact, has led to discrepancies between different implementations. Moreover, it precludes studying fundamental properties of different languages (e.g., expressive power). To address this gap, this paper introduces a language-agnostic algebra for capturing mapping definitions. As further contributions, we show that the popular mapping language RML can be translated into our algebra (by which we also provide a formal definition of the semantics of RML) and we prove several algebraic rewriting rules that can be used to optimize mapping plans based on our algebra.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a research paper accepted for the 22nd Extended Semantic Web Conference (ESWC 2025).

To address these challenges, we propose a foundation model for whole-heart segmentation using a self-supervised learning (SSL) framework based on a student-teacher architecture. Our model is pretrained on a large, unlabeled dataset of CT and MRI scans, leveraging the xLSTM backbone to capture long-range spatial dependencies and complex anatomical structures in 3D medical images. By incorporating multi-modal pretraining, our approach ensures strong generalization across both CT and MRI modalities, mitigating modality-specific variations and improving segmentation accuracy in diverse clinical settings. The use of large-scale unlabeled data significantly reduces the dependency on manual annotations, enabling robust performance even with limited labeled data. We further introduce an xLSTM-UNet-based architecture for downstream whole-heart segmentation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness on few-label CT and MRI datasets. Our results validate the robustness and adaptability of the proposed model, highlighting its potential for advancing automated whole-heart segmentation in medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the Road Ahead: A Knowledge Graph based Foundation Model for Scene Understanding in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18730v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The autonomous driving field has seen remarkable advancements in various topics, such as object recognition, trajectory prediction, and motion planning. However, current approaches face limitations in effectively comprehending the complex evolutions of driving scenes over time. This paper proposes FM4SU, a novel methodology for training a symbolic foundation model (FM) for scene understanding in autonomous driving. It leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to capture sensory observation along with domain knowledge such as road topology, traffic rules, or complex interactions between traffic participants. A bird's eye view (BEV) symbolic representation is extracted from the KG for each driving scene, including the spatio-temporal information among the objects across the scenes. The BEV representation is serialized into a sequence of tokens and given to pre-trained language models (PLMs) for learning an inherent understanding of the co-occurrence among driving scene elements and generating predictions on the next scenes. We conducted a number of experiments using the nuScenes dataset and KG in various scenarios. The results demonstrate that fine-tuned models achieve significantly higher accuracy in all tasks. The fine-tuned T5 model achieved a next scene prediction accuracy of 86.7%. This paper concludes that FM4SU offers a promising foundation for developing more comprehensive models for scene understanding in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Automatic Data Curation for Vision Foundation Models in Digital Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18709v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models (FMs) are accelerating the development of digital pathology algorithms and transforming biomedical research. These models learn, in a self-supervised manner, to represent histological features in highly heterogeneous tiles extracted from whole-slide images (WSIs) of real-world patient samples. The performance of these FMs is significantly influenced by the size, diversity, and balance of the pre-training data. However, data selection has been primarily guided by expert knowledge at the WSI level, focusing on factors such as disease classification and tissue types, while largely overlooking the granular details available at the tile level. In this paper, we investigate the potential of unsupervised automatic data curation at the tile-level, taking into account 350 million tiles. Specifically, we apply hierarchical clustering trees to pre-extracted tile embeddings, allowing us to sample balanced datasets uniformly across the embedding space of the pretrained FM. We further identify these datasets are subject to a trade-off between size and balance, potentially compromising the quality of representations learned by FMs, and propose tailored batch sampling strategies to mitigate this effect. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through improved performance on a diverse range of clinically relevant downstream tasks.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[OCRT: Boosting Foundation Models in the Open World with Object-Concept-Relation Triad](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18695v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although foundation models (FMs) claim to be powerful, their generalization ability significantly decreases when faced with distribution shifts, weak supervision, or malicious attacks in the open world. On the other hand, most domain generalization or adversarial fine-tuning methods are task-related or model-specific, ignoring the universality in practical applications and the transferability between FMs. This paper delves into the problem of generalizing FMs to the out-of-domain data. We propose a novel framework, the Object-Concept-Relation Triad (OCRT), that enables FMs to extract sparse, high-level concepts and intricate relational structures from raw visual inputs. The key idea is to bind objects in visual scenes and a set of object-centric representations through unsupervised decoupling and iterative refinement. To be specific, we project the object-centric representations onto a semantic concept space that the model can readily interpret and estimate their importance to filter out irrelevant elements. Then, a concept-based graph, which has a flexible degree, is constructed to incorporate the set of concepts and their corresponding importance, enabling the extraction of high-order factors from informative concepts and facilitating relational reasoning among these concepts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCRT can substantially boost the generalizability and robustness of SAM and CLIP across multiple downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

With the success of visual foundation models (VFMs) in the image domain, leveraging 2D priors to address 3D online segmentation has become a prominent research focus. Since segmentation results provided by 2D priors often require spatial consistency to be lifted into final 3D segmentation, an efficient method for identifying spatial overlap among 2D masks is essential - yet existing methods rarely achieve this in real time, mainly limiting its use to offline approaches. To address this, we propose an efficient method that lifts 2D masks generated by VFMs into a unified 3D instance using a hashing technique. By employing voxel hashing for efficient 3D scene querying, our approach reduces the time complexity of costly spatial overlap queries from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$. Accurate spatial associations further enable 3D merging of 2D masks through simple similarity-based filtering in a zero-shot manner, making our approach more robust to incomplete and noisy data. Evaluated on the ScanNet and SceneNN benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in online, open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation with leading efficiency.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce GaussTR, a novel Gaussian-based Transformer framework that unifies sparse 3D modeling with foundation model alignment through Gaussian representations to advance 3D spatial understanding. GaussTR predicts sparse sets of Gaussians in a feed-forward manner to represent 3D scenes. By splatting the Gaussians into 2D views and aligning the rendered features with foundation models, GaussTR facilitates self-supervised 3D representation learning and enables open-vocabulary semantic occupancy prediction without requiring explicit annotations. Empirical experiments on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset demonstrate GaussTR's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance of 12.27 mIoU, along with a 40% reduction in training time. These results highlight the efficacy of GaussTR for scalable and holistic 3D spatial understanding, with promising implications in autonomous driving and embodied agents.

Unlike prior methods that focus solely on preserving facial identity, our approach captures detailed full-body appearance, aligning with text descriptions for body structure and scene variations. Training this model requires large-scale paired human data, consisting of multiple images per individual with consistent full-body identities, which is notoriously difficult to obtain. To address this, we propose a data curation pipeline leveraging vision-language models to evaluate full-body appearance consistency, resulting in Visual Persona-500K, a dataset of 580k paired human images across 100k unique identities. For precise appearance transfer, we introduce a transformer encoder-decoder architecture adapted to a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, which augments the input image into distinct body regions, encodes these regions as local appearance features, and projects them into dense identity embeddings independently to condition the diffusion model for synthesizing customized images. Visual Persona consistently surpasses existing approaches, generating high-quality, customized images from in-the-wild inputs. Extensive ablation studies validate design choices, and we demonstrate the versatility of Visual Persona across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025, Project page is available at https://cvlab-kaist.github.io/Visual-Persona</p></details> |

However, most approaches focus on detecting local structural anomalies while neglecting compositional anomalies incorporating logical constraints. In this paper, we introduce LogSAD, a novel multi-modal framework that requires no training for both Logical and Structural Anomaly Detection. First, we propose a match-of-thought architecture that employs advanced large multi-modal models (i.e. GPT-4V) to generate matching proposals, formulating interests and compositional rules of thought for anomaly detection. Second, we elaborate on multi-granularity anomaly detection, consisting of patch tokens, sets of interests, and composition matching with vision and language foundation models. Subsequently, we present a calibration module to align anomaly scores from different detectors, followed by integration strategies for the final decision. Consequently, our approach addresses both logical and structural anomaly detection within a unified framework and achieves state-of-the-art results without the need for training, even when compared to supervised approaches, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness.

Despite recent advancements in LVFMs, such as DINOv2 and CLIP, their potential in knowledge distillation for enhancing edge models remains underexplored. While knowledge distillation is a promising approach for improving the performance of edge models, the discrepancy in model capacities and heterogeneous architectures between LVFMs and edge models poses a significant challenge. Our observation indicates that although utilizing larger backbones (e.g., ViT-S to ViT-L) in teacher models improves their downstream task performances, the knowledge distillation from the large teacher models fails to bring as much performance gain for student models as for teacher models due to the large model discrepancy. Our simple yet effective CustomKD customizes the well-generalized features inherent in LVFMs to a given student model in order to reduce model discrepancies. Specifically, beyond providing well-generalized original knowledge from teachers, CustomKD aligns the features of teachers to those of students, making it easy for students to understand and overcome the large model discrepancy overall. CustomKD significantly improves the performances of edge models in scenarios with unlabeled data such as unsupervised domain adaptation (e.g., OfficeHome and DomainNet) and semi-supervised learning (e.g., CIFAR-100 with 400 labeled samples and ImageNet with 1% labeled samples), achieving the new state-of-the-art performances.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, our systematic evaluation across various model families (DeepSeek, Qwen, and LLaMA) and scales (7B to 671B) reveals that acquiring these deliberative reasoning capabilities significantly reduces the foundational capabilities of LRMs, including notable declines in helpfulness and harmlessness, alongside substantially increased inference costs. Importantly, we demonstrate that adaptive reasoning -- employing modes like Zero-Thinking, Less-Thinking, and Summary-Thinking -- can effectively alleviate these drawbacks.

Existing approaches either selectively fine-tune parameters or freeze the VFMs and update only the adapters, both of which may underutilize the VFMs' full potential in DGSS tasks. We observe that domain-sensitive parameters in VFMs, arising from task and distribution differences, can hinder generalization. To address this, we propose \textbf{FisherTune}, a robust fine-tuning method guided by the Domain-Related Fisher Information Matrix (DR-FIM). DR-FIM measures parameter sensitivity across tasks and domains, enabling selective updates that preserve generalization and enhance DGSS adaptability. FisherTune incorporates variational inference to stabilize DR-FIM estimation, treating parameters as Gaussian-distributed variables and leveraging pre-trained priors. Extensive experiments show that FisherTune achieves superior cross-domain segmentation while maintaining generalization, outperforming selective-parameter and adapter-based methods.</p></details> |  |

This approach leads to slide representations highly tailored to a specific clinical task. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.4% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

Existing approaches struggle with such alignment issues, often resulting in misalignment and penetration artifacts. To tackle this, we propose a novel framework that attempts to precisely align hand poses and interactions by synergistically integrating foundation model-driven 2D priors with diffusion-based interaction refinement for occlusion-resistant two-hand reconstruction. First, we introduce a Fusion Alignment Encoder that learns to align fused multimodal priors keypoints, segmentation maps, and depth cues from foundation models during training. This provides robust structured guidance, further enabling efficient inference without foundation models at test time while maintaining high reconstruction accuracy. Second, we employ a two-hand diffusion model explicitly trained to transform interpenetrated poses into plausible, non-penetrated interactions, leveraging gradient-guided denoising to correct artifacts and ensure realistic spatial relations. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on InterHand2.6M, FreiHAND, and HIC datasets, significantly advancing occlusion handling and interaction robustness.</p></details> |  |

Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.</p></details> |  |

Advances in computing, data availability, and self-supervised learning (SSL) have paved the way for slide-level foundation models (SLFMs) that can improve prediction tasks in low-data regimes. However, working with these models is challenging, with issues such as catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning and under-utilization of shared information between tasks and modalities. To overcome these two challenges, we propose ModalTune, a novel fine-tuning framework which introduces the Modal Adapter to integrate new modalities without modifying SLFM weights. Additionally, we use large-language models (LLMs) to encode labels as text, capturing semantic relationships and enhancing generalization across multiple tasks and cancer types in a single training recipe. ModalTune achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results against both uni-modal and multi-modal models across four cancer types, jointly improving survival and cancer subtype prediction while remaining competitive in pan-cancer settings. Additionally, we show ModalTune is highly generalizable to two out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first unified fine-tuning framework for multi-modal, multi-task, and pan-cancer modeling in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

This research introduces `continual unlearning', a novel paradigm that enables the targeted removal of multiple specific concepts from foundational generative models, incrementally. We propose Decremental Unlearning without Generalization Erosion (DUGE) algorithm which selectively unlearns the generation of undesired concepts while preserving the generation of related, non-targeted concepts and alleviating generalization erosion. For this, DUGE targets three losses: a cross-attention loss that steers the focus towards images devoid of the target concept; a prior-preservation loss that safeguards knowledge related to non-target concepts; and a regularization loss that prevents the model from suffering from generalization erosion. Experimental results demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to exclude certain concepts without compromising the overall integrity and performance of the model. This offers a pragmatic solution for refining generative models, adeptly handling the intricacies of model training and concept management lowering the risks of copyright infringement, personal or licensed material misuse, and replication of distinctive artistic styles. Importantly, it maintains the non-targeted concepts, thereby safeguarding the model's core capabilities and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to T-PAMI</p></details> |

This paper advocates for integrating causal methods into machine learning to navigate the trade-offs among key principles of trustworthy ML, including fairness, privacy, robustness, accuracy, and explainability. While these objectives should ideally be satisfied simultaneously, they are often addressed in isolation, leading to conflicts and suboptimal solutions. Drawing on existing applications of causality in ML that successfully align goals such as fairness and accuracy or privacy and robustness, this paper argues that a causal approach is essential for balancing multiple competing objectives in both trustworthy ML and foundation models. Beyond highlighting these trade-offs, we examine how causality can be practically integrated into ML and foundation models, offering solutions to enhance their reliability and interpretability. Finally, we discuss the challenges, limitations, and opportunities in adopting causal frameworks, paving the way for more accountable and ethically sound AI systems.</p></details> |  |

However, the extensive prior knowledge inherent in these models can sometimes be a double-edged sword when adapting them to downstream tasks in specific domains. In the context of semi-supervised medical image segmentation with domain shift, foundation models like MedSAM tend to make overconfident predictions, some of which are incorrect. The error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements. In this paper, we introduce a Synergistic training framework for Foundation and Conventional models (SynFoC) to address the issue. We observe that a conventional model trained from scratch has the ability to correct the high-confidence mispredictions of the foundation model, while the foundation model can supervise it with high-quality pseudo-labels in the early training stages. Furthermore, to enhance the collaborative training effectiveness of both models and promote reliable convergence towards optimization, the consensus-divergence consistency regularization is proposed. We demonstrate the superiority of our method across four public multi-domain datasets. In particular, our method improves the Dice score by 10.31\% on the Prostate dataset.

However, sparse depth annotations from sensors limit the availability of dense supervision, which is necessary for learning detailed geometric features. In this paper, we propose a two-stage knowledge distillation framework that leverages powerful monocular foundation models to provide dense supervision for depth completion. In the first stage, we introduce a pre-training strategy that generates diverse training data from natural images, which distills geometric knowledge to depth completion. Specifically, we simulate LiDAR scans by utilizing monocular depth and mesh reconstruction, thereby creating training data without requiring ground-truth depth. Besides, monocular depth estimation suffers from inherent scale ambiguity in real-world settings. To address this, in the second stage, we employ a scale- and shift-invariant loss (SSI Loss) to learn real-world scales when fine-tuning on real-world datasets. Our two-stage distillation framework enables depth completion models to harness the strengths of monocular foundation models. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained with our two-stage distillation framework achieve state-of-the-art performance, ranking \textbf{first place} on the KITTI benchmark.

This work evaluates the ability of these models to predict disease progression using a simple linear probe. We hypothesize that intermediate layer features of segmentation models capture structural information, while those of registration models encode knowledge of change over time. Beyond demonstrating that these features are useful for disease progression prediction, we also show that registration model features do not require spatially aligned input images. However, for segmentation models, spatial alignment is essential for optimal performance. Our findings highlight the importance of spatial alignment and the utility of foundation model features for image registration.</p></details> |  |

Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

Prevalent multimodal pre-training approaches in MLLM construction focus on enhancing perception by training on high-quality image captions. While leveraging advanced MLLMs for caption generation enhances scalability, their outputs often lack comprehensiveness and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce Self-Improving cognition (SIcog), a self-learning framework designed to construct next-generation foundation MLLMs by enhancing their systematic cognitive capabilities through multimodal pre-training with self-generated data. Specifically, we propose Chain-of-Description (CoD), an approach that improves an MLLM's systematic perception by enabling step-by-step visual understanding. CoD sequentially focuses on salient content, fine-grained details, relational attributes, and peripheral context, before generating a coherent description, ensuring greater accuracy and comprehensiveness. Additionally, we adopt a structured chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning technique to enable MLLMs to integrate in-depth multimodal reasoning. To construct a next-generation foundation MLLM with self-improved cognition, SIcog first equips an MLLM with systematic perception and reasoning abilities using minimal external annotations. The enhanced models then generate detailed captions and CoT reasoning data, which are further curated through self-consistency. This curated data is ultimately used for multimodal pre-training to develop next-generation foundation models. Extensive experiments on both low- and high-resolution MLLMs across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that, SIcog produces next-generation foundation MLLMs with significantly improved cognition, achieving benchmark-leading performance compared to prevalent pre-training approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages.

| **[GAIR: Improving Multimodal Geo-Foundation Model with Geo-Aligned Implicit Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16683v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in vision and language foundation models have inspired the development of geo-foundation models (GeoFMs), enhancing performance across diverse geospatial tasks. However, many existing GeoFMs primarily focus on overhead remote sensing (RS) data while neglecting other data modalities such as ground-level imagery. A key challenge in multimodal GeoFM development is to explicitly model geospatial relationships across modalities, which enables generalizability across tasks, spatial scales, and temporal contexts. To address these limitations, we propose GAIR, a novel multimodal GeoFM architecture integrating overhead RS data, street view (SV) imagery, and their geolocation metadata. We utilize three factorized neural encoders to project an SV image, its geolocation, and an RS image into the embedding space. The SV image needs to be located within the RS image's spatial footprint but does not need to be at its geographic center. In order to geographically align the SV image and RS image, we propose a novel implicit neural representations (INR) module that learns a continuous RS image representation and looks up the RS embedding at the SV image's geolocation. Next, these geographically aligned SV embedding, RS embedding, and location embedding are trained with contrastive learning objectives from unlabeled data. We evaluate GAIR across 10 geospatial tasks spanning RS image-based, SV image-based, and location embedding-based benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that GAIR outperforms state-of-the-art GeoFMs and other strong baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in learning generalizable and transferable geospatial representations.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[A preliminary data fusion study to assess the feasibility of Foundation Process-Property Models in Laser Powder Bed Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16667v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are at the forefront of an increasing number of critical applications. In regards to technologies such as additive manufacturing (AM), these models have the potential to dramatically accelerate process optimization and, in turn, design of next generation materials. A major challenge that impedes the construction of foundation process-property models is data scarcity. To understand the impact of this challenge, and since foundation models rely on data fusion, in this work we conduct controlled experiments where we focus on the transferability of information across different material systems and properties. More specifically, we generate experimental datasets from 17-4 PH and 316L stainless steels (SSs) in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) where we measure the effect of five process parameters on porosity and hardness. We then leverage Gaussian processes (GPs) for process-property modeling in various configurations to test if knowledge about one material system or property can be leveraged to build more accurate machine learning models for other material systems or properties. Through extensive cross-validation studies and probing the GPs' interpretable hyperparameters, we study the intricate relation among data size and dimensionality, complexity of the process-property relations, noise, and characteristics of machine learning models. Our findings highlight the need for structured learning approaches that incorporate domain knowledge in building foundation process-property models rather than relying on uninformed data fusion in data-limited applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynamicVis: An Efficient and General Visual Foundation Model for Remote Sensing Image Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16426v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of remote sensing technology has improved the spatial resolution of satellite imagery, facilitating more detailed visual representations for diverse interpretations. However, existing methods exhibit limited generalization capabilities across varied applications. While some contemporary foundation models demonstrate potential, they are hindered by insufficient cross-task adaptability and primarily process low-resolution imagery of restricted sizes, thus failing to fully exploit high-resolution data or leverage comprehensive large-scene semantics. Crucially, remote sensing imagery differs fundamentally from natural images, as key foreground targets (eg., maritime objects, artificial structures) often occupy minimal spatial proportions (~1%) and exhibit sparse distributions. Efficiently modeling cross-task generalizable knowledge from lengthy 2D tokens (~100,000) poses a significant challenge yet remains critical for remote sensing image understanding. Motivated by the selective attention mechanisms inherent to the human visual system, we propose DynamicVis, a dynamic visual perception foundation model for remote sensing imagery. The framework integrates a novel dynamic region perception backbone based on the selective state space model, which strategically balances localized detail extraction with global contextual integration, enabling computationally efficient encoding of large-scale data while maintaining architectural scalability. To enhance cross-task knowledge transferring, we introduce a multi-instance learning paradigm utilizing meta-embedding representations, trained on million-scale region-level annotations. Evaluations across nine downstream tasks demonstrate the model's versatility. DynamicVis achieves multi-level feature modeling with exceptional efficiency, processing (2048x2048) pixels with 97 ms latency (6% of ViT's) and 833 MB GPU memory (3% of ViT's).</p></details> |  |

While early developments centered on uni-modal models trained solely on visual data, recent advances have highlighted the promise of multi-modal foundation models that integrate heterogeneous data sources such as textual reports, structured domain knowledge, and molecular profiles. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive and up-to-date review of multi-modal foundation models in CPath, with a particular focus on models built upon hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained whole slide images (WSIs) and tile-level representations. We categorize 32 state-of-the-art multi-modal foundation models into three major paradigms: vision-language, vision-knowledge graph, and vision-gene expression. We further divide vision-language models into non-LLM-based and LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we analyze 28 available multi-modal datasets tailored for pathology, grouped into image-text pairs, instruction datasets, and image-other modality pairs. Our survey also presents a taxonomy of downstream tasks, highlights training and evaluation strategies, and identifies key challenges and future directions. We aim for this survey to serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working at the intersection of pathology and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2Earth: Unlocking Text-driven Remote Sensing Image Generation with a Global-Scale Dataset and a Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00895v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative foundation models have advanced large-scale text-driven natural image generation, becoming a prominent research trend across various vertical domains. However, in the remote sensing field, there is still a lack of research on large-scale text-to-image (text2image) generation technology. Existing remote sensing image-text datasets are small in scale and confined to specific geographic areas and scene types. Besides, existing text2image methods have struggled to achieve global-scale, multi-resolution controllable, and unbounded image generation. To address these challenges, this paper presents two key contributions: the Git-10M dataset and the Text2Earth foundation model. Git-10M is a global-scale image-text dataset comprising 10.5 million image-text pairs, 5 times larger than the previous largest one. The dataset covers a wide range of geographic scenes and contains resolution information, significantly surpassing existing datasets in both size and diversity. Building on Git-10M, we propose Text2Earth, a 1.3 billion parameter generative foundation model based on the diffusion framework to model global-scale remote sensing scenes. Text2Earth integrates a resolution guidance mechanism, enabling users to specify image resolutions. A dynamic condition adaptation strategy is proposed for training and inference to improve image quality. Text2Earth excels in zero-shot text2image generation and demonstrates robust generalization and flexibility across multiple tasks, including unbounded scene construction, image editing, and cross-modal image generation. This robust capability surpasses previous models restricted to the basic fixed size and limited scene types. On the previous benchmark dataset, Text2Earth outperforms previous models with an improvement of +26.23 FID and +20.95% Zero-shot Cls-OA metric.Our project page is https://chen-yang-liu.github.io/Text2Earth</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroLM: A Universal Multi-task Foundation Model for Bridging the Gap between Language and EEG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00101v3)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Efficiently Adapt Foundation Models for Self-Supervised Endoscopic 3D Scene Reconstruction from Any Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15917v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D scene reconstruction is essential for numerous medical tasks. Given the challenges in obtaining ground truth data, there has been an increasing focus on self-supervised learning (SSL) for endoscopic depth estimation as a basis for scene reconstruction. While foundation models have shown remarkable progress in visual tasks, their direct application to the medical domain often leads to suboptimal results. However, the visual features from these models can still enhance endoscopic tasks, emphasizing the need for efficient adaptation strategies, which still lack exploration currently. In this paper, we introduce Endo3DAC, a unified framework for endoscopic scene reconstruction that efficiently adapts foundation models. We design an integrated network capable of simultaneously estimating depth maps, relative poses, and camera intrinsic parameters. By freezing the backbone foundation model and training only the specially designed Gated Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (GDV-LoRA) with separate decoder heads, Endo3DAC achieves superior depth and pose estimation while maintaining training efficiency. Additionally, we propose a 3D scene reconstruction pipeline that optimizes depth maps' scales, shifts, and a few parameters based on our integrated network. Extensive experiments across four endoscopic datasets demonstrate that Endo3DAC significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods while requiring fewer trainable parameters. To our knowledge, we are the first to utilize a single network that only requires surgical videos to perform both SSL depth estimation and scene reconstruction tasks. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gene42: Long-Range Genomic Foundation Model With Dense Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16565v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Gene42, a novel family of Genomic Foundation Models (GFMs) designed to manage context lengths of up to 192,000 base pairs (bp) at a single-nucleotide resolution. Gene42 models utilize a decoder-only (LLaMA-style) architecture with a dense self-attention mechanism. Initially trained on fixed-length sequences of 4,096 bp, our models underwent continuous pretraining to extend the context length to 192,000 bp. This iterative extension allowed for the comprehensive processing of large-scale genomic data and the capture of intricate patterns and dependencies within the human genome. Gene42 is the first dense attention model capable of handling such extensive long context lengths in genomics, challenging state-space models that often rely on convolutional operators among other mechanisms. Our pretrained models exhibit notably low perplexity values and high reconstruction accuracy, highlighting their strong ability to model genomic data. Extensive experiments on various genomic benchmarks have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance across multiple tasks, including biotype classification, regulatory region identification, chromatin profiling prediction, variant pathogenicity prediction, and species classification. The models are publicly available at huggingface.co/inceptionai.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIMB: Data Foundations for Large Scale Multimodal Clinical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07667v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in clinical AI have enabled remarkable progress across many clinical domains. However, existing benchmarks and models are primarily limited to a small set of modalities and tasks, which hinders the development of large-scale multimodal methods that can make holistic assessments of patient health and well-being. To bridge this gap, we introduce Clinical Large-Scale Integrative Multimodal Benchmark (CLIMB), a comprehensive clinical benchmark unifying diverse clinical data across imaging, language, temporal, and graph modalities. CLIMB comprises 4.51 million patient samples totaling 19.01 terabytes distributed across 2D imaging, 3D video, time series, graphs, and multimodal data. Through extensive empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that multitask pretraining significantly improves performance on understudied domains, achieving up to 29% improvement in ultrasound and 23% in ECG analysis over single-task learning. Pretraining on CLIMB also effectively improves models' generalization capability to new tasks, and strong unimodal encoder performance translates well to multimodal performance when paired with task-appropriate fusion strategies. Our findings provide a foundation for new architecture designs and pretraining strategies to advance clinical AI research. Code is released at https://github.com/DDVD233/climb.</p></details> |  |

While VLFMs show a rich understanding of semantic content across modalities, they often struggle with fine-grained alignment tasks that require precise correspondence between image regions and textual descriptions a limitation in medical imaging, where accurate localization and detection of clinical features are essential for diagnosis and analysis. To address this issue, we propose a multi-stage architecture where a pre-trained VLFM provides a cursory semantic understanding, while a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm refines the alignment through an iterative process that optimizes for understanding semantic context. The reward signal is designed to align the semantic information of the text with synthesized images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a medical imaging skin dataset where the generated images exhibit improved generation quality and alignment with prompt over the fine-tuned Stable Diffusion. We also show that the synthesized samples could be used to improve disease classifier performance for underrepresented subgroups through augmentation.</p></details> |  |

Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under revision at IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

Current studies on LLMs have shown immense potential in applying LLMs to model individual mobility prediction problems. However, most LLM-based mobility prediction models only train on specific datasets or use single well-designed prompts, leading to difficulty in adapting to different cities and users with diverse contexts. To fill these gaps, this paper proposes a unified fine-tuning framework to train a foundational open source LLM-based mobility prediction model. We conducted extensive experiments on six real-world mobility datasets to validate the proposed model. The results showed that the proposed model achieved the best performance in prediction accuracy and transferability over state-of-the-art models based on deep learning and LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While significant advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series from electronic health records, the potential of FMs for patient behavior monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. These datasets are inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel FM based on a modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. We demonstrate that our pretrained FM, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients, performs downstream tasks via its latent representation without fine-tuning on a held-out cohort of suicidal patients. To illustrate this, we develop a probabilistic change-point detection algorithm for suicide detection and demonstrate the FM's effectiveness in predicting emotional states. Our results show that the discrete latent structure of the VQ-VAE outperforms a state-of-the-art Informer architecture in unsupervised suicide detection, while matching its performance in supervised emotion prediction when the latent dimensionality is increased, though at the cost of reduced unsupervised accuracy. This trade-off highlights the need for future FMs to integrate hybrid discrete-continuous structures for balanced performance across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (31 with appendices), 6 figures (13 with appendices); submitted to UAI 2025</p></details> |

I leveraged the unique opportunity presented by an upcoming publication describing a novel catastrophic biothreat - "Technical Report on Mirror Bacteria: Feasibility and Risks" - to conduct a small controlled study before it became public. Graduate-trained biologists tasked with predicting the consequences of releasing mirror E. coli showed no significant differences in rubric-graded accuracy using Claude Sonnet 3.5 new (n=10) or web search only (n=2); both groups scored comparably to a web baseline (28 and 43 versus 36). However, Sonnet reasoned correctly when prompted by a report author, but a smaller model, Haiku 3.5, failed even with author guidance (80 versus 5). These results suggest distinct stages of model capability: Haiku is unable to reason about mirror life even with threat-aware expert guidance (Stage 1), while Sonnet correctly reasons only with threat-aware prompting (Stage 2). Continued advances may allow future models to disclose novel CBRN threats to naive experts (Stage 3) or unskilled users (Stage 4). While mirror life represents only one case study, monitoring new models' ability to reason about privately known threats may allow protective measures to be implemented before widespread disclosure.</p></details> | 26 pages, 2 figures |

However, several studies have revealed vulnerabilities in these models, such as generating unsafe content by text-to-image models. Existing benchmarks on multimodal models either predominantly assess the helpfulness of these models, or only focus on limited perspectives such as fairness and privacy. In this paper, we present the first unified platform, MMDT (Multimodal DecodingTrust), designed to provide a comprehensive safety and trustworthiness evaluation for MMFMs. Our platform assesses models from multiple perspectives, including safety, hallucination, fairness/bias, privacy, adversarial robustness, and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. We have designed various evaluation scenarios and red teaming algorithms under different tasks for each perspective to generate challenging data, forming a high-quality benchmark. We evaluate a range of multimodal models using MMDT, and our findings reveal a series of vulnerabilities and areas for improvement across these perspectives.

Recent advancements in humanoid robots have shown great promise as a hardware platform for building generalist autonomy in the human world. A robot foundation model, trained on massive and diverse data sources, is essential for enabling the robots to reason about novel situations, robustly handle real-world variability, and rapidly learn new tasks.

However, existing segmentation models often struggle with generalizability across imaging modalities, and anatomical variations. In this work, we propose RoMedFormer, a rotary-embedding transformer-based foundation model designed for 3D female genito-pelvic structure segmentation in both MRI and CT. RoMedFormer leverages self-supervised learning and rotary positional embeddings to enhance spatial feature representation and capture long-range dependencies in 3D medical data.

Through systematic analysis, we uncover two fundamental limitations: Stable Diffusion (SD) struggles to extract meaningful features from abstract sketches (unlike its success with photos), and exhibits a pronounced frequency-domain bias that suppresses essential low-frequency components needed for sketch understanding. Rather than costly retraining, we address these limitations by strategically combining SD with CLIP, whose strong semantic understanding naturally compensates for SD's spatial-frequency biases. By dynamically injecting CLIP features into SD's denoising process and adaptively aggregating features across semantic levels, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in sketch retrieval (+3.35%), recognition (+1.06%), segmentation (+29.42%), and correspondence learning (+21.22%), demonstrating the first truly universal sketch feature representation in the era of foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPR 2025.

Despite recent advancements in foundation model adaptation to monocular depth estimation of endoscopic scenes via self-supervised learning (SSL), no prior work has explored their use for pose estimation. These methods rely on low rank-based adaptation approaches, which constrain model updates to a low-rank space. We propose Endo-FASt3r, the first monocular SSL depth and pose estimation framework that uses foundation models for both tasks. We extend the Reloc3r relative pose estimation foundation model by designing Reloc3rX, introducing modifications necessary for convergence in SSL. We also present DoMoRA, a novel adaptation technique that enables higher-rank updates and faster convergence. Experiments on the SCARED dataset show that Endo-FASt3r achieves a substantial $10\%$ improvement in pose estimation and a $2\%$ improvement in depth estimation over prior work. Similar performance gains on the Hamlyn and StereoMIS datasets reinforce the generalisability of Endo-FASt3r across different datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Feature-Driven Online End-Effector Pose Estimation: A Marker-Free and Learning-Free Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14051v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate transformation estimation between camera space and robot space is essential. Traditional methods using markers for hand-eye calibration require offline image collection, limiting their suitability for online self-calibration. Recent learning-based robot pose estimation methods, while advancing online calibration, struggle with cross-robot generalization and require the robot to be fully visible. This work proposes a Foundation feature-driven online End-Effector Pose Estimation (FEEPE) algorithm, characterized by its training-free and cross end-effector generalization capabilities. Inspired by the zero-shot generalization capabilities of foundation models, FEEPE leverages pre-trained visual features to estimate 2D-3D correspondences derived from the CAD model and target image, enabling 6D pose estimation via the PnP algorithm. To resolve ambiguities from partial observations and symmetry, a multi-historical key frame enhanced pose optimization algorithm is introduced, utilizing temporal information for improved accuracy. Compared to traditional hand-eye calibration, FEEPE enables marker-free online calibration. Unlike robot pose estimation, it generalizes across robots and end-effectors in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superior flexibility, generalization, and performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditionally, these connections have been focusing mostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve important theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has proposed the entropic quantum gravity approach that proposes an action for gravity given by the quantum relative entropy between the metrics associated to a manifold. Here it is demonstrated that the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient flow of the entropic quantum gravity action. These results provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the Perona-Malik algorithm and open new avenues for establishing fundamental relations between brain research, machine learning and entropic quantum gravity.</p></details> | (7 pages, 1 figure) |
| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v3)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional modules to capture temporal information. Although the additional modules increase the capacity of model, enabling it to better capture video-specific inductive biases, existing methods typically introduce a substantial number of new parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a parameter-efficient Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to enhance the alignment between textual and visual representations, achieving a balance between generalizable knowledge and task-specific adaptation. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint.This constraint involves providing template inputs (e.g., "a video of \{\textbf{cls}\}") to the trainable language branch and LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions to the pre-trained language branch, enforcing output consistency between the branches. This approach reduces overfitting to downstream tasks and enhances the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Scalable Foundation Model for Multi-modal and Hyperspectral Geospatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12843v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial raster data, such as that collected by satellite-based imaging systems at different times and spectral bands, hold immense potential for enabling a wide range of high-impact applications. This potential stems from the rich information that is spatially and temporally contextualized across multiple channels and sensing modalities. Recent work has adapted existing self-supervised learning approaches for such geospatial data. However, they fall short of scalable model architectures, leading to inflexibility and computational inefficiencies when faced with an increasing number of channels and modalities. To address these limitations, we introduce Low-rank Efficient Spatial-Spectral Vision Transformer with three key innovations: i) the LESS Attention Block that approximates high-dimensional spatial-spectral attention through Kronecker's product of the low-dimensional spatial and spectral attention components; ii) the Continuous Positional-Channel Embedding Layer that preserves both the continuity and physical characteristics of each spatial-spectral patch; and iii) the Perception Field Mask that exploits local spatial dependencies by constraining attention to neighboring patches. To evaluate the proposed innovations, we construct GFM-Bench, which serves as a comprehensive benchmark for such geospatial raster data. We pretrain LESS ViT using a Hyperspectral Masked Autoencoder framework with integrated positional and channel masking strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves competitive performance against state-of-the-art multi-modal geospatial foundation models while outperforming them on cross-satellite generalization tasks with higher computational efficiency. The flexibility and extensibility of our framework make it a promising direction for future geospatial data analysis tasks that involve a wide range of modalities and channels.</p></details> |  |

However, heterogeneity of electrocardiogram formats, limited access to deep learning model weights and intricate algorithmic steps for effective fine-tuning for own disease target labels result in complex workflows. In this work, we introduce ExChanGeAI, a web-based end-to-end platform that streamlines the reading of different formats, pre-processing, visualization and custom machine learning with local and privacy-preserving fine-tuning. ExChanGeAI is adaptable for use on both personal computers and scalable to high performance server environments. The platform offers state-of-the-art deep learning models for training from scratch, alongside our novel open-source electrocardiogram foundation model CardX, pre-trained on over one million electrocardiograms. Evaluation across three external validation sets, including an entirely new testset extracted from routine care, demonstrate the fine-tuning capabilities of ExChanGeAI. CardX outperformed the benchmark foundation model while requiring significantly fewer parameters and lower computational resources. The platform enables users to empirically determine the most suitable model for their specific tasks based on systematic validations.The code is available at https://imigitlab.uni-muenster.de/published/exchangeai .</p></details> |  |

A Holistic Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12990v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLMs) have gained popularity due to their enhanced performance and generalizability across different downstream tasks. However, most existing histopathology benchmarks are either unimodal or limited in terms of diversity of clinical tasks, organs, and acquisition instruments, as well as their partial availability to the public due to patient data privacy. As a consequence, there is a lack of comprehensive evaluation of existing histopathology VLMs on a unified benchmark setting that better reflects a wide range of clinical scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce HistoVL, a fully open-source comprehensive benchmark comprising images acquired using up to 11 various acquisition tools that are paired with specifically crafted captions by incorporating class names and diverse pathology descriptions. Our Histo-VL includes 26 organs, 31 cancer types, and a wide variety of tissue obtained from 14 heterogeneous patient cohorts, totaling more than 5 million patches obtained from over 41K WSIs viewed under various magnification levels. We systematically evaluate existing histopathology VLMs on Histo-VL to simulate diverse tasks performed by experts in real-world clinical scenarios. Our analysis reveals interesting findings, including large sensitivity of most existing histopathology VLMs to textual changes with a drop in balanced accuracy of up to 25% in tasks such as Metastasis detection, low robustness to adversarial attacks, as well as improper calibration of models evident through high ECE values and low model prediction confidence, all of which can affect their clinical implementation.</p></details> |  |

However, due to their inherent representation biases originating from different training paradigms, VFMs exhibit advantages and disadvantages across distinct vision tasks. Although amalgamating the strengths of multiple VFMs for downstream tasks is an intuitive strategy, effectively exploiting these biases remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and versatile "Swiss Army Knife" (SAK) solution, which adaptively distills knowledge from a committee of VFMs to enhance multi-task learning. Unlike existing methods that use a single backbone for knowledge transfer, our approach preserves the unique representation bias of each teacher by collaborating the lightweight Teacher-Specific Adapter Path modules with the Teacher-Agnostic Stem. Through dynamic selection and combination of representations with Mixture-of-Representations Routers, our SAK is capable of synergizing the complementary strengths of multiple VFMs. Extensive experiments show that our SAK remarkably outperforms prior state of the arts in multi-task learning by 10% on the NYUD-v2 benchmark, while also providing a flexible and robust framework that can readily accommodate more advanced model designs.

However, learning-based registration approaches lack generalizability across diverse clinical scenarios, requiring the laborious development of multiple isolated networks for specific registration tasks, e.g., inter-/intra-subject registration or organ-specific alignment. % To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{UniReg}, the first interactive foundation model for medical image registration, which combines the precision advantages of task-specific learning methods with the generalization of traditional optimization methods. Our key innovation is a unified framework for diverse registration scenarios, achieved through a conditional deformation field estimation within a unified registration model. This is realized through a dynamic learning paradigm that explicitly encodes: (1) anatomical structure priors, (2) registration type constraints (inter/intra-subject), and (3) instance-specific features, enabling the generation of scenario-optimal deformation fields. % Through comprehensive experiments encompassing $90$ anatomical structures at different body regions, our UniReg model demonstrates comparable performance with contemporary state-of-the-art methodologies while achieving ~50\% reduction in required training iterations relative to the conventional learning-based paradigm. This optimization contributes to a significant reduction in computational resources, such as training time. Code and model will be available.</p></details> |  |

Our method utilizes multi-modal models to identify material types and initialize material parameters through image queries, while simultaneously inferring 3D Gaussian splats for detailed scene representation. We further refine these material parameters using video diffusion with a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) and optical flow guidance rather than render loss or Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) loss.

Despite rapid advancements in the field of deepfake detection, developing efficient approaches to leverage foundation models for improved generalizability to unseen forgery samples remains challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a novel side-network-based decoder that extracts spatial and temporal cues using the CLIP image encoder for generalized video-based Deepfake detection. Additionally, we introduce Facial Component Guidance (FCG) to enhance spatial learning generalizability by encouraging the model to focus on key facial regions. By leveraging the generic features of a vision-language foundation model, our approach demonstrates promising generalizability on challenging Deepfake datasets while also exhibiting superiority in training data efficiency, parameter efficiency, and model robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Token-level Text Image Foundation Model for Document Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02304v2)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, general visual foundation models (VFMs) have witnessed increasing adoption, particularly as image encoders for popular multi-modal large language models (MLLMs). However, without semantically fine-grained supervision, these models still encounter fundamental prediction errors in the context of downstream text-image-related tasks, i.e., perception, understanding and reasoning with images containing small and dense texts. To bridge this gap, we develop TokenOCR, the first token-level visual foundation model specifically tailored for text-image-related tasks, designed to support a variety of traditional downstream applications. To facilitate the pretraining of TokenOCR, we also devise a high-quality data production pipeline that constructs the first token-level image text dataset, TokenIT, comprising 20 million images and 1.8 billion token-mask pairs. Furthermore, leveraging this foundation with exceptional image-as-text capability, we seamlessly replace previous VFMs with TokenOCR to construct a document-level MLLM, TokenVL, for VQA-based document understanding tasks. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TokenOCR and TokenVL.

However, most existing models focus on short-span perception tasks, lacking the long-term reasoning required for CE detection. CEs consist of sequences of short-time atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal dependencies. Detecting them is difficult due to long, noisy sensor data and the challenge of filtering out irrelevant AEs while capturing meaningful patterns. This work explores CE detection as a case study for CPS-IoT foundation models capable of long-term reasoning. We evaluate three approaches: (1) leveraging large language models (LLMs), (2) employing various neural architectures that learn CE rules from data, and (3) adopting a neurosymbolic approach that integrates neural models with symbolic engines embedding human knowledge. Our results show that the state-space model, Mamba, which belongs to the second category, outperforms all methods in accuracy and generalization to longer, unseen sensor traces. These findings suggest that state-space models could be a strong backbone for CPS-IoT foundation models for long-span reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Impact of Noisy Supervision in Foundation Model Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06869v2)** | 2025-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are usually pre-trained on large-scale datasets and then adapted to downstream tasks through tuning. However, the large-scale pre-training datasets, often inaccessible or too expensive to handle, can contain label noise that may adversely affect the generalization of the model and pose unexpected risks. This paper stands out as the first work to comprehensively understand and analyze the nature of noise in pre-training datasets and then effectively mitigate its impacts on downstream tasks. Specifically, through extensive experiments of fully-supervised and image-text contrastive pre-training on synthetic noisy ImageNet-1K, YFCC15M, and CC12M datasets, we demonstrate that, while slight noise in pre-training can benefit in-domain (ID) performance, where the training and testing data share a similar distribution, it always deteriorates out-of-domain (OOD) performance, where training and testing distributions are significantly different. These observations are agnostic to scales of pre-training datasets, pre-training noise types, model architectures, pre-training objectives, downstream tuning methods, and downstream applications. We empirically ascertain that the reason behind this is that the pre-training noise shapes the feature space differently. We then propose a tuning method (NMTune) to affine the feature space to mitigate the malignant effect of noise and improve generalization, which is applicable in both parameter-efficient and black-box tuning manners. We additionally conduct extensive experiments on popular vision and language models, including APIs, which are supervised and self-supervised pre-trained on realistic noisy data for evaluation. Our analysis and results demonstrate the importance of this novel and fundamental research direction, which we term as Noisy Model Learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables, preprint. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2309.17002</p></details> |

However, most existing efforts remain limited to fixed spectral sensors, focus solely on the Earth's surface, and overlook valuable metadata beyond imagery. In this work, we take a step towards next-generation EO foundation models with three key components: 1) Copernicus-Pretrain, a massive-scale pretraining dataset that integrates 18.7M aligned images from all major Copernicus Sentinel missions, spanning from the Earth's surface to its atmosphere; 2) Copernicus-FM, a unified foundation model capable of processing any spectral or non-spectral sensor modality using extended dynamic hypernetworks and flexible metadata encoding; and 3) Copernicus-Bench, a systematic evaluation benchmark with 15 hierarchical downstream tasks ranging from preprocessing to specialized applications for each Sentinel mission. Our dataset, model, and benchmark greatly improve the scalability, versatility, and multimodal adaptability of EO foundation models, while also creating new opportunities to connect EO, weather, and climate research.

This is due to significant imaging modality-specific variations in artifacts, vascular patterns and scales, signal-to-noise ratios, and background tissues. These variations, along with domain gaps arising from varying imaging protocols, limit the generalization of existing supervised learning-based methods, requiring tedious voxel-level annotations for each dataset separately. While foundation models promise to alleviate this limitation, they typically fail to generalize to the task of blood vessel segmentation, posing a unique, complex problem. In this work, we present vesselFM, a foundation model designed specifically for the broad task of 3D blood vessel segmentation. Unlike previous models, vesselFM can effortlessly generalize to unseen domains. To achieve zero-shot generalization, we train vesselFM on three heterogeneous data sources: a large, curated annotated dataset, data generated by a domain randomization scheme, and data sampled from a flow matching-based generative model. Extensive evaluations show that vesselFM outperforms state-of-the-art medical image segmentation foundation models across four (pre-)clinically relevant imaging modalities in zero-, one-, and few-shot scenarios, therefore providing a universal solution for 3D blood vessel segmentation.</p></details> |  |

The mainstream personalization models employ identity embedding to integrate identity information within the cross-attention mechanisms of UNet. However, our preliminary experimental findings reveal that identity embeddings compromise the effectiveness of other tokens in the prompt, thereby limiting high prompt consistency and controllability. Moreover, by deactivating identity embedding, personalization models still demonstrate the underlying foundation models' ability to control facial attributes precisely. It suggests that such foundation models' knowledge can be leveraged to \textbf{cure} the ill-aligned prompt consistency of personalization models. Building upon these insights, we propose \textbf{FreeCure}, a framework that improves the prompt consistency of personalization models with their latent foundation models' knowledge. First, by setting a dual inference paradigm with/without identity embedding, we identify attributes (\textit{e.g.}, hair, accessories, etc.) for enhancements. Second, we introduce a novel foundation-aware self-attention module, coupled with an inversion-based process to bring well-aligned attribute information to the personalization process. Our approach is \textbf{training-free}, and can effectively enhance a wide array of facial attributes in a non-intrusive manner; and it can be seamlessly integrated into existing popular personalization models, without harming their well-trained modules. FreeCure has demonstrated significant improvements in prompt consistency across a diverse set of state-of-the-art facial personalization models while maintaining the integrity of original identity fidelity.

For each institution, however, pre-training RSFMs with limited data in a standalone manner may lead to suboptimal performance, while aggregating remote sensing data from multiple institutions for centralized pre-training raises privacy concerns. Seeking for collaboration is a promising solution to resolve this dilemma, where multiple institutions can collaboratively train RSFMs without sharing private data. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserved pre-training framework (FedSense), which enables multiple institutions to collaboratively train RSFMs without sharing private data. However, it is a non-trivial task hindered by a vicious cycle, which results from model drift by remote sensing data heterogeneity and high communication overhead. To break this vicious cycle, we introduce Federated Mutual-guidance Learning. Specifically, we propose a Server-to-Clients Guidance (SCG) mechanism to guide clients updates towards global-flatness optimal solutions. Additionally, we propose a Clients-to-Server Guidance (CSG) mechanism to inject local knowledge into the server by low-bit communication. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our FedSense in both full-precision and communication-reduced scenarios, showcasing remarkable communication efficiency and performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We present Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA), which aligns audiovisual (AV) scene content beyond mere temporal synchronization via a Large Language Model (LLM)-based data curation pipeline. Specifically, AVVA scores and selects high-quality training clips using Whisper (speech-based audio foundation model) for audio and DINOv2 for video within a dual-encoder contrastive learning framework. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate that this approach can achieve significant accuracy gains with substantially less curated data. For instance, AVVA yields a 7.6% improvement in top-1 accuracy for audio-to-video retrieval on VGGSound compared to ImageBind, despite training on only 192 hours of carefully filtered data (vs. 5800+ hours). Moreover, an ablation study highlights that trading data quantity for data quality improves performance, yielding respective top-3 accuracy increases of 47.8, 48.4, and 58.0 percentage points on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound over uncurated baselines. While these results underscore AVVA's data efficiency, we also discuss the overhead of LLM-driven curation and how it may be scaled or approximated in larger domains. Overall, AVVA provides a viable path toward more robust, text-free audiovisual learning with improved retrieval accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are withdrawing this version due to the need for substantial updates in scope and organization, which affect the clarity and completeness of the manuscript.

| **[Siamese Foundation Models for Crystal Structure Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10471v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), which aims to generate stable crystal structures from compositions, represents a critical pathway for discovering novel materials. While structure prediction tasks in other domains, such as proteins, have seen remarkable progress, CSP remains a relatively underexplored area due to the more complex geometries inherent in crystal structures. In this paper, we propose Siamese foundation models specifically designed to address CSP. Our pretrain-finetune framework, named DAO, comprises two complementary foundation models: DAO-G for structure generation and DAO-P for energy prediction. Experiments on CSP benchmarks (MP-20 and MPTS-52) demonstrate that our DAO-G significantly surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all metrics. Extensive ablation studies further confirm that DAO-G excels in generating diverse polymorphic structures, and the dataset relaxation and energy guidance provided by DAO-P are essential for enhancing DAO-G's performance. When applied to three real-world superconductors ($\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, $ \text{Zr}_{16}\text{Rh}_8\text{O}_4$ and $\text{Zr}_{16}\text{Pd}_8\text{O}_4$) that are known to be challenging to analyze, our foundation models achieve accurate critical temperature predictions and structure generations. For instance, on $\text{CsV}_3\text{Sb}_5$, DAO-G generates a structure close to the experimental one with an RMSE of 0.0085; DAO-P predicts the $T_c$ value with high accuracy (2.26 K vs. the ground-truth value of 2.30 K). In contrast, conventional DFT calculators like Quantum Espresso only successfully derive the structure of the first superconductor within an acceptable time, while the RMSE is nearly 8 times larger, and the computation speed is more than 1000 times slower.

We develop a framework - the "Society of HiveMind" (SOHM) - that orchestrates the interaction between multiple AI foundation models, imitating the observed behavior of animal swarms in nature by following modern evolutionary theories. On the one hand, we find that the SOHM provides a negligible benefit on tasks that mainly require real-world knowledge. On the other hand, we remark a significant improvement on tasks that require intensive logical reasoning, indicating that multi-agent systems are capable of increasing the reasoning capabilities of the collective compared to the individual agents. Our findings demonstrate the potential of combining a multitude of diverse AI foundation models to form an artificial swarm intelligence capable of self-improvement through interactions with a given environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (excl. appendix)</p></details> |
| **[RoMA: Scaling up Mamba-based Foundation Models for Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10392v1)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervised learning for Vision Transformers (ViTs) have fueled breakthroughs in remote sensing (RS) foundation models. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/RoMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVLA: Reverting Visual Domain Limitation of Robotic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15250v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models and access to large-scale robotic datasets has sparked a paradigm shift in robotics models transforming them into generalists able to adapt to various tasks, scenes, and robot modalities. A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA-2025, Atlanta</p></details> |
| **[MarS: a Financial Market Simulation Engine Powered by Generative Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07486v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models aim to simulate realistic effects of various actions across different contexts, from text generation to visual effects. Despite significant efforts to build real-world simulators, the application of generative models to virtual worlds, like financial markets, remains under-explored. In financial markets, generative models can simulate complex market effects of participants with various behaviors, enabling interaction under different market conditions, and training strategies without financial risk. This simulation relies on the finest structured data in financial market like orders thus building the finest realistic simulation. We propose Large Market Model (LMM), an order-level generative foundation model, for financial market simulation, akin to language modeling in the digital world. Our financial Market Simulation engine (MarS), powered by LMM, addresses the domain-specific need for realistic, interactive and controllable order generation. Key observations include LMM's strong scalability across data size and model complexity, and MarS's robust and practicable realism in controlled generation with market impact. We showcase MarS as a forecast tool, detection system, analysis platform, and agent training environment, thus demonstrating MarS's "paradigm shift" potential for a variety of financial applications. We release the code of MarS at https://github.com/microsoft/MarS/.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 26 figures, ICLR 2025</p></details> |

A Holistic Embodied Cognition Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05031v2)** | 2025-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The enhancement of generalization in robots by large vision-language models (LVLMs) is increasingly evident. Therefore, the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs based on egocentric videos are of great interest. However, current datasets for embodied video question answering lack comprehensive and systematic evaluation frameworks. Critical embodied cognitive issues, such as robotic self-cognition, dynamic scene perception, and hallucination, are rarely addressed. To tackle these challenges, we propose ECBench, a high-quality benchmark designed to systematically evaluate the embodied cognitive abilities of LVLMs. ECBench features a diverse range of scene video sources, open and varied question formats, and 30 dimensions of embodied cognition. To ensure quality, balance, and high visual dependence, ECBench uses class-independent meticulous human annotation and multi-round question screening strategies. Additionally, we introduce ECEval, a comprehensive evaluation system that ensures the fairness and rationality of the indicators. Utilizing ECBench, we conduct extensive evaluations of proprietary, open-source, and task-specific LVLMs. ECBench is pivotal in advancing the embodied cognitive capabilities of LVLMs, laying a solid foundation for developing reliable core models for embodied agents. All data and code are available at https://github.com/Rh-Dang/ECBench.</p></details> |  |

Traditional single-modality approaches often fail to leverage the complementary insights provided by radiological and pathological assessments. In this work, we introduce M4Survive (Multi-Modal Mamba Modeling for Survival Prediction), a novel framework that learns joint foundation model representations using efficient adapter networks. Our approach dynamically fuses heterogeneous embeddings from a foundation model repository (e.g., MedImageInsight, BiomedCLIP, Prov-GigaPath, UNI2-h), creating a correlated latent space optimized for survival risk estimation. By leveraging Mamba-based adapters, M4Survive enables efficient multi-modal learning while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms both unimodal and traditional static multi-modal baselines in survival prediction accuracy. This work underscores the potential of foundation model-driven multi-modal fusion in advancing precision oncology and predictive analytics.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The advancement of deep learning has facilitated the creation of numerous medical datasets with diverse expert-level annotations. Aggregating these datasets can maximize data utilization and address the inadequacy of labeled data. However, the heterogeneity of expert-level annotations across tasks such as classification, localization, and segmentation presents a significant challenge for learning from these datasets. To this end, we introduce nFoundation X, an end-to-end framework that utilizes diverse expert-level annotations from numerous public datasets to train a foundation model capable of multiple tasks including classification, localization, and segmentation. To address the challenges of annotation and task heterogeneity, we propose a Lock-Release pretraining strategy to enhance the cyclic learning from multiple datasets, combined with the student-teacher learning paradigm, ensuring the model retains general knowledge for all tasks while preventing overfitting to any single task. To demonstrate the effectiveness of Foundation X, we trained a model using 11 chest X-ray datasets, covering annotations for classification, localization, and segmentation tasks. Our experimental results show that Foundation X achieves notable performance gains through extensive annotation utilization, excels in cross-dataset and cross-task learning, and further enhances performance in organ localization and segmentation tasks.

| **[Revisiting semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09707v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) leverages abundant unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to enhance learning. As vision foundation models (VFMs) increasingly serve as the backbone of vision applications, it remains unclear how SSL interacts with these pre-trained models. To address this gap, we develop new SSL benchmark datasets where frozen VFMs underperform and systematically evaluate representative SSL methods. We make a surprising observation: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using only labeled data often matches SSL performance, even without leveraging unlabeled data. This motivates us to revisit self-training, a conceptually simple SSL baseline, where we use the supervised PEFT model to pseudo-label unlabeled data for further training. To overcome the notorious issue of noisy pseudo-labels, we propose ensembling multiple PEFT approaches and VFM backbones to produce more robust pseudo-labels. Empirical results validate the effectiveness of this simple yet powerful approach, providing actionable insights into SSL with VFMs and paving the way for more scalable and practical semi-supervised learning in the era of foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameter-Efficient Adaptation of Geospatial Foundation Models through Embedding Deflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09493v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large-scale heterogeneous data sets become increasingly available, adapting foundation models at low cost has become a key issue. Seminal works in natural language processing, e.g. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), leverage the low "intrinsic rank" of parameter updates during adaptation. In this paper, we argue that incorporating stronger inductive biases in both data and models can enhance the adaptation of Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs), pretrained on RGB satellite images, to other types of optical satellite data. Specifically, the pretrained parameters of GFMs serve as a strong prior for the spatial structure of multispectral images. For this reason, we introduce DEFLECT (Deflecting Embeddings for Finetuning Latent representations for Earth and Climate Tasks), a novel strategy for adapting GFMs to multispectral satellite imagery with very few additional parameters. DEFLECT improves the representation capabilities of the extracted features, particularly enhancing spectral information, which is essential for geoscience and environmental-related tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across three different GFMs and five diverse datasets, ranging from forest monitoring to marine environment segmentation. Compared to competing methods, DEFLECT achieves on-par or higher accuracy with 5-10$\times$ fewer parameters for classification and segmentation tasks. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

For this reason, they are susceptible to the memorization and subsequent reproduction of training samples. In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights can be considered a reproduction or, more likely, a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers. We demonstrate that adopting an information-centric approach to the problem presents a promising pathway for tackling these emerging complex legal issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight presentation at GenLaw'24, see https://www.genlaw.org/2024-icml-papers#training-foundation-models-as-data-compression-on-information-model-weights-and-copyright-law</p></details> |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: A Transferability Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09363v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) have gained significant attention for their potential to generalize across diverse graph domains and tasks. Some works focus on Domain-Specific GFMs, which are designed to address a variety of tasks within a specific domain, while others aim to create General-Purpose GFMs that extend the capabilities of domain-specific models to multiple domains. Regardless of the type, transferability is crucial for applying GFMs across different domains and tasks. However, achieving strong transferability is a major challenge due to the structural, feature, and distributional variations in graph data. To date, there has been no systematic research examining and analyzing GFMs from the perspective of transferability. To bridge the gap, we present the first comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes and analyzes existing GFMs through the lens of transferability, structuring GFMs around their application scope (domain-specific vs. general-purpose) and their approaches to knowledge acquisition and transfer. We provide a structured perspective on current progress and identify potential pathways for advancing GFM generalization across diverse graph datasets and tasks. We aims to shed light on the current landscape of GFMs and inspire future research directions in GFM development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Spatio-Temporal Data Science: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13502v1)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal (ST) data science, which includes sensing, managing, and mining large-scale data across space and time, is fundamental to understanding complex systems in domains such as urban computing, climate science, and intelligent transportation. Traditional deep learning approaches have significantly advanced this field, particularly in the stage of ST data mining. However, these models remain task-specific and often require extensive labeled data. Inspired by the success of Foundation Models (FM), especially large language models, researchers have begun exploring the concept of Spatio-Temporal Foundation Models (STFMs) to enhance adaptability and generalization across diverse ST tasks. Unlike prior architectures, STFMs empower the entire workflow of ST data science, ranging from data sensing, management, to mining, thereby offering a more holistic and scalable approach. Despite rapid progress, a systematic study of STFMs for ST data science remains lacking. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive review of STFMs, categorizing existing methodologies and identifying key research directions to advance ST general intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Foundation Models for Material Property Prediction and Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00111v4)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence is transforming computational materials science, improving the prediction of material properties, and accelerating the discovery of novel materials. Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |
| **[ByteCheckpoint: A Unified Checkpointing System for Large Foundation Model Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20143v3)** | 2025-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Checkpointing to preserve training states is crucial during the development of Large Foundation Models (LFMs), for training resumption upon various failures or changes in GPU resources and parallelism configurations. In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production environments, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale throughout the lifecycle of LFM development. We introduce ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint features: a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding; a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends; full-stack optimizations to ensure high I/O efficiency and scalability; a suite of monitoring tools to streamline large-scale performance analysis and bottleneck detection. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [52, 58], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</p></details> |  |
