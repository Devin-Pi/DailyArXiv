| **[CAD-GPT: Synthesising CAD Construction Sequence with Spatial Reasoning-Enhanced Multimodal LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19663v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-aided design (CAD) significantly enhances the efficiency, accuracy, and innovation of design processes by enabling precise 2D and 3D modeling, extensive analysis, and optimization. Existing methods for creating CAD models rely on latent vectors or point clouds, which are difficult to obtain and costly to store. Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have inspired researchers to use natural language instructions and images for CAD model construction. However, these models still struggle with inferring accurate 3D spatial location and orientation, leading to inaccuracies in determining the spatial 3D starting points and extrusion directions for constructing geometries. This work introduces CAD-GPT, a CAD synthesis method with spatial reasoning-enhanced MLLM that takes either a single image or a textual description as input. To achieve precise spatial inference, our approach introduces a 3D Modeling Spatial Mechanism. This method maps 3D spatial positions and 3D sketch plane rotation angles into a 1D linguistic feature space using a specialized spatial unfolding mechanism, while discretizing 2D sketch coordinates into an appropriate planar space to enable precise determination of spatial starting position, sketch orientation, and 2D sketch coordinate translations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CAD-GPT consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in CAD model synthesis, both quantitatively and qualitatively.</p></details> |  |
| **[MNet-SAt: A Multiscale Network with Spatial-enhanced Attention for Segmentation of Polyps in Colonoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19464v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: To develop a novel deep learning framework for the automated segmentation of colonic polyps in colonoscopy images, overcoming the limitations of current approaches in preserving precise polyp boundaries, incorporating multi-scale features, and modeling spatial dependencies that accurately reflect the intricate and diverse morphology of polyps. Methods: To address these limitations, we propose a novel Multiscale Network with Spatial-enhanced Attention (MNet-SAt) for polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images. This framework incorporates four key modules: Edge-Guided Feature Enrichment (EGFE) preserves edge information for improved boundary quality; Multi-Scale Feature Aggregator (MSFA) extracts and aggregates multi-scale features across channel spatial dimensions, focusing on salient regions; Spatial-Enhanced Attention (SEAt) captures spatial-aware global dependencies within the multi-scale aggregated features, emphasizing the region of interest; and Channel-Enhanced Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CE-ASPP) resamples and recalibrates attentive features across scales. Results: We evaluated MNet-SAt on the Kvasir-SEG and CVC-ClinicDB datasets, achieving Dice Similarity Coefficients of 96.61% and 98.60%, respectively. Conclusion: Both quantitative (DSC) and qualitative assessments highlight MNet-SAt's superior performance and generalization capabilities compared to existing methods. Significance: MNet-SAt's high accuracy in polyp segmentation holds promise for improving clinical workflows in early polyp detection and more effective treatment, contributing to reduced colorectal cancer mortality rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Monocular 3D Object Detection from Scene-Level Depth Retargeting to Instance-Level Spatial Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19165v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D object detection is challenging due to the lack of accurate depth. However, existing depth-assisted solutions still exhibit inferior performance, whose reason is universally acknowledged as the unsatisfactory accuracy of monocular depth estimation models. In this paper, we revisit monocular 3D object detection from the depth perspective and formulate an additional issue as the limited 3D structure-aware capability of existing depth representations (\textit{e.g.}, depth one-hot encoding or depth distribution). To address this issue, we propose a novel depth-adapted monocular 3D object detection network, termed \textbf{RD3D}, that mainly comprises a Scene-Level Depth Retargeting (SDR) module and an Instance-Level Spatial Refinement (ISR) module. The former incorporates the scene-level perception of 3D structures, retargeting traditional depth representations to a new formulation: \textbf{Depth Thickness Field}. The latter refines the voxel spatial representation with the guidance of instances, eliminating the ambiguity of 3D occupation and thus improving detection accuracy. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate our superiority to existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods and the universality when equipped with different depth estimation models. The code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[TraceVLA: Visual Trace Prompting Enhances Spatial-Temporal Awareness for Generalist Robotic Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10345v2)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large vision-language-action (VLA) models pretrained on extensive robot datasets offer promising generalist policies for robotic learning, they still struggle with spatial-temporal dynamics in interactive robotics, making them less effective in handling complex tasks, such as manipulation. In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Structure Learning for Spatial-Temporal Imputation: Adapting to Node and Feature Scales](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18535v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal data collected across different geographic locations often suffer from missing values, posing challenges to data analysis. Existing methods primarily leverage fixed spatial graphs to impute missing values, which implicitly assume that the spatial relationship is roughly the same for all features across different locations. However, they may overlook the different spatial relationships of diverse features recorded by sensors in different locations. To address this, we introduce the multi-scale Graph Structure Learning framework for spatial-temporal Imputation (GSLI) that dynamically adapts to the heterogeneous spatial correlations. Our framework encompasses node-scale graph structure learning to cater to the distinct global spatial correlations of different features, and feature-scale graph structure learning to unveil common spatial correlation across features within all stations. Integrated with prominence modeling, our framework emphasizes nodes and features with greater significance in the imputation process. Furthermore, GSLI incorporates cross-feature and cross-temporal representation learning to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. Evaluated on six real incomplete spatial-temporal datasets, GSLI showcases the improvement in data imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a full paper at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[VORTEX: A Spatial Computing Framework for Optimized Drone Telemetry Extraction from First-Person View Flight Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18505v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the Visual Optical Recognition Telemetry EXtraction (VORTEX) system for extracting and analyzing drone telemetry data from First Person View (FPV) Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) footage. VORTEX employs MMOCR, a PyTorch-based Optical Character Recognition (OCR) toolbox, to extract telemetry variables from drone Heads Up Display (HUD) recordings, utilizing advanced image preprocessing techniques, including CLAHE enhancement and adaptive thresholding. The study optimizes spatial accuracy and computational efficiency through systematic investigation of temporal sampling rates (1s, 5s, 10s, 15s, 20s) and coordinate processing methods. Results demonstrate that the 5-second sampling rate, utilizing 4.07% of available frames, provides the optimal balance with a point retention rate of 64% and mean speed accuracy within 4.2% of the 1-second baseline while reducing computational overhead by 80.5%. Comparative analysis of coordinate processing methods reveals that while UTM Zone 33N projection and Haversine calculations provide consistently similar results (within 0.1% difference), raw WGS84 coordinates underestimate distances by 15-30% and speeds by 20-35%. Altitude measurements showed unexpected resilience to sampling rate variations, with only 2.1% variation across all intervals. This research is the first of its kind, providing quantitative benchmarks for establishing a robust framework for drone telemetry extraction and analysis using open-source tools and spatial libraries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Addressing Spatial-Temporal Data Heterogeneity in Federated Continual Learning via Tail Anchor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18355v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated continual learning (FCL) allows each client to continually update its knowledge from task streams, enhancing the applicability of federated learning in real-world scenarios. However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Moreover, three novel components are also included in FedTA: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server side; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features, remaining unaffected by spatial and temporal changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Space-time Video Super-resolution via Spatial-temporal Feature Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08960v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The target of space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) is to increase both the frame rate (also referred to as the temporal resolution) and the spatial resolution of a given video. Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/yuezijie/STINet-Space-time-Video-Super-resolution.</p></details> | Neural Networks |

Although benchmarks like MME, MMBench and SEED comprehensively have evaluated various capabilities which already include visual spatial reasoning(VSR). There is still a lack of sufficient quantity and quality evaluation and optimization datasets for Vision Large Language Models(VLLMs) specifically targeting visual positional reasoning. To handle this, we first diagnosed current VLLMs with the VSR dataset and proposed a unified test set. We found current VLLMs to exhibit a contradiction of over-sensitivity to language instructions and under-sensitivity to visual positional information. By expanding the original benchmark from two aspects of tunning data and model structure, we mitigated this phenomenon. To our knowledge, we expanded spatially positioned image data controllably using diffusion models for the first time and integrated original visual encoding(CLIP) with other 3 powerful visual encoders(SigLIP, SAM and DINO). After conducting combination experiments on scaling data and models, we obtained a VLLM VSR Expert(VSRE) that not only generalizes better to different instructions but also accurately distinguishes differences in visual positional information. VSRE achieved over a 27\% increase in accuracy on the VSR test set. It becomes a performant VLLM on the position reasoning of both the VSR dataset and relevant subsets of other evaluation benchmarks. We open-sourced the expanded model with data and Appendix at \url{https://github.com/peijin360/vsre} and hope it will accelerate advancements in VLLM on VSR learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[ODMixer: Fine-grained Spatial-temporal MLP for Metro Origin-Destination Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15734v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metro Origin-Destination (OD) prediction is a crucial yet challenging spatial-temporal prediction task in urban computing, which aims to accurately forecast cross-station ridership for optimizing metro scheduling and enhancing overall transport efficiency. Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we learn traffic evolution from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing spatial relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer.

| **[Unsupervised learning of spatially varying regularization for diffeomorphic image registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17982v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially varying regularization accommodates the deformation variations that may be necessary for different anatomical regions during deformable image registration. Historically, optimization-based registration models have harnessed spatially varying regularization to address anatomical subtleties. However, most modern deep learning-based models tend to gravitate towards spatially invariant regularization, wherein a homogenous regularization strength is applied across the entire image, potentially disregarding localized variations. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical probabilistic model that integrates a prior distribution on the deformation regularization strength, enabling the end-to-end learning of a spatially varying deformation regularizer directly from the data. The proposed method is straightforward to implement and easily integrates with various registration network architectures. Additionally, automatic tuning of hyperparameters is achieved through Bayesian optimization, allowing efficient identification of optimal hyperparameters for any given registration task. Comprehensive evaluations on publicly available datasets demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves registration performance and enhances the interpretability of deep learning-based registration, all while maintaining smooth deformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at http://bit.ly/3BrXGxz</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Multilevel Bivariate Spatial Modelling of Italian School Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17710v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the relationship between the student's abilities in the second year of high school and the infrastructural endowment in all Italian municipalities, using spatial Bayesian modelling. Municipal student scores are obtained by averaging standardized and spatially homogeneous indicators of student outcomes provided by the Invalsi Institute for two subjects, Italian and Mathematics. Given the nature of the data, we employ a multilevel regression model assuming a bivariate Intrinsic Conditionally Autoregressive (ICAR) latent effect to explain the spatial variability and account for the correlation between the two subjects. Bayesian model estimation is obtained by the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA), implemented in the \texttt{R-INLA} package. We find that alongside a significant association with the current state of school infrastructure and facilities, spatially structured latent effects are still necessary to explain the different student outcomes across municipalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transport-Hub-Aware Spatial-Temporal Adaptive Graph Transformer for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08328v3)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a core technology of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS), traffic flow prediction has a wide range of applications. Traffic flow data are spatial-temporal, which are not only correlated to spatial locations in road networks, but also vary with temporal time indices. Existing methods have solved the challenges in traffic flow prediction partly, focusing on modeling spatial-temporal dependencies effectively, while not all intrinsic properties of traffic flow data are utilized fully. Besides, there are very few attempts at incremental learning of spatial-temporal data mining, and few previous works can be easily transferred to the traffic flow prediction task. Motivated by the challenge of incremental learning methods for traffic flow prediction and the underutilization of intrinsic properties of road networks, we propose a Transport-Hub-aware Spatial-Temporal adaptive graph transFormer (H-STFormer) for traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first design a novel spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Three graph masking matrices are integrated into spatial self-attentions to highlight both short- and long-term dependences. Additionally, we employ a temporal self-attention module to detect dynamic temporal patterns in the traffic flow data. Finally, we design an extra spatial-temporal knowledge distillation module for incremental learning of traffic flow prediction tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of H-STFormer in normal and incremental traffic flow prediction tasks. The code is available at https://github.com/Fantasy-Shaw/H-STFormer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Previ...</summary><p>Previous submissions on arxiv are early versions of this manuscript, the latest of which has been rejected by T-ITS.

To address these challenges, Coordinated Spatial Reuse (C-SR) can potentially contribute to optimizing spectrum resource utilization. This mechanism is expected to enable a higher number of simultaneous transmissions, thereby boosting spectral efficiency in dense environments and increasing the overall network performance. In this paper, we focus on the performance analysis of C-SR in Wi-Fi 8 networks. In particular, we consider an implementation of C-SR where channel access and inter-Access Point (AP) communication are performed over-the-air using the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). For such a purpose, we leverage the well-known Bianchi's throughput model and extend it to support multi-AP transmissions via C-SR. Numerical results in a WLAN network that consists of four APs show C-SR throughput gains ranging from 54% to 280% depending on the inter-AP distance and the position of the stations in the area.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source Spatial Knowledge Understanding for Immersive Visual Text-to-Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14101v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Text-to-Speech (VTTS) aims to take the environmental image as the prompt to synthesize reverberant speech for the spoken content. Previous works focus on the RGB modality for global environmental modeling, overlooking the potential of multi-source spatial knowledge like depth, speaker position, and environmental semantics. To address these issues, we propose a novel multi-source spatial knowledge understanding scheme for immersive VTTS, termed MS2KU-VTTS. Specifically, we first prioritize RGB image as the dominant source and consider depth image, speaker position knowledge from object detection, and Gemini-generated semantic captions as supplementary sources. Afterwards, we propose a serial interaction mechanism to effectively integrate both dominant and supplementary sources. The resulting multi-source knowledge is dynamically integrated based on the respective contributions of each source.This enriched interaction and integration of multi-source spatial knowledge guides the speech generation model, enhancing the immersive speech experience. Experimental results demonstrate that the MS$^2$KU-VTTS surpasses existing baselines in generating immersive speech. Demos and code are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/MS2KU-VTTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, Accepted by ICASSP'2025</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Temporal-Spatial Reasoning Capacity of GPT for Training-Free Audio and Language Referenced Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15876v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an Audio-Language-Referenced SAM 2 (AL-Ref-SAM 2) pipeline to explore the training-free paradigm for audio and language-referenced video object segmentation, namely AVS and RVOS tasks. The intuitive solution leverages GroundingDINO to identify the target object from a single frame and SAM 2 to segment the identified object throughout the video, which is less robust to spatiotemporal variations due to a lack of video context exploration. Thus, in our AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline, we propose a novel GPT-assisted Pivot Selection (GPT-PS) module to instruct GPT-4 to perform two-step temporal-spatial reasoning for sequentially selecting pivot frames and pivot boxes, thereby providing SAM 2 with a high-quality initial object prompt. Within GPT-PS, two task-specific Chain-of-Thought prompts are designed to unleash GPT's temporal-spatial reasoning capacity by guiding GPT to make selections based on a comprehensive understanding of video and reference information. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Binded Reference Unification (LBRU) module to convert audio signals into language-formatted references, thereby unifying the formats of AVS and RVOS tasks in the same pipeline. Extensive experiments on both tasks show that our training-free AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline achieves performances comparable to or even better than fully-supervised fine-tuning methods. The code is available at: https://github.com/appletea233/AL-Ref-SAM2.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[The evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods game with tolerant punishment based on reputation threshold](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17351v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reputation and punishment are significant guidelines for regulating individual behavior in human society, and those with a good reputation are more likely to be imitated by others. In addition, society imposes varying degrees of punishment for behaviors that harm the interests of groups with different reputations. However, conventional pairwise interaction rules and the punishment mechanism overlook this aspect. Building on this observation, this paper enhances a spatial public goods game in two key ways: 1) We set a reputation threshold and use punishment to regulate the defection behavior of players in low-reputation groups while allowing defection behavior in high-reputation game groups. 2) Differently from pairwise interaction rules, we combine reputation and payoff as the fitness of individuals to ensure that players with both high payoff and reputation have a higher chance of being imitated. Through simulations, we find that a higher reputation threshold, combined with a stringent punishment environment, can substantially enhance the level of cooperation within the population. This mechanism provides deeper insight into the widespread phenomenon of cooperation that emerges among individuals.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiffFormer: a Differential Spatial-Spectral Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17350v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) has gained significant attention because of its potential in analyzing high-dimensional data with rich spectral and spatial information. In this work, we propose the Differential Spatial-Spectral Transformer (DiffFormer), a novel framework designed to address the inherent challenges of HSIC, such as spectral redundancy and spatial discontinuity. The DiffFormer leverages a Differential Multi-Head Self-Attention (DMHSA) mechanism, which enhances local feature discrimination by introducing differential attention to accentuate subtle variations across neighboring spectral-spatial patches. The architecture integrates Spectral-Spatial Tokenization through three-dimensional (3D) convolution-based patch embeddings, positional encoding, and a stack of transformer layers equipped with the SWiGLU activation function for efficient feature extraction (SwiGLU is a variant of the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) activation function). A token-based classification head further ensures robust representation learning, enabling precise labeling of hyperspectral pixels. Extensive experiments on benchmark hyperspectral datasets demonstrate the superiority of DiffFormer in terms of classification accuracy, computational efficiency, and generalizability, compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. In addition, this work provides a detailed analysis of computational complexity, showcasing the scalability of the model for large-scale remote sensing applications. The source code will be made available at \url{https://github.com/mahmad000/DiffFormer} after the first round of revision.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-end Generative Spatial-Temporal Ultrasonic Odometry and Mapping Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17343v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performing simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) in low-visibility conditions, such as environments filled with smoke, dust and transparent objets, has long been a challenging task. Sensors like cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are significantly limited under these conditions, whereas ultrasonic sensors offer a more robust alternative. However, the low angular resolution, slow update frequency, and limited detection accuracy of ultrasonic sensors present barriers for SLAM. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end generative ultrasonic SLAM framework. This framework employs a sensor array with overlapping fields of view, leveraging the inherently low angular resolution of ultrasonic sensors to implicitly encode spatial features in conjunction with the robot's motion. Consecutive time frame data is processed through a sliding window mechanism to capture temporal features. The spatiotemporally encoded sensor data is passed through multiple modules to generate dense scan point clouds and robot pose transformations for map construction and odometry. The main contributions of this work include a novel ultrasonic sensor array that spatiotemporally encodes the surrounding environment, and an end-to-end generative SLAM framework that overcomes the inherent defects of ultrasonic sensors. Several real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures and 1 table</p></details> |
| **[HS-FPN: High Frequency and Spatial Perception FPN for Tiny Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10116v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) has significantly improved object detection performance. However, substantial challenges remain in detecting tiny objects, as their features occupy only a very small proportion of the feature maps. Although FPN integrates multi-scale features, it does not directly enhance or enrich the features of tiny objects. Furthermore, FPN lacks spatial perception ability. To address these issues, we propose a novel High Frequency and Spatial Perception Feature Pyramid Network (HS-FPN) with two innovative modules. First, we designed a high frequency perception module (HFP) that generates high frequency responses through high pass filters. These high frequency responses are used as mask weights from both spatial and channel perspectives to enrich and highlight the features of tiny objects in the original feature maps. Second, we developed a spatial dependency perception module (SDP) to capture the spatial dependencies that FPN lacks. Our experiments demonstrate that detectors based on HS-FPN exhibit competitive advantages over state-of-the-art models on the AI-TOD dataset for tiny object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages,12 figures,7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatial function-on-function regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17327v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a spatial function-on-function regression model to capture spatial dependencies in functional data by integrating spatial autoregressive techniques with functional principal component analysis. The proposed model addresses a critical gap in functional regression by enabling the analysis of functional responses influenced by spatially correlated functional predictors, a common scenario in fields such as environmental sciences, epidemiology, and socio-economic studies. The model employs a spatial functional principal component decomposition on the response and a classical functional principal component decomposition on the predictor, transforming the functional data into a finite-dimensional multivariate spatial autoregressive framework. This transformation allows efficient estimation and robust handling of spatial dependencies through least squares methods. In a series of extensive simulations, the proposed model consistently demonstrated superior performance in estimating both spatial autocorrelation and regression coefficient functions compared to some favorably existing traditional approaches, particularly under moderate to strong spatial effects. Application of the proposed model to Brazilian COVID-19 data further underscored its practical utility, revealing critical spatial patterns in confirmed cases and death rates that align with known geographic and social interactions. An R package provides a comprehensive implementation of the proposed estimation method, offering a user-friendly and efficient tool for researchers and practitioners to apply the methodology in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Neural Spatial-Temporal Tensor Representation for Infrared Small Target Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17302v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based approaches dominate infrared small target detection as they leverage infrared imagery's intrinsic low-rankness and sparsity. While effective for single-frame images, they struggle with dynamic changes in multi-frame scenarios as traditional spatial-temporal representations often fail to adapt. To address these challenges, we introduce a Neural-represented Spatial-Temporal Tensor (NeurSTT) model. This framework employs nonlinear networks to enhance spatial-temporal feature correlations in background approximation, thereby supporting target detection in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we employ neural layers to approximate sequential backgrounds within a low-rank informed deep scheme. A neural three-dimensional total variation is developed to refine background smoothness while reducing static target-like clusters in sequences. Traditional sparsity constraints are incorporated into the loss functions to preserve potential targets. By replacing complex solvers with a deep updating strategy, NeurSTT simplifies the optimization process in a domain-awareness way. Visual and numerical results across various datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms detection challenges. Notably, it has 16.6$\times$ fewer parameters and averaged 19.19\% higher in $IoU$ compared to the suboptimal method on $256 \times 256$ sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[STeInFormer: Spatial-Temporal Interaction Transformer Architecture for Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17247v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms have greatly benefited remote sensing change detection (RSCD) because of their outstanding discriminative ability. Existent RSCD methods often follow a paradigm of using a non-interactive Siamese neural network for multi-temporal feature extraction and change detection heads for feature fusion and change representation. However, this paradigm lacks the contemplation of the characteristics of RSCD in temporal and spatial dimensions, and causes the drawback on spatial-temporal interaction that hinders high-quality feature extraction. To address this problem, we present STeInFormer, a spatial-temporal interaction Transformer architecture for multi-temporal feature extraction, which is the first general backbone network specifically designed for RSCD. In addition, we propose a parameter-free multi-frequency token mixer to integrate frequency-domain features that provide spectral information for RSCD. Experimental results on three datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can outperform the state-of-the-art methods and achieve the most satisfactory efficiency-accuracy trade-off.

In practice, one must select a truncation level for use. We compare five criteria for the selection of an appropriate truncation level, including AIC and BIC based on a log composite likelihood, a fraction of variance explained criterion, a fitted mean squared error, and a prediction error with one standard error rule. Based on the use of extensive simulation studies, we propose that BIC constitutes a reasonable default criterion for the selection of the truncation level for use in a spatial functional generalized linear model. In addition, we demonstrate that the spatial model with a functional covariate outperforms other models when the data contain spatial structure and response variables are in fact influenced by a functional covariate process. We apply the spatial functional generalized linear model to a problem in which the objective is to relate COVID-19 vaccination rates in counties of states in the Midwestern United States to the number of new cases from previous weeks in those same geographic regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pleas...</summary><p>Please see: Generalized linear models with spatial dependence and a functional covariate (arXiv:2402.13472)</p></details> |

For estimation, we apply basis expansion and truncation for dimension reduction of the covariate process followed by a composite likelihood estimating equation to handle the spatial dependency. We establish asymptotic results for the proposed model under a repeating lattice asymptotic context, allowing us to construct a confidence interval for the spatial dependence parameter and a confidence band for the regression parameter function. A binary conditionals model with functional covariates is presented as a concrete illustration and is used in simulation studies to verify the applicability of the asymptotic inferential results. We apply the proposed model to a problem in which the objective is to relate annual corn yield in counties of states in the Midwestern United States to daily maximum temperatures from April to September in those same geographic regions. The extension to an expanding lattice context is further discussed in the supplement.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Temporal-spatial Analysis of Estimating Urban Traffic Patterns Via GPS Trace Data of Car-hailing Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07456v2)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Car-hailing services have become a prominent data source for urban traffic studies. Extracting useful information from car-hailing trace data is essential for effective traffic management, while discrepancies between car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic should be considered. This paper proposes a generic framework for estimating and analyzing urban traffic patterns using car-hailing trace data. The framework consists of three layers: the data layer, the interactive software layer, and the processing method layer. By pre-processing car-hailing GPS trace data with operations such as data cutting, map matching, and trace correction, the framework generates tensor matrices that estimate traffic patterns for car-hailing vehicle flow and average road speed. An analysis block based on these matrices examines the relationships and differences between car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic patterns, which have been overlooked in previous research. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in examining temporal-spatial patterns of car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic. For temporal analysis, urban road traffic displays a bimodal characteristic while car-hailing flow exhibits a 'multi-peak' pattern, fluctuating significantly during holidays and thus generating a hierarchical structure. For spatial analysis, the heat maps generated from the matrices exhibit certain discrepancies, but the spatial distribution of hotspots and vehicle aggregation areas remains similar.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional approaches frequently encounter issues like over-segmentation or mis-segmentation, due to insufficient emphasis on spatial information of instances. In this paper, we introduce a Rule-Guided Spatial Awareness Network (RG-SAN) by utilizing solely the spatial information of the target instance for supervision. This approach enables the network to accurately depict the spatial relationships among all entities described in the text, thus enhancing the reasoning capabilities. The RG-SAN consists of the Text-driven Localization Module (TLM) and the Rule-guided Weak Supervision (RWS) strategy. The TLM initially locates all mentioned instances and iteratively refines their positional information. The RWS strategy, acknowledging that only target objects have supervised positional information, employs dependency tree rules to precisely guide the core instance's positioning. Extensive testing on the ScanRefer benchmark has shown that RG-SAN not only establishes new performance benchmarks, with an mIoU increase of 5.1 points, but also exhibits significant improvements in robustness when processing descriptions with spatial ambiguity.

| **[NumbOD: A Spatial-Frequency Fusion Attack Against Object Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16955v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of deep learning, object detectors (ODs) with various architectures have achieved significant success in complex scenarios like autonomous driving. Previous adversarial attacks against ODs have been focused on designing customized attacks targeting their specific structures (e.g., NMS and RPN), yielding some results but simultaneously constraining their scalability. Moreover, most efforts against ODs stem from image-level attacks originally designed for classification tasks, resulting in redundant computations and disturbances in object-irrelevant areas (e.g., background). Consequently, how to design a model-agnostic efficient attack to comprehensively evaluate the vulnerabilities of ODs remains challenging and unresolved. In this paper, we propose NumbOD, a brand-new spatial-frequency fusion attack against various ODs, aimed at disrupting object detection within images. We directly leverage the features output by the OD without relying on its internal structures to craft adversarial examples. Specifically, we first design a dual-track attack target selection strategy to select high-quality bounding boxes from OD outputs for targeting. Subsequently, we employ directional perturbations to shift and compress predicted boxes and change classification results to deceive ODs. Additionally, we focus on manipulating the high-frequency components of images to confuse ODs' attention on critical objects, thereby enhancing the attack efficiency. Our extensive experiments on nine ODs and two datasets show that NumbOD achieves powerful attack performance and high stealthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Spatial feature regularization, effective in traditional methods, remains underexplored in DL-based approaches. Our study integrates spatial feature regularization into DL-based Array-SAR reconstruction, addressing key questions: What spatial features are relevant in urban-area mapping? How can these features be effectively described, modeled, regularized, and incorporated into DL networks? The study comprises five phases: spatial feature description and modeling, regularization, feature-enhanced network design, evaluation, and discussions. Sharp edges and geometric shapes in urban scenes are analyzed as key features. An intra-slice and inter-slice strategy is proposed, using 2D slices as reconstruction units and fusing them into 3D scenes through parallel and serial fusion. Two computational frameworks-iterative reconstruction with enhancement and light reconstruction with enhancement-are designed, incorporating spatial feature modules into DL networks, leading to four specialized reconstruction networks. Using our urban building simulation dataset and two public datasets, six tests evaluate close-point resolution, structural integrity, and robustness in urban scenarios. Results show that spatial feature regularization significantly improves reconstruction accuracy, retrieves more complete building structures, and enhances robustness by reducing noise and outliers.</p></details> |  |
| **[STKDRec: Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Distillation for Takeaway Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16502v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The takeaway recommendation system is designed to recommend users' future takeaway purchases based on their historical purchase behaviors, thereby improving user satisfaction and increasing merchant sales. Existing methods focus on incorporating auxiliary information or leveraging knowledge graphs to alleviate the sparsity issue of user purchase sequence data. However, two main challenges limit the performance of these approaches: (1) how to capture dynamic user preferences on complex geospatial information and (2) how to efficiently integrate spatial-temporal knowledge from graphs and sequence data with low calculation costs. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal knowledge distillation for takeaway recommendation model (STKDRec) based on the two-stage training process. Specifically, during the first pre-training stage, a spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) encoder is pre-trained to extract the high-order spatial-temporal and collaborative associations within the STKG. During the second STKD stage, a spatial-temporal Transformer is employed to comprehensively model dynamic user preferences on various types of fine-grained geospatial information from a sequence perspective. Furthermore, the STKD strategy is introduced to adaptively fuse the rich spatial-temporal knowledge from the pre-trained STKG encoder and the spatial-temporal transformer while reducing the cost of model training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our STKDRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

However, generalized model-based uncertainty estimation for spatial aggregates requires computationally expensive processes like iterative bootstrapping and computing pixel covariances. Uncertainty estimation for map subregions is critical for enhancing practicality and eventual adoption of model-based data products, as this capability would empower users to produce estimates at scales most germane to management: individual forest stands and ownership parcels. In this study we produced estimates of standard error (SE) associated with spatial averages of AGB predictions for ownership parcels in New York State (NYS). This represents the first model-based uncertainty estimation study to include all four types of uncertainty (reference data, sample variability, residual variability, and auxiliary data), incorporate spatial autocorrelation of model residuals, and use methods compatible with algorithmic modeling. We found that uncertainty attributed to residual variance, largely resulting from spatial correlation of residuals, dominated all other sources for most parcels in the study. These results suggest that improvements to model accuracy will yield the greatest reductions to total uncertainty in regions like the northeastern and midwestern United States where forests are divided into smaller spatial units. Further, we demonstrated that log-log regression relating parcel characteristics (area, perimeter, AGB density, forest cover) to parcel-level SE can accurately estimate uncertainty for map subregions, thus providing a convenient means to empower map users. These findings support transparency in future regional-scale model-based forest carbon accounting and monitoring efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[A robust, scalable K-statistic for quantifying immune cell clustering in spatial proteomics data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08498v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial summary statistics based on point process theory are widely used to quantify the spatial organization of cell populations in single-cell spatial proteomics data. Among these, Ripley's $K$ is a popular metric for assessing whether cells are spatially clustered or are randomly dispersed. However, the key assumption of spatial homogeneity is frequently violated in spatial proteomics data, leading to overestimates of cell clustering and colocalization. To address this, we propose a novel $K$-based method, termed \textit{KAMP} (\textbf{K} adjustment by \textbf{A}nalytical \textbf{M}oments of the \textbf{P}ermutation distribution), for quantifying the spatial organization of cells in spatial proteomics samples. \textit{KAMP} leverages background cells in each sample along with a new closed-form representation of the first and second moments of the permutation distribution of Ripley's $K$ to estimate an empirical null model. Our method is robust to inhomogeneity, computationally efficient even in large datasets, and provides approximate $p$-values for testing spatial clustering and colocalization. Methodological developments are motivated by a spatial proteomics study of 103 women with ovarian cancer, where our analysis using \textit{KAMP} shows a positive association between immune cell clustering and overall patient survival. Notably, we also find evidence that using $K$ without correcting for sample inhomogeneity may bias hazard ratio estimates in downstream analyses. \textit{KAMP} completes this analysis in just 5 minutes, compared to 538 minutes for the only competing method that adequately addresses inhomogeneity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-supervised Spatial-Temporal Learner for Precipitation Nowcasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15917v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowcasting, the short-term prediction of weather, is essential for making timely and weather-dependent decisions. Specifically, precipitation nowcasting aims to predict precipitation at a local level within a 6-hour time frame. This task can be framed as a spatial-temporal sequence forecasting problem, where deep learning methods have been particularly effective. However, despite advancements in self-supervised learning, most successful methods for nowcasting remain fully supervised. Self-supervised learning is advantageous for pretraining models to learn representations without requiring extensive labeled data. In this work, we leverage the benefits of self-supervised learning and integrate it with spatial-temporal learning to develop a novel model, SpaT-SparK. SpaT-SparK comprises a CNN-based encoder-decoder structure pretrained with a masked image modeling (MIM) task and a translation network that captures temporal relationships among past and future precipitation maps in downstream tasks. We conducted experiments on the NL-50 dataset to evaluate the performance of SpaT-SparK. The results demonstrate that SpaT-SparK outperforms existing baseline supervised models, such as SmaAt-UNet, providing more accurate nowcasting predictions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

We propose a robust path following scheme for the construction of smooth spatial motions by exploiting PH spline curves. In order to cover a general configuration setting, we present a guidance law which is suitable both for fully-actuated and (more common) under-actuated vehicles, which cannot control all the degrees of freedom. The robustness of the guidance law is enhanced by also taking into account the influence of wind or currents into the equations of motion. A selection of numerical experiments validates the effectiveness of the control strategy when $C^1$ spatial PH quintic interpolants are suitably considered for both kinematic and dynamic simulations.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Exploiting Multimodal Spatial-temporal Patterns for Video Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15691v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal tracking has garnered widespread attention as a result of its ability to effectively address the inherent limitations of traditional RGB tracking. However, existing multimodal trackers mainly focus on the fusion and enhancement of spatial features or merely leverage the sparse temporal relationships between video frames. These approaches do not fully exploit the temporal correlations in multimodal videos, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes and motion information of targets in complex scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose a unified multimodal spatial-temporal tracking approach named STTrack. In contrast to previous paradigms that solely relied on updating reference information, we introduced a temporal state generator (TSG) that continuously generates a sequence of tokens containing multimodal temporal information. These temporal information tokens are used to guide the localization of the target in the next time state, establish long-range contextual relationships between video frames, and capture the temporal trajectory of the target. Furthermore, at the spatial level, we introduced the mamba fusion and background suppression interactive (BSI) modules. These modules establish a dual-stage mechanism for coordinating information interaction and fusion between modalities. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets illustrate that STTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multimodal tracking scenarios.

| **[Mask-RadarNet: Enhancing Transformer With Spatial-Temporal Semantic Context for Radar Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15595v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a cost-effective and robust technology, automotive radar has seen steady improvement during the last years, making it an appealing complement to commonly used sensors like camera and LiDAR in autonomous driving. Radio frequency data with rich semantic information are attracting more and more attention. Most current radar-based models take radio frequency image sequences as the input. However, these models heavily rely on convolutional neural networks and leave out the spatial-temporal semantic context during the encoding stage. To solve these problems, we propose a model called Mask-RadarNet to fully utilize the hierarchical semantic features from the input radar data. Mask-RadarNet exploits the combination of interleaved convolution and attention operations to replace the traditional architecture in transformer-based models. In addition, patch shift is introduced to the Mask-RadarNet for efficient spatial-temporal feature learning. By shifting part of patches with a specific mosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, Mask-RadarNet achieves competitive performance while reducing the computational burden of the spatial-temporal modeling. In order to capture the spatial-temporal semantic contextual information, we design the class masking attention module (CMAM) in our encoder. Moreover, a lightweight auxiliary decoder is added to our model to aggregate prior maps generated from the CMAM. Experiments on the CRUW dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to some state-of-the-art radar-based object detection algorithms. With relatively lower computational complexity and fewer parameters, the proposed Mask-RadarNet achieves higher recognition accuracy for object detection in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2OST: Many-to-one Regression for Predicting Spatial Transcriptomics from Digital Pathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15092v4)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) has facilitated the spatially-aware profiling of gene expressions based on histopathology images. Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones along with patch-sampling for this task, which ignores the inherent multi-scale information embedded in the pyramidal data structure of digital pathology images, and wastes the inter-spot visual information crucial for accurate gene expression prediction. To address these limitations, we propose M2OST, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images via a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Unlike traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2OST uses multiple images from different levels of the digital pathology image to jointly predict the gene expressions in their common corresponding spot. Built upon our many-to-one scheme, M2OST can be easily scaled to fit different numbers of inputs, and its network structure inherently incorporates nearby inter-spot features, enhancing regression performance. We have tested M2OST on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2OST can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs).</p></details> | <details><summary>Impro...</summary><p>Improved from our previous unpublished work arXiv:2401.10608. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.10608</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Clustering of Citizen Science Data Improves Downstream Species Distribution Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15559v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citizen science biodiversity data present great opportunities for ecology and conservation across vast spatial and temporal scales. However, the opportunistic nature of these data lacks the sampling structure required by modeling methodologies that address a pervasive challenge in ecological data collection: imperfect detection, i.e., the likelihood of under-observing species on field surveys. Occupancy modeling is an example of an approach that accounts for imperfect detection by explicitly modeling the observation process separately from the biological process of habitat selection. This produces species distribution models that speak to the pattern of the species on a landscape after accounting for imperfect detection in the data, rather than the pattern of species observations corrupted by errors. To achieve this benefit, occupancy models require multiple surveys of a site across which the site's status (i.e., occupied or not) is assumed constant. Since citizen science data are not collected under the required repeated-visit protocol, observations may be grouped into sites post hoc. Existing approaches for constructing sites discard some observations and/or consider only geographic distance and not environmental similarity. In this study, we compare ten approaches for site construction in terms of their impact on downstream species distribution models for 31 bird species in Oregon, using observations recorded in the eBird database. We find that occupancy models built on sites constructed by spatial clustering algorithms perform better than existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |

Second, a dynamic camera positioning that extracts features for each proposal. Third, a language-informed spatial attention module that better reasons over the proposals to output the final prediction.

Research on short-term prediction and optimization methods has improved operations and fleet control of car-sharing services; however, long-term projections and spatial analysis are sparse in the literature. We propose to analyze the average monthly demand in a station-based car-sharing service with spatially-aware learning algorithms that offer high predictive performance as well as interpretability. Our study utilizes a rich set of socio-demographic, location-based (e.g., POIs), and car-sharing-specific features as input, extracted from a large proprietary car-sharing dataset and publicly available datasets. We first compare the performance of different modeling approaches and find that a global Random Forest with geo-coordinates as part of input features achieves the highest predictive performance with an R-squared score of 0.87 on test data. While a local linear model, Geographically Weighted Regression, performs almost on par in terms of out-of-sample prediction accuracy. We further leverage the models to identify spatial and socio-demographic drivers of car-sharing demand. An analysis of the Random Forest via SHAP values, as well as the coefficients of GWR and MGWR models, reveals that besides population density and the car-sharing supply, other spatial features such as surrounding POIs play a major role. In addition, MGWR yields exciting insights into the multiscale heterogeneous spatial distributions of factors influencing car-sharing behaviour. Together, our study offers insights for selecting effective and interpretable methods for diagnosing and planning the placement of car-sharing stations.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |

Under climate change, accurately predicting drought is critical for mitigating drought-induced risks. However, the intricate interplay among the physical and biological drivers that regulate droughts limits the predictability and understanding of drought, particularly at a subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scale. While deep learning has been demonstrated with potential in addressing climate forecasting challenges, its application to drought prediction has received relatively less attention. In this work, we propose a new dataset, DroughtSet, which integrates relevant predictive features and three drought indices from multiple remote sensing and reanalysis datasets across the contiguous United States (CONUS). DroughtSet specifically provides the machine learning community with a new real-world dataset to benchmark drought prediction models and more generally, time-series forecasting methods. Furthermore, we propose a spatial-temporal model SPDrought to predict and interpret S2S droughts. Our model learns from the spatial and temporal information of physical and biological features to predict three types of droughts simultaneously. Multiple strategies are employed to quantify the importance of physical and biological features for drought prediction. Our results provide insights for researchers to better understand the predictability and sensitivity of drought to biological and physical conditions. We aim to contribute to the climate field by proposing a new tool to predict and understand the occurrence of droughts and provide the AI community with a new benchmark to study deep learning applications in climate science.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |

Recent advances based on diffusion models typically rely on separate networks for reference appearance feature extraction and target visual generation, leading to inconsistent domain gaps between references and targets. In this paper, we frame the task as a spatially-conditioned inpainting problem, where the target image is inpainted to maintain appearance consistency with the reference. This approach enables the reference features to guide the generation of pose-compliant targets within a unified denoising network, thereby mitigating domain gaps. Additionally, to better maintain the reference appearance information, we impose a causal feature interaction framework, in which reference features can only query from themselves, while target features can query appearance information from both the reference and the target. To further enhance computational efficiency and flexibility, in practical implementation, we decompose the spatially-conditioned generation process into two stages: reference appearance extraction and conditioned target generation. Both stages share a single denoising network, with interactions restricted to self-attention layers. This proposed method ensures flexible control over the appearance of generated human images and videos. By fine-tuning existing base diffusion models on human video data, our method demonstrates strong generalization to unseen human identities and poses without requiring additional per-instance fine-tuning. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, showing competitive performance compared to existing methods for consistent human image and video synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ljzycmd/SCD</p></details> |

However, in spatial networks, where community structures are not random but constrained by physical and geographical factors, the effect of these structures on the robustness is unclear. This paper investigates the emergence of local communities in road and communication networks, whose nodes are located by population data of major urban areas in Japan, and connected shortly with low cost. We show that, as the strength of community increases, the spatial networks become more vulnerable to both intentional attacks and random failures. As an application point of view, this result suggests that the densely setting nodes of equipments should be avoided under short links in constructing a spatial network. These findings contribute to understanding the important relation between local communities and the robustness of connectivity against attacks and disasters especially in spatial networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 12 figures in main body, 142 pages in total include appendix</p></details> |

However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid responses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work introduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution (DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume dispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the temporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in complex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement module (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM predictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the DST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of three-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally, the model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions through the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving prediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of PM2.5 via Spatial-Diffusion guided Encoder-Decoder Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13935v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problem settings that require spatio-temporal forecasting, the values in the time-series not only exhibit spatio-temporal correlations but are also influenced by spatial diffusion across locations. One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |

More flexible spatial extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this paper, we aim to push the boundaries on computation and modeling of high-dimensional spatial extremes via integrating a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and non-stationary dependence properties in the encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder called the XVAE. The XVAE can emulate spatial observations and produce outputs that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the tail. Our approach also provides a novel way of making fast inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than traditional Bayesian inference while outperforming many spatial extremes models with a stationary dependence structure. Lastly, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We demonstrate how to use XVAE to identify regions susceptible to marine heatwaves under climate change and examine the spatial and temporal variability of the extremal dependence structure.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |

Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, with a 26.6% decrease of FID on HumanML3D and a 29.9% decrease on KIT-ML.

Despite significant advancements, most models still struggle with accurate spatial positioning of objects to be grasped. We first show that this spatial generalization challenge stems primarily from the extensive data requirements for adequate spatial understanding. However, collecting such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data often leads to visual generalization gaps upon deployment. To overcome these challenges, we then focus on state-based policy generalization and present \textbf{ManiBox}, a novel bounding-box-guided manipulation method built on a simulation-based teacher-student framework. The teacher policy efficiently generates scalable simulation data using bounding boxes, which are proven to uniquely determine the objects' spatial positions. The student policy then utilizes these low-dimensional spatial states to enable zero-shot transfer to real robots. Through comprehensive evaluations in simulated and real-world environments, ManiBox demonstrates a marked improvement in spatial grasping generalization and adaptability to diverse objects and backgrounds. Further, our empirical study into scaling laws for policy performance indicates that spatial volume generalization scales with data volume in a power law. For a certain level of spatial volume, the success rate of grasping empirically follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to data volume, showing a saturation effect as data increases. Our videos and code are available in https://thkkk.github.io/manibox.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, the so-called spatial omics are a family of techniques that generate biological information in a spatial domain, for instance, in the volume of a tissue. In this survey, we are mostly interested in the intersection between sc and spatial (scs) omics and in the challenges and opportunities that this new type of data pose for downstream data analysis methodologies. Our goal is to cover all major omics modalities, including transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, proteomics and metabolomics.</p></details> |  |

The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.

Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.

While recent advancements in generative models have been successful in video generation, they often overlook the spatial alignment between audio and visuals, which is essential for immersive experiences. To tackle this problem, we establish a new research direction in benchmarking Spatially Aligned Audio-Video Generation (SAVG). We propose three key components for the benchmark: dataset, baseline, and metrics. We introduce a spatially aligned audio-visual dataset, derived from an audio-visual dataset consisting of multichannel audio, video, and spatiotemporal annotations of sound events. We propose a baseline audio-visual diffusion model focused on stereo audio-visual joint learning to accommodate spatial sound. Finally, we present metrics to evaluate video and spatial audio quality, including a new spatial audio-visual alignment metric. Our experimental result demonstrates that gaps exist between the baseline model and ground truth in terms of video and audio quality, and spatial alignment between both modalities.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception (ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine (SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 4.2% and 13.1%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.</p></details> | AAAI2025 Accepted |

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMPaSS: Enhancing Spatial Understanding in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13195v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating photorealistic images, but commonly struggle to render accurate spatial relationships described in text prompts. We identify two core issues underlying this common failure: 1) the ambiguous nature of spatial-related data in existing datasets, and 2) the inability of current text encoders to accurately interpret the spatial semantics of input descriptions. We address these issues with CoMPaSS, a versatile training framework that enhances spatial understanding of any T2I diffusion model. CoMPaSS solves the ambiguity of spatial-related data with the Spatial Constraints-Oriented Pairing (SCOP) data engine, which curates spatially-accurate training data through a set of principled spatial constraints. To better exploit the curated high-quality spatial priors, CoMPaSS further introduces a Token ENcoding ORdering (TENOR) module to allow better exploitation of high-quality spatial priors, effectively compensating for the shortcoming of text encoders. Extensive experiments on four popular open-weight T2I diffusion models covering both UNet- and MMDiT-based architectures demonstrate the effectiveness of CoMPaSS by setting new state-of-the-arts with substantial relative gains across well-known benchmarks on spatial relationships generation, including VISOR (+98%), T2I-CompBench Spatial (+67%), and GenEval Position (+131%).

However, prevalent approaches primarily rely on extensive labeled data and computationally intensive voxel-based modeling, restricting the scalability and generalizability of 3D representation learning. In this paper, we introduce GaussTR, a novel Gaussian Transformer that leverages alignment with foundation models to advance self-supervised 3D spatial understanding. GaussTR adopts a Transformer architecture to predict sparse sets of 3D Gaussians that represent scenes in a feed-forward manner. Through aligning rendered Gaussian features with diverse knowledge from pre-trained foundation models, GaussTR facilitates the learning of versatile 3D representations and enables open-vocabulary occupancy prediction without explicit annotations. Empirical evaluations on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset showcase GaussTR's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, achieving 11.70 mIoU while reducing training duration by approximately 50%. These experimental results highlight the significant potential of GaussTR for scalable and holistic 3D spatial understanding, with promising implications for autonomous driving and embodied agents.

In some areas, like Baltimore, Maryland, there are only few regulatory (reference) devices but multiple low-cost networks. While there are many available methods to calibrate data from each network individually, separate calibration of each network leads to conflicting air quality predictions. We develop a general Bayesian spatial filtering model combining data from multiple networks and reference devices, providing dynamic calibrations (informed by the latest reference data) and unified predictions (combining information from all available sensors) for the entire region. This method accounts for network-specific bias and noise (observation models), as different networks can use different types of sensors, and uses a Gaussian process (state-space model) to capture spatial correlations. We apply the method to calibrate PM$_{2.5}$ data from Baltimore in June and July 2023 -- a period including days of hazardous concentrations due to wildfire smoke. Our method helps mitigate the effects of preferential sampling of one network in Baltimore, results in better predictions and narrower confidence intervals. Our approach can be used to calibrate low-cost air pollution sensor data in Baltimore and any other areas with multiple low-cost networks.</p></details> |  |

Visual Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate strong scene understanding and planning capabilities but lack the ability to generate actionable policies tailored to specific robotic embodiments. To address this, Visual-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged, yet they face challenges in long-horizon spatial reasoning and grounded task planning. In this work, we propose the Embodied Multimodal Action Model with Grounded Chain of Thought and Look-ahead Spatial Reasoning, Emma-X. Emma-X leverages our constructed hierarchical embodiment dataset based on BridgeV2, containing 60,000 robot manipulation trajectories auto-annotated with grounded task reasoning and spatial guidance.

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Left Ventricular Cavity Segmentation via Deep Spatial Sequential Network in 4D Computed Tomography Studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12853v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated segmentation of left ventricular cavity (LVC) in temporal cardiac image sequences (multiple time points) is a fundamental requirement for quantitative analysis of its structural and functional changes. Deep learning based methods for the segmentation of LVC are the state of the art; however, these methods are generally formulated to work on single time points, and fails to exploit the complementary information from the temporal image sequences that can aid in segmentation accuracy and consistency among the images across the time points. Furthermore, these segmentation methods perform poorly in segmenting the end-systole (ES) phase images, where the left ventricle deforms to the smallest irregular shape, and the boundary between the blood chamber and myocardium becomes inconspicuous. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new method to automatically segment temporal cardiac images where we introduce a spatial sequential (SS) network to learn the deformation and motion characteristics of the LVC in an unsupervised manner; these characteristics were then integrated with sequential context information derived from bi-directional learning (BL) where both chronological and reverse-chronological directions of the image sequence were used. Our experimental results on a cardiac computed tomography (CT) dataset demonstrated that our spatial-sequential network with bi-directional learning (SS-BL) method outperformed existing methods for LVC segmentation. Our method was also applied to MRI cardiac dataset and the results demonstrated the generalizability of our method.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Attackers can easily create radio interference to overshadow legitimate signals, leading to denial of service. The broadcast nature of radio signal propagation makes such attacks possible in the first place, but at the same time poses a challenge for the attacker: The jamming signal does not only reach the victim device but also other neighboring devices, preventing precise attack targeting. In this work, we solve this challenge by leveraging the emerging RIS technology, for the first time, for precise delivery of jamming signals. In particular, we propose a novel approach that allows for environment-adaptive spatial control of wireless jamming signals, granting a new degree of freedom to perform jamming attacks. We explore this novel method with extensive experimentation and demonstrate that our approach can disable the wireless communication of one or multiple victim devices while leaving neighboring devices unaffected. Notably, our method extends to challenging scenarios where wireless devices are very close to each other: We demonstrate complete denial-of-service of a Wi-Fi device while a second device located at a distance as close as 5 mm remains unaffected, sustaining wireless communication at a data rate of 25 Mbit/s. Lastly, we conclude by proposing potential countermeasures to thwart RIS-based spatial domain wireless jamming attacks.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we develop SPHERE (Spatial Perception and Hierarchical Evaluation of REasoning), a hierarchical evaluation framework with a new human-annotated dataset to pinpoint model strengths and weaknesses, advancing from single-skill tasks to multi-skill tasks, and ultimately to complex reasoning tasks that require the integration of multiple spatial and visual cues with logical reasoning. Benchmark evaluation of state-of-the-art open-source models reveal significant shortcomings, especially in the abilities to understand distance and proximity, to reason from both allocentric and egocentric viewpoints, and to perform complex reasoning in a physical context. This work underscores the need for more advanced approaches to spatial understanding and reasoning, paving the way for improvements in vision-language models and their alignment with human-like spatial capabilities.

| **[Structural Pruning via Spatial-aware Information Redundancy for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12672v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, semantic segmentation has flourished in various applications. However, the high computational cost remains a significant challenge that hinders its further adoption. The filter pruning method for structured network slimming offers a direct and effective solution for the reduction of segmentation networks. Nevertheless, we argue that most existing pruning methods, originally designed for image classification, overlook the fact that segmentation is a location-sensitive task, which consequently leads to their suboptimal performance when applied to segmentation networks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach, denoted as Spatial-aware Information Redundancy Filter Pruning~(SIRFP), which aims to reduce feature redundancy between channels. First, we formulate the pruning process as a maximum edge weight clique problem~(MEWCP) in graph theory, thereby minimizing the redundancy among the remaining features after pruning. Within this framework, we introduce a spatial-aware redundancy metric based on feature maps, thus endowing the pruning process with location sensitivity to better adapt to pruning segmentation networks. Additionally, based on the MEWCP, we propose a low computational complexity greedy strategy to solve this NP-hard problem, making it feasible and efficient for structured pruning. To validate the effectiveness of our method, we conducted extensive comparative experiments on various challenging datasets. The results demonstrate the superior performance of SIRFP for semantic segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Our goal is to boost tokenizers' compression ratio while maintaining reconstruction fidelity in the VQ-VAE paradigm. Firstly, to obtain compact latent representations, we decouple images or videos into spatial-temporal dimensions, translating visual information into learnable querying spatial and temporal tokens through a \textbf{C}ross-attention \textbf{Q}uery \textbf{A}uto\textbf{E}ncoder (CQAE). Secondly, to complement visual information during compression, we quantize these tokens via a specialized codebook derived from off-the-shelf LLM embeddings to leverage the rich semantics from language modality. Finally, to enhance training stability and convergence, we also introduce a curriculum learning strategy, which proves critical for effective discrete visual representation learning. SweetTokenizer achieves comparable video reconstruction fidelity with only \textbf{25\%} of the tokens used in previous state-of-the-art video tokenizers, and boost video generation results by \textbf{32.9\%} w.r.t gFVD. When using the same token number, we significantly improves video and image reconstruction results by \textbf{57.1\%} w.r.t rFVD on UCF-101 and \textbf{37.2\%} w.r.t rFID on ImageNet-1K. Additionally, the compressed tokens are imbued with semantic information, enabling few-shot recognition capabilities powered by LLMs in downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

The challenge of this task lies in understanding the spatial environment from the image. Many attempts have been made to extract global spatial visual information from the RGB space of an spatial image. However, local and depth image information are crucial for understanding the spatial environment, which previous works have ignored. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-modal and multi-scale spatial environment understanding scheme to achieve immersive VTTS, termed M2SE-VTTS. The multi-modal aims to take both the RGB and Depth spaces of the spatial image to learn more comprehensive spatial information, and the multi-scale seeks to model the local and global spatial knowledge simultaneously. Specifically, we first split the RGB and Depth images into patches and adopt the Gemini-generated environment captions to guide the local spatial understanding. After that, the multi-modal and multi-scale features are integrated by the local-aware global spatial understanding. In this way, M2SE-VTTS effectively models the interactions between local and global spatial contexts in the multi-modal spatial environment. Objective and subjective evaluations suggest that our model outperforms the advanced baselines in environmental speech generation. The code and audio samples are available at: https://github.com/AI-S2-Lab/M2SE-VTTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages,2 figures, Accepted by AAAI'2025</p></details> |

Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to extract meaningful insights from this data. However, in real-world applications, most nodes may not possess any available temporal data during training. For example, the pandemic dynamics of most cities on a geographical graph may not be available due to the asynchronous nature of outbreaks. Such a phenomenon disagrees with the training requirements of most existing spatial-temporal forecasting methods, which jeopardizes their effectiveness and thus blocks broader deployment. In this paper, we propose to formulate a novel problem of inductive forecasting with limited training data. In particular, given a spatial-temporal graph, we aim to learn a spatial-temporal forecasting model that can be easily generalized onto those nodes without any available temporal training data. To handle this problem, we propose a principled framework named ST-FiT. ST-FiT consists of two key learning components: temporal data augmentation and spatial graph topology learning. With such a design, ST-FiT can be used on top of any existing STGNNs to achieve superior performance on the nodes without training data. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of ST-FiT in multiple key perspectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inside-out cross-covariance for spatial multivariate data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12407v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the spatial features of multivariate data are increasingly central in researchers' applied problems, there is a growing demand for novel spatially-aware methods that are flexible, easily interpretable, and scalable to large data. We develop inside-out cross-covariance (IOX) models for multivariate spatial likelihood-based inference. IOX leads to valid cross-covariance matrix functions which we interpret as inducing spatial dependence on independent replicates of a correlated random vector. The resulting sample cross-covariance matrices are "inside-out" relative to the ubiquitous linear model of coregionalization (LMC). However, unlike LMCs, our methods offer direct marginal inference, easy prior elicitation of covariance parameters, the ability to model outcomes with unequal smoothness, and flexible dimension reduction. As a covariance model for a q-variate Gaussian process, IOX leads to scalable models for noisy vector data as well as flexible latent models. For large n cases, IOX complements Vecchia approximations and related process-based methods based on sparse graphical models. We demonstrate superior performance of IOX on synthetic datasets as well as on colorectal cancer proteomics data.

| **[Efficient Bayesian inversion for simultaneous estimation of geometry and spatial field using the Karhunen-Loève expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11610v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detection of abrupt spatial changes in physical properties representing unique geometric features such as buried objects, cavities, and fractures is an important problem in geophysics and many engineering disciplines. In this context, simultaneous spatial field and geometry estimation methods that explicitly parameterize the background spatial field and the geometry of the embedded anomalies are of great interest. This paper introduces an advanced inversion procedure for simultaneous estimation using the domain independence property of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve (K-L) expansion. Previous methods pursuing this strategy face significant computational challenges. The associated integral eigenvalue problem (IEVP) needs to be solved repeatedly on evolving domains, and the shape derivatives in gradient-based algorithms require costly computations of the Moore-Penrose inverse. Leveraging the domain independence property of the K-L expansion, the proposed method avoids both of these bottlenecks, and the IEVP is solved only once on a fixed bounding domain. Comparative studies demonstrate that our approach yields two orders of magnitude improvement in K-L expansion gradient computation time. Inversion studies on one-dimensional and two-dimensional seepage flow problems highlight the benefits of incorporating geometry parameters along with spatial field parameters. The proposed method captures abrupt changes in hydraulic conductivity with a lower number of parameters and provides accurate estimates of boundary and spatial-field uncertainties, outperforming spatial-field-only estimation methods.</p></details> |  |

Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</p></details> |  |

There is a bottleneck in scalable computation for general scientific use as the existing solutions require high-performance computing domain knowledge and are tailored for specific use cases. This study presents an R package `chopin` to reduce the technical burden for parallelization in geocomputation. Supporting popular spatial analysis packages in R, `chopin` leverages parallel computing by partitioning data that are involved in a computation task. The partitioning is implemented at regular grids, data hierarchies, and multiple file inputs with flexible input types for interoperability between different packages and efficiency. This approach makes the geospatial covariate calculation to the scale of the available processing power in a wide range of computing assets from laptop computers to high-performance computing infrastructure. Testing use cases in environmental exposure assessment demonstrated that the package reduced the execution time by order of processing units used. The work is expected to provide broader research communities using geospatial data with an efficient tool to process large scale data.</p></details> |  |

Current contact tracing methods range from interviews with public health personnel to Bluetooth pings from smartphones. While all methods offer various benefits, it is difficult for different methods to integrate with one another. Additionally, for contact tracing mobile applications, data privacy is a concern to many as GPS data from users is saved to either a central server or the user's device. The current paper describes a method called spatial cross-recurrence quantification analysis (SpaRQ) that can combine and analyze contact tracing data, regardless of how it has been obtained, and generate a risk profile for the user without storing GPS data. Furthermore, the plots from SpaRQ can be used to investigate the nature of the infectious agent, such as how long it can remain viable in air or on surfaces after an infected person has passed, the chance of infection based on exposure time, and what type of exposure is maximally infective.</p></details> | 15 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Uni-AdaFocus: Spatial-temporal Dynamic Computation for Video Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11228v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a comprehensive exploration of the phenomenon of data redundancy in video understanding, with the aim to improve computational efficiency. Our investigation commences with an examination of spatial redundancy, which refers to the observation that the most informative region in each video frame usually corresponds to a small image patch, whose shape, size and location shift smoothly across frames. Motivated by this phenomenon, we formulate the patch localization problem as a dynamic decision task, and introduce a spatially adaptive video recognition approach, termed AdaFocus. In specific, a lightweight encoder is first employed to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are then utilized by a policy network to identify the most task-relevant regions. Subsequently, the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity deep network for the final prediction. The full model can be trained in end-to-end conveniently. Furthermore, AdaFocus can be extended by further considering temporal and sample-wise redundancies, i.e., allocating the majority of computation to the most task-relevant frames, and minimizing the computation spent on relatively "easier" videos. Our resulting approach, Uni-AdaFocus, establishes a comprehensive framework that seamlessly integrates spatial, temporal, and sample-wise dynamic computation, while it preserves the merits of AdaFocus in terms of efficient end-to-end training and hardware friendliness. In addition, Uni-AdaFocus is general and flexible as it is compatible with off-the-shelf efficient backbones (e.g., TSM and X3D), which can be readily deployed as our feature extractor, yielding a significantly improved computational efficiency. Empirically, extensive experiments based on seven benchmark datasets and three application scenarios substantiate that Uni-AdaFocus is considerably more efficient than the competitive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI.

However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Electromagnetic Kernel Learning for Channel Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17414v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate channel prediction is essential for addressing channel aging caused by user mobility. However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an EIT-inspired Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel predictor with improved performance.

| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning for Spatio-Temporal Fusion in Land Surface Temperature Estimation: A Comprehensive Survey, Experimental Analysis, and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16631v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in satellite remote sensing have enhanced the capability to monitor and analyze the Earth's surface. Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and paves the way for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to the twin threats of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal in nature. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Global Spatio-Temporal Fusion-based Traffic Prediction Algorithm with Anomaly Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14569v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is an indispensable component of urban planning and traffic management. Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years.

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.

An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research. Recently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant sensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras producing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated samples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh samples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility of distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent representation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily linked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider physical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI for different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product kernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI, while for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and vary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different spatial topologies and sensor densities.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the development of TextVQA in image domain, existing Video TextVQA approaches leverage a language model (e.g. T5) to process text-rich multiple frames and generate answers auto-regressively. Nevertheless, the spatio-temporal relationships among visual entities (including scene text and objects) will be disrupted and models are susceptible to interference from unrelated information, resulting in irrational reasoning and inaccurate answering. To tackle these challenges, we propose the TEA (stands for ``\textbf{T}rack th\textbf{E} \textbf{A}nswer'') method that better extends the generative TextVQA framework from image to video. TEA recovers the spatio-temporal relationships in a complementary way and incorporates OCR-aware clues to enhance the quality of reasoning questions. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. TEA outperforms existing TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods and video large language models by great margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

So is statistics, the queen of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics, thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity. Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard. Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.</p></details> | An updated version |

However, the complex and dynamic nature of these correlations presents significant modeling challenges. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal dynamic hypergraph learning (STDHL) model. This model uses a hypergraph structure to represent spatial features among wind farms. Unlike traditional graph structures, which only capture pair-wise node features, hypergraphs create hyperedges connecting multiple nodes, enabling the representation and transmission of higher-order spatial features. The STDHL model incorporates a novel dynamic hypergraph convolutional layer to model dynamic spatial correlations and a grouped temporal convolutional layer for channel-independent temporal modeling. The model uses spatio-temporal encoders to extract features from multi-source covariates, which are mapped to quantile results through a forecast decoder. Experimental results using the GEFCom dataset show that the STDHL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis highlights the critical role of spatio-temporal covariates in improving ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted by the 39th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[B-VLLM: A Vision Large Language Model with Balanced Spatio-Temporal Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09919v1)** | 2024-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs) integrated with vision encoders have shown promising performance in vision understanding. The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

In particular, Saudi Arabia is gradually shifting its energy portfolio from an exclusive use of oil to a reliance on renewable energy, and, in particular, wind. Modeling wind for assessing potential energy output in a country as large, geographically diverse and understudied as Saudi Arabia is a challenge which implies highly non-linear dynamic structures in both space and time. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal model whose spatial information is first reduced via an energy distance-based approach and then its dynamical behavior is informed by a sparse and stochastic recurrent neural network (Echo State Network). Finally, the full spatial data is reconstructed by means of a non-stationary stochastic partial differential equation-based approach. Our model can capture the fine scale wind structure and produce more accurate forecasts of both wind speed and energy in lead times of interest for energy grid management and save annually as much as one million dollar against the closest competitive model.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we propose a novel spatio-temporal model using a strategic modification of the Hamiltonian equations, incorporating appropriate stochasticity via Gaussian processes. The resultant spatio-temporal process, continuously varying with time, turns out to be nonparametric, non-stationary, non-separable, and non-Gaussian. Additionally, the lagged correlations converge to zero as the spatio-temporal lag goes to infinity. We investigate the theoretical properties of the new spatio-temporal process, including its continuity and smoothness properties. We derive methods for complete Bayesian inference using MCMC techniques in the Bayesian paradigm. The performance of our method has been compared with that of a non-stationary Gaussian process (GP) using two simulation studies, where our method shows a significant improvement over the non-stationary GP. Further, applying our new model to two real data sets revealed encouraging performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Anoth...</summary><p>Another updated version, demonstrating superiority of our ideas over existing ones</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

| **[A Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning as an Alternative to Traditional Glosses in Sign Language Translation and Production](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02854v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenges associated with the use of glosses in both Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Production (SLP). While glosses have long been used as a bridge between sign language and spoken language, they come with two major limitations that impede the advancement of sign language systems. First, annotating the glosses is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits the scalability of datasets. Second, the glosses oversimplify sign language by stripping away its spatio-temporal dynamics, reducing complex signs to basic labels and missing the subtle movements essential for precise interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce Universal Gloss-level Representation (UniGloR), a framework designed to capture the spatio-temporal features inherent in sign language, providing a more dynamic and detailed alternative to the use of the glosses. The core idea of UniGloR is simple yet effective: We derive dense spatio-temporal representations from sign keypoint sequences using self-supervised learning and seamlessly integrate them into SLT and SLP tasks. Our experiments in a keypoint-based setting demonstrate that UniGloR either outperforms or matches the performance of previous SLT and SLP methods on two widely-used datasets: PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |

Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to accurately model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |

The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is published on Tomography</p></details> |

We are the first to propose a new benchmark for multi-person spatio-temporal complex activity localization, where complex semantic and long duration bring new challenges to localization tasks. We observe that limited atomic actions can be combined into many complex activities. MM-SEAL provides both atomic action and complex activity annotations, producing 111.7k atomic actions spanning 172 action categories and 17.7k complex activities spanning 200 activity categories. We explore the relationship between atomic actions and complex activities, finding that atomic action features can improve the complex activity localization performance. Also, we propose a new network which generates temporal proposals and labels simultaneously, termed Faster-TAD. Finally, our evaluations show that visual features pretrained on MM-SEAL can improve the performance on other action localization benchmarks. We will release the dataset and the project code upon publication of the paper.</p></details> | 17 pages,6 figures |

Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |

Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods. By effectively integrating river flow graphs with STGNNs, this research offers a novel approach to streamflow prediction, showcasing the potential of combining advanced neural network techniques with domain-specific knowledge for enhanced performance in hydrologic modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at IEEE Big Data 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods, which rely on either spatial SMPL(-X) poses or temporal embeddings, respectively suffer from coarse rendering quality or limited animation flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose GAST, a framework that unifies 3D human modeling with 3DGS by hierarchically integrating both spatial and temporal information. Specifically, we design a sequential conditioning framework for the non-rigid warping of the human body, under whose guidance more accurate 3D Gaussians can be obtained in the observation space. Moreover, the explicit properties of Gaussians allow us to embed richer sequential information, encompassing both the coarse sequence of human poses and finer per-vertex motion details. These sequence conditions are further sampled across different temporal scales, in a coarse-to-fine manner, ensuring unbiased inputs for non-rigid warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method combined with hierarchical spatio-temporal modeling surpasses concurrent baselines, delivering both high-quality rendering and flexible animating capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-aware Online Continual Learning for Urban Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15893v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal (ST) forecasting is crucial for various urban applications such as intelligent scheduling and trip planning. Previous studies focus on modeling ST correlations among urban locations in offline settings, which often neglect the non-stationary nature of urban ST data, particularly, distribution shifts over time. This oversight can lead to degraded performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first analyze the distribution shifts in urban ST data, and then introduce DOST, a novel online continual learning framework tailored for ST data characteristics. DOST employs an adaptive ST network equipped with a variable-independent adapter to address the unique distribution shifts at each urban location dynamically. Further, to accommodate the gradual nature of these shifts, we also develop an awake-hibernate learning strategy that intermittently fine-tunes the adapter during the online phase to reduce computational overhead. This strategy integrates a streaming memory update mechanism designed for urban ST sequential data, enabling effective network adaptation to new patterns while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results confirm DOST's superiority over state-of-the-art models on four real-world datasets, providing online forecasts within an average of 0.1 seconds and achieving a 12.89% reduction in forecast errors compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Weakly-supervised Video Instance Segmentation by Leveraging Spatio-temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16661v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks. However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-Cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data.

While the ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of these impacts, it lacks the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. ERA5 misses intense local rainfall events that are crucial drivers of devastating flooding - a critical limitation since extreme weather events become increasingly frequent. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 uses a conditional generative adversarial neural network (cGAN) that enhances the resolution of ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 hour to 2 km and 10 minutes, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to the challenges of downscaling. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia considering diverse climate zones, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization indicating a robust global applicability. SpateGAN-ERA5 fulfils a critical need for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research, offering new capabilities for flood risk assessment, AI-enhanced weather forecasting, and impact modelling to address climate-driven challenges worldwide.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on using spatio-temporal disease mapping models to explore the temporal trends of IHD at the county level from 1999 to 2021. To manage the computational burden arising from the high-dimensional data, we employ scalable Bayesian models using a "divide and conquer" strategy. This approach allows for fast model fitting and serves as an efficient procedure for screening spatio-temporal patterns. Additionally, we analyze trends in four regional subdivisions, West, Midwest, South and Northeast, and in urban and rural areas. The dataset on IHD contains missing data, and we propose a procedure to impute the omitted information. The results show a slowdown in the decrease of IHD mortality in the US after 2014 with a slight increase noted after 2019. However, differences exists among the counties, the four big geographical regions, and rural and urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.00140</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Representation Learning on Road Networks and Grids with Spatio-Temporal Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14014v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory representation learning is a fundamental task for applications in fields including smart city, and urban planning, as it facilitates the utilization of trajectory data (e.g., vehicle movements) for various downstream applications, such as trajectory similarity computation or travel time estimation. This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased and Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Anticipation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13059v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal Scene Graphs (STSGs) provide a concise and expressive representation of dynamic scenes by modelling objects and their evolving relationships over time. However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A Foundation Model for Unified Urban Spatio-Temporal Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12972v1)** | 2024-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal flow prediction, encompassing traffic flows and crowd flows, is crucial for optimizing city infrastructure and managing traffic and emergency responses. Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal Uncertainty Quantification for Distributed Energy Adoption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12193v1)** | 2024-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DER) has introduced significant spatio-temporal uncertainties in power grid management, necessitating accurate multilevel forecasting methods. However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

Effectively modeling these dynamics is essential for understanding and optimizing urban systems In this work, we introduce UrbanDiT, a foundation model for open-world urban spatio-temporal learning that successfully scale up diffusion transformers in this field. UrbanDiT pioneers a unified model that integrates diverse spatio-temporal data sources and types while learning universal spatio-temporal patterns across different cities and scenarios. This allows the model to unify both multi-data and multi-task learning, and effectively support a wide range of spatio-temporal applications. Its key innovation lies in the elaborated prompt learning framework, which adaptively generates both data-driven and task-specific prompts, guiding the model to deliver superior performance across various urban applications. UrbanDiT offers three primary advantages: 1) It unifies diverse data types, such as grid-based and graph-based data, into a sequential format, allowing to capture spatio-temporal dynamics across diverse scenarios of different cities; 2) With masking strategies and task-specific prompts, it supports a wide range of tasks, including bi-directional spatio-temporal prediction, temporal interpolation, spatial extrapolation, and spatio-temporal imputation; and 3) It generalizes effectively to open-world scenarios, with its powerful zero-shot capabilities outperforming nearly all baselines with training data. These features allow UrbanDiT to achieves state-of-the-art performance in different domains such as transportation traffic, crowd flows, taxi demand, bike usage, and cellular traffic, across multiple cities and tasks. UrbanDiT sets up a new benchmark for foundation models in the urban spatio-temporal domain.</p></details> |  |

This paper advances the analysis of such spatio-spherical data by developing convolutional network layers that are equivariant to the $\mathbf{E(3) \times SO(3)}$ group and account for the physical symmetries of dMRI including rotations, translations, and reflections of space alongside voxel-wise rotations. Further, neuronal fibers are typically antipodally symmetric, a fact we leverage to construct highly efficient spatio-hemispherical graph convolutions to accelerate the analysis of high-dimensional dMRI data. In the context of sparse spherical fiber deconvolution to recover white matter microstructure, our proposed equivariant network layers yield substantial performance and efficiency gains, leading to better and more practical resolution of crossing neuronal fibers and fiber tractography. These gains are experimentally consistent across both simulation and in vivo human datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024. 24 pages with 13 figures.

Existing thermal comfort models usually overlook temporal dynamics alongside spatial dependencies. We address this problem by introducing a spatio-temporal jump model that clusters data with persistence across both spatial and temporal dimensions. This framework enhances interpretability, minimizes abrupt state changes, and easily handles missing data. We validate our approach through extensive simulations, demonstrating its accuracy in recovering the true underlying partition. When applied to hourly environmental data gathered from a set of weather stations located across the city of Singapore, our proposal identifies meaningful thermal comfort regimes, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamic urban settings and suitability for real-world monitoring. The comparison of these regimes with feedback on thermal preference indicates the potential of an unsupervised approach to avoid extensive surveys.</p></details> |  |
| **[DemMamba: Alignment-free Raw Video Demoireing with Frequency-assisted Spatio-Temporal Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10679v2)** | 2024-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moire patterns, resulting from the interference of two similar repetitive patterns, are frequently observed during the capture of images or videos on screens. These patterns vary in color, shape, and location across video frames, posing challenges in extracting information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency throughout the restoration process. Existing deep learning methods often depend on well-designed alignment modules, such as optical flow estimation, deformable convolution, and cross-frame self-attention layers, incurring high computational costs. Recent studies indicate that utilizing raw data as input can significantly improve the effectiveness of video demoireing by providing the pristine degradation information and more detailed content. However, previous works fail to design both efficient and effective raw video demoireing methods that can maintain temporal consistency and prevent degradation of color and spatial details. This paper introduces a novel alignment-free raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). It features sequentially arranged Spatial Mamba Blocks (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Blocks (TMB) to effectively model the inter- and intra-relationships in raw videos affected by moire patterns. An Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) within the SMB facilitates demoireing in the frequency domain, while a Channel Attention Block (CAB) in the TMB enhances the temporal information interactions by leveraging inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art methods by 1.3 dB in PSNR, and also provides a satisfactory visual experience.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, which use recurrent neural networks to capture temporal patterns, have proven their effectiveness but come with high system complexity and computational demand. Convolutions could offer a more efficient alternative but are limited by their characteristic of treating all previous frames equally, resulting in poor temporal characterization, and by their local receptive field, limiting the capacity to capture distant correlations among frames. In this paper, we propose STLight, a novel method for spatio-temporal learning that relies solely on channel-wise and depth-wise convolutions as learnable layers. STLight overcomes the limitations of traditional convolutional approaches by rearranging spatial and temporal dimensions together, using a single convolution to mix both types of features into a comprehensive spatio-temporal patch representation. This representation is then processed in a purely convolutional framework, capable of focusing simultaneously on the interaction among near and distant patches, and subsequently allowing for efficient reconstruction of the predicted frames. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art performance on STL benchmarks across different datasets and settings, while significantly improving computational efficiency in terms of parameters and computational FLOPs.

Predicting these extreme events remains challenging, as their complex interactions with large-scale atmospheric and climatic variables are difficult to capture with traditional statistical and dynamical models. This work presents a general method for driver identification in extreme climate events. A novel framework (STCO-FS) is proposed to identify key immediate (short-term) HW drivers by combining clustering algorithms with an ensemble evolutionary algorithm. The framework analyzes spatio-temporal data, reduces dimensionality by grouping similar geographical nodes for each variable, and develops driver selection in spatial and temporal domains, identifying the best time lags between predictive variables and HW occurrences. The proposed method has been applied to analyze HWs in the Adda river basin in Italy. The approach effectively identifies significant variables influencing HWs in this region. This research can potentially enhance our understanding of HW drivers and predictability.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we apply these spatio-temporal compressors to standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed prime-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most of the existing models achieve either spectral or spatial compression, and do not jointly consider the spatio-spectral redundancies present in HSIs. To address this problem, in this paper we focus our attention on the High Fidelity Compression (HiFiC) model (which is proven to be highly effective for spatial compression problems) and adapt it to perform spatio-spectral compression of HSIs. In detail, we introduce two new models: i) HiFiC using Squeeze and Excitation (SE) blocks (denoted as HiFiC$_{SE}$); and ii) HiFiC with 3D convolutions (denoted as HiFiC$_{3D}$) in the framework of compression of HSIs. We analyze the effectiveness of HiFiC$_{SE}$ and HiFiC$_{3D}$ in compressing the spatio-spectral redundancies with channel attention and inter-dependency analysis. Experimental results show the efficacy of the proposed models in performing spatio-spectral compression, while reconstructing images at reduced bitrates with higher reconstruction quality.

To efficiently handle TkQs, many indexes have been developed, but the effectiveness of TkQ is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues and there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we consider embedding based spatial keyword queries, which capture the semantic meaning of query keywords and object descriptions in two separate embeddings to evaluate textual relevance. Although various models can be used to generate these embeddings, no indexes have been specifically designed for such queries. To fill this gap, we propose LIST, a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search index that Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data. LIST utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. There are two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index, i.e., the absence of high-quality labels and the unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Additionally, we introduce a learning based spatial relevance model that can integrates with various text relevance models to form a lightweight yet effective relevance for reranking objects retrieved by LIST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB Journal</p></details> |

Existing approaches often address these dimensions in isolation, neglecting their critical interdependencies. In this paper, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Unitized Model (STUM), a unified framework designed to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies while addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity through techniques such as distribution alignment and feature fusion. It also ensures both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Central to STUM is the Adaptive Spatio-temporal Unitized Cell (ASTUC), which utilizes low-rank matrices to seamlessly store, update, and interact with space, time, as well as their correlations. Our framework is also modular, allowing it to integrate with various spatio-temporal graph neural networks through components such as backbone models, feature extractors, residual fusion blocks, and predictive modules to collectively enhance forecasting outcomes. Experimental results across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that STUM consistently improves prediction performance with minimal computational cost. These findings are further supported by hyperparameter optimization, pre-training analysis, and result visualization. We provide our source code for reproducibility at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/STUM-E4F0.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often struggle to capture important spatio-temporal relationships, particularly overlooking global relations among distant city regions. Most existing techniques predominantly rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to capture global relations. However, CNNs exhibit neighbourhood bias, making them insufficient for capturing distant relations. To address this limitation, we propose ST-SampleNet, a novel transformer-based architecture that combines CNNs with self-attention mechanisms to capture both local and global relations effectively. Moreover, as the number of regions increases, the quadratic complexity of self-attention becomes a challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a lightweight region sampling strategy that prunes non-essential regions and enhances the efficiency of our approach. Furthermore, we introduce a spatially constrained position embedding that incorporates spatial neighbourhood information into the self-attention mechanism, aiding in semantic interpretation and improving the performance of ST-SampleNet. Our experimental evaluation on three real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of ST-SampleNet. Additionally, our efficient variant achieves a 40% reduction in computational costs with only a marginal compromise in performance, approximately 1%.</p></details> |  |

However, most current systems assume a static environment, which limits the system's applicability in real-world scenarios where environments frequently change due to human intervention or the robot's own actions. In this work, we present DynaMem, a new approach to open-world mobile manipulation that uses a dynamic spatio-semantic memory to represent a robot's environment. DynaMem constructs a 3D data structure to maintain a dynamic memory of point clouds, and answers open-vocabulary object localization queries using multimodal LLMs or open-vocabulary features generated by state-of-the-art vision-language models.

Yet, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on a specific task, thereby limiting their adaptability to new urban domains with varied task demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to remedy this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, the cross-task generalization still remains under-explored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning due to the lack of a unified framework. To bridge the gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-based framework capable of adapting to multi-diverse tasks in a data-scarce domain. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables capturing dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, facilitating the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three tasks-forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation-achieving an improvement of up to 10.7%.</p></details> |  |

While convolutional neural networks are widely used in learning ice layer patterns from raw echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors, noise in the echogram images prevents researchers from getting high-quality results. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch network can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods typically adopt dual-path networks to separately modeling spatial features and temporal features. However, the uncertain compatibility of the two networks brings a challenge for spatio-temporal features fusion and violate the spatio-temporal coherence and coupling of human motions by nature.

We then leverage hyperedges to bridge these nodes for exploring spatio-temporal features. This perspective considers spatio-temporal dynamics unitedly and reformulates multi-person motion prediction into a problem on a single graph.

| **[Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, are widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the complex, temporally dynamic nature of endoscopic scenes. This paper presents ST-Endo4DGS, a novel framework that models the spatio-temporal volume of dynamic endoscopic scenes using unbiased 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) primitives, parameterized by anisotropic ellipses with flexible 4D rotations. This approach enables precise representation of deformable tissue dynamics, capturing intricate spatial and temporal correlations in real time. Additionally, we extend spherindrical harmonics to represent time-evolving appearance, achieving realistic adaptations to lighting and view changes. A new endoscopic normal alignment constraint (ENAC) further enhances geometric fidelity by aligning rendered normals with depth-derived geometry. Extensive evaluations show that ST-Endo4DGS outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and real-time performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction for endoscopic surgery.</p></details> |  |

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency. This work sets a benchmark for tackling complex inference tasks with heterogeneous MTS, offering a versatile, interpretable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[STAA: Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution for Real-Time Interpreting Transformer-based Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00630v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, including image and video analysis. However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

| **[Continuous Spatio-Temporal Memory Networks for 4D Cardiac Cine MRI Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23191v2)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current cardiac cine magnetic resonance image (cMR) studies focus on the end diastole (ED) and end systole (ES) phases, while ignoring the abundant temporal information in the whole image sequence. This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

| **[STC-ViT: Spatio Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17966v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operational weather forecasting system relies on computationally expensive physics-based models. Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Hierarchical Framework with Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Emergence Detection in Complex Adaptive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10300v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Spatio-temporal encoders composed of spatial and temporal transformers are designed to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Agents' and the system's representations are learned to preserve the spatio-temporal consistency by minimizing the spatial and temporal dissimilarities in a self-supervised manner in the latent space. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic in incorporating other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |
| **[DeepMIDE: A Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Method for Ultra-Scale Offshore Wind Energy Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20166v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To unlock access to stronger winds, the offshore wind industry is advancing with significantly larger and taller wind turbines. This massive upscaling motivates a departure from univariate wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate, nonstationary, and state-dependent kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from future offshore wind energy sites in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting, and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated from a non-separable model with diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonomous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Spatio-temporal Estimation on the Graph Edges via Line Graph Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00656v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal estimation of signals on graph edges is challenging because most conventional Graph Signal Processing techniques are defined on the graph nodes. Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</p></details> |  |

Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf{8.3} \times$ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems for publication.

Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables, under review in Applied Ocean Research Journal</p></details> |

To make the cooperation safe for the humans involved, the systems have to follow protocols with rigid real-time and real-space properties, but they also need to be capable of making competitive and collaborative decisions with varying rewards and penalties. Due to these tough requirements, the construction of system control software is often very difficult. This calls for applying a model-based engineering approach, which allows one to formally express the time and space properties and use them as guidance for the whole engineering process from requirement definition via system design to software development. Moreover, it is beneficial, if one can verify with acceptable effort, that the time and space requirements are preserved throughout the development steps. This paper focuses on modelling spatio-temporal properties and their model-checking and simulation using different analysis tools in combination with the methods and tool extensions proposed here. To this end, we provide an informal overview of CASTeL, our CASTeLogic.

We present a comprehensive investigation of Graph U-Nets, originally developed for classification tasks, now tailored for mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal forecasting of fluid dynamics. Our focus is on enhancing their performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and architectural modifications. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%.

This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the occupancy rate from large-scale datasets to identify gaps between supply and demand in public transportation. Leveraging the spatio-temporal granularity of data from Automatic People Counting (APC) and relying on the Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model and the Generalized Mixed-Effect Random Forest, in this study we propose a methodology for analyzing factors determining undercrowding. The results of the model are examined at both the segment and ride levels. Initially, the analysis focuses on identifying segments more likely associated with undercrowding, understanding factors influencing the probability of undercrowding, and exploring their relationships. Subsequently, the analysis extends to the temporal distribution of undercrowding, encompassing its impact on the entire journey. The proposed methodology is applied to analyze APC data, provided by the company responsible for public transport management in Milan, on a radial route of the surface transportation network.</p></details> | Pre-print version |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |

Many approaches to estimate this rely on specific models, but the use of incorrect models can introduce uncontrolled errors. Here, we describe a model-free method that uses trajectory data directly to estimate the evidence for irreversibility over finite windows of time. To do this we build on previous work to identify and correct for errors that arise from limited sample size. Importantly, our approach accurately recovers $D_{KL} = 0$ in systems that adhere to detailed balance, and the correct nonzero $D_{KL}$ for data generated by well understood models of nonequilibrium systems. We apply our method to trajectories of neural activity in the retina as it responds to naturalistic inputs, and find evidence of irreversibility in single neurons, emphasizing the non-Markovian character of these data. These results open new avenues for investigating how the brain represents the arrow of time.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only aims to bolster existing algorithms by evaluating two distinct pretrained embeddings suited for ambient sensor activations but also introduces a novel hierarchical architecture. We delve into an architecture anchored on Transformer Decoder-based pre-trained embeddings, reminiscent of the GPT design, and contrast it with the previously established state-of-the-art (SOTA) ELMo embeddings for ambient sensors. Our proposed hierarchical structure leverages the strengths of each pre-trained embedding, enabling the discernment of activity dependencies and sequence order, thereby enhancing classification precision. To further refine recognition, we incorporate into our proposed architecture an hour-of-the-day embedding. Empirical evaluations underscore the preeminence of the Transformer Decoder embedding in classification endeavors. Additionally, our innovative hierarchical design significantly bolsters the efficacy of both pre-trained embeddings, notably in capturing inter-activity nuances. The integration of temporal aspects subtly but distinctively augments classification, especially for time-sensitive activities. In conclusion, our GPT-inspired hierarchical approach, infused with temporal insights, outshines the SOTA ELMo benchmark.</p></details> |  |

It has found applications in machine learning such as covariance functions for Gaussian processes. A strength of the underlying signature features is that they provide a structured global description of a time series. However, this property can quickly become a curse when local information is essential and forgetting is required; so far this has only been addressed with ad-hoc methods such as slicing the time series into subsegments. To overcome this, we propose a principled, data-driven approach by introducing a novel forgetting mechanism for signatures. This allows the model to dynamically adapt its context length to focus on more recent information. To achieve this, we revisit the recently introduced Random Fourier Signature Features, and develop Random Fourier Decayed Signature Features (RFDSF) with Gaussian processes (GPs). This results in a Bayesian time series forecasting algorithm with variational inference, that offers a scalable probabilistic algorithm that processes and transforms a time series into a joint predictive distribution over time steps in one pass using recurrence. For example, processing a sequence of length $10^4$ steps in $\approx 10^{-2}$ seconds and in $< 1\text{GB}$ of GPU memory. We demonstrate that it outperforms other GP-based alternatives and competes with state-of-the-art probabilistic time series forecasting algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Alignment Improves Test-Time Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07343v4)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent years have witnessed significant advancements in medical image segmentation, the pervasive issue of domain shift among medical images from diverse centres hinders the effective deployment of pre-trained models. Many Test-time Adaptation (TTA) methods have been proposed to address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained models with test data during inference. These methods, however, often suffer from less-satisfactory optimization due to suboptimal optimization direction (dictated by the gradient) and fixed step-size (predicated on the learning rate). In this paper, we propose the Gradient alignment-based Test-time adaptation (GraTa) method to improve both the gradient direction and learning rate in the optimization procedure. Unlike conventional TTA methods, which primarily optimize the pseudo gradient derived from a self-supervised objective, our method incorporates an auxiliary gradient with the pseudo one to facilitate gradient alignment. Such gradient alignment enables the model to excavate the similarities between different gradients and correct the gradient direction to approximate the empirical gradient related to the current segmentation task. Additionally, we design a dynamic learning rate based on the cosine similarity between the pseudo and auxiliary gradients, thereby empowering the adaptive fine-tuning of pre-trained models on diverse test data. Extensive experiments establish the effectiveness of the proposed gradient alignment and dynamic learning rate and substantiate the superiority of our GraTa method over other state-of-the-art TTA methods on a benchmark medical image segmentation task. The code and weights of pre-trained source models are available at https://github.com/Chen-Ziyang/GraTa.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Hybrid Technique for Plant Disease Identification and Localisation in Real-time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19682v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past decade, several image-processing methods and algorithms have been proposed for identifying plant diseases based on visual data. DNN (Deep Neural Networks) have recently become popular for this task. Both traditional image processing and DNN-based methods encounter significant performance issues in real-time detection owing to computational limitations and a broad spectrum of plant disease features. This article proposes a novel technique for identifying and localising plant disease based on the Quad-Tree decomposition of an image and feature learning simultaneously. The proposed algorithm significantly improves accuracy and faster convergence in high-resolution images with relatively low computational load. Hence it is ideal for deploying the algorithm in a standalone processor in a remotely operated image acquisition and disease detection system, ideally mounted on drones and robots working on large agricultural fields. The technique proposed in this article is hybrid as it exploits the advantages of traditional image processing methods and DNN-based models at different scales, resulting in faster inference. The F1 score is approximately 0.80 for four disease classes corresponding to potato and tomato crops.</p></details> |  |

Despite its popularity, the convergence behavior of SGDM remains less understood in nonconvex scenarios. This is primarily due to the absence of a sufficient descent property and challenges in simultaneously controlling the momentum and stochastic errors in an almost sure sense. To address these challenges, we investigate the behavior of SGDM over specific time windows, rather than examining the descent of consecutive iterates as in traditional studies. This time window-based approach simplifies the convergence analysis and enables us to establish the iterate convergence result for SGDM under the {\L}ojasiewicz property. We further provide local convergence rates which depend on the underlying {\L}ojasiewicz exponent and the utilized step size schemes.</p></details> | 23 pages |

One difference between the two systems is that, at the level of individual inference rules, PLN directly leverages both term and relationship probabilities, whereas NARS only leverages relationship frequencies and has no simple analogue of term probabilities. Thus we focus here on scenarios where there is high uncertainty about term probabilities, and explore how this uncertainty influences the comparative inferential conclusions of the two systems. We compare the product of strength and confidence ($s\times c$) in PLN against the product of frequency and confidence ($f\times c$) in NARS (quantities we refer to as measuring the "power" of an uncertain statement) in cases of high term probability uncertainty, using heuristic analyses and elementary numerical computations. We find that in many practical situations with high term probability uncertainty, PLN and NARS formulas give very similar results for the power of an inference conclusion, even though they sometimes come to these similar numbers in quite different ways.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time classification of EEG signals using Machine Learning deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19515v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevailing educational methods predominantly rely on traditional classroom instruction or online delivery, often limiting the teachers' ability to engage effectively with all the students simultaneously. A more intrinsic method of evaluating student attentiveness during lectures can enable the educators to tailor the course materials and their teaching styles in order to better meet the students' needs. The aim of this paper is to enhance teaching quality in real time, thereby fostering a higher student engagement in the classroom activities. By monitoring the students' electroencephalography (EEG) signals and employing machine learning algorithms, this study proposes a comprehensive solution for addressing this challenge. Machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for simplifying the analysis of complex variables, enabling the effective assessment of the students' concentration levels based on specific parameters. However, the real-time impact of machine learning models necessitates a careful consideration as their deployment is concerned. This study proposes a machine learning-based approach for predicting the level of students' comprehension with regard to a certain topic. A browser interface was introduced that accesses the values of the system's parameters to determine a student's level of concentration on a chosen topic. The deployment of the proposed system made it necessary to address the real-time challenges faced by the students, consider the system's cost, and establish trust in its efficacy. This paper presents the efforts made for approaching this pertinent issue through the implementation of innovative technologies and provides a framework for addressing key considerations for future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Romanian Journal of Information Technology and Automatic Control</p></details> |

Existing methods struggle with generating long, consistent video streams efficiently, often being limited by latency issues and degraded visual quality over extended periods. In this paper, we introduce RAIN, a pipeline solution capable of animating infinite video streams in real-time with low latency using a single RTX 4090 GPU. The core idea of RAIN is to efficiently compute frame-token attention across different noise levels and long time-intervals while simultaneously denoising a significantly larger number of frame-tokens than previous stream-based methods. This design allows RAIN to generate video frames with much shorter latency and faster speed, while maintaining long-range attention over extended video streams, resulting in enhanced continuity and consistency. Consequently, a Stable Diffusion model fine-tuned with RAIN in just a few epochs can produce video streams in real-time and low latency without much compromise in quality or consistency, up to infinite long. Despite its advanced capabilities, the RAIN only introduces a few additional 1D attention blocks, imposing minimal additional burden. Experiments in benchmark datasets and generating super-long videos demonstrating that RAIN can animate characters in real-time with much better quality, accuracy, and consistency than competitors while costing less latency. All code and models will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time Series Analysis of Assertions in the Linux Kernel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19465v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assertions are a classical and typical software development technique. These are extensively used also in operating systems and their kernels, including the Linux kernel. The paper patches a gap in existing knowledge by empirically examining the longitudinal evolution of assertion use in the Linux kernel. According to the results, the use of assertions that cause a kernel panic has slightly but not substantially decreased from the kernel's third to the sixth release series. At the same time, however, the use of softer assertion variants has increased; these do not cause a panic by default but instead produce warnings. With these time series results, the paper contributes to the existing but limited empirical knowledge base about operating system kernels and their long-term evolution.</p></details> | Submitted |
| **[A Prototype Unit for Image De-raining using Time-Lapse Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19459v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of single-image de-raining, a task that involves recovering rain-free background information from a single rain image. While recent advancements have utilized real-world time-lapse data for training, enabling the estimation of consistent backgrounds and realistic rain streaks, these methods often suffer from computational and memory consumption, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel solution: the Rain Streak Prototype Unit (RsPU). The RsPU efficiently encodes rain streak-relevant features as real-time prototypes derived from time-lapse data, eliminating the need for excessive memory resources. Our de-raining network combines encoder-decoder networks with the RsPU, allowing us to learn and encapsulate diverse rain streak-relevant features as concise prototypes, employing an attention-based approach. To ensure the effectiveness of our approach, we propose a feature prototype loss encompassing cohesion and divergence components. This loss function captures both the compactness and diversity aspects of the prototypical rain streak features within the RsPU. Our method evaluates various de-raining benchmarks, accompanied by comprehensive ablation studies. We show that it can achieve competitive results in various rain images compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by BMVC 2024</p></details> |

Although dimensionality reduction has traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in minimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been paid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to explore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is generally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt temporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However, our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying PCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also enhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal structure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within these windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical information. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal dimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference and reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and inference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%, without sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other reduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the efficiency of TSA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Its ability to amplify and resonate with the pilot's psyche enables real-time mental control, creating unique applications such as psychomagnetic fields and sensory-based weaponry. This paper presents the development of a novel robotic control system inspired by the Psycho Frame, combining electroencephalography (EEG) and deep learning for real-time control of robotic systems. By capturing and interpreting brainwave data through EEG, the system extends human cognitive commands to robotic actions, reflecting the seamless synchronization of thought and machine, much like the Psyco Frame's integration with a Newtype pilot's mental faculties. This research demonstrates how modern AI techniques can expand the limits of human-machine interaction, potentially transcending traditional input methods and enabling a deeper, more intuitive control of complex robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

To combat the Doppler shift induced by time-varying channels, each device adopts orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation. Our objective is minimizing the mean squared error (MSE) for the target function estimation. Due to the multipath time-varying channels, the OTFS-based AirComp not only suffers from noise but also interference. Specifically, we propose three schemes, namely S1, S2, and S3, for the target function estimation. S1 directly estimates the target function under the impacts of noise and interference. S2 mitigates the interference by introducing a zero padding-assisted OTFS. In S3, we propose an iterative algorithm to estimate the function in a matrix form. In the numerical results, we evaluate the performance of S1, S2, and S3 from the perspectives of MSE and computational complexity, and compare them with benchmarks. Specifically, compared to benchmarks, S3 outperforms them with a significantly lower MSE but incurs a higher computational complexity. In contrast, S2 demonstrates a reduction in both MSE and computational complexity. Lastly, S1 shows superior error performance at small SNR and reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.

| **[Pointwise-in-Time Explanation for Linear Temporal Logic Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13956v3)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The new field of Explainable Planning (XAIP) has produced a variety of approaches to explain and describe the behavior of autonomous agents to human observers. Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>See r...</summary><p>See related publication in Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2023</p></details> |

However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored, with growing concerns regarding their black-box nature, lack of interpretability and applicability. This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of TSFM in anomaly detection and prediction tasks. We systematically analyze TSFM across multiple datasets, including those characterized by the absence of discernible patterns, trends and seasonality. Our analysis shows that while TSFMs can be extended for anomaly detection and prediction, traditional statistical and deep learning models often match or outperform TSFM in these tasks.

| **[Graph Mixture of Experts and Memory-augmented Routers for Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19108v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection is a critical task that involves identifying abnormal patterns or events in data that consist of multiple interrelated time series. In order to better model the complex interdependence between entities and the various inherent characteristics of each entity, the GNN based methods are widely adopted by existing methods. In each layer of GNN, node features aggregate information from their neighboring nodes to update their information. In doing so, from shallow layer to deep layer in GNN, original individual node features continue to be weakened and more structural information,i.e., from short-distance neighborhood to long-distance neighborhood, continues to be enhanced. However, research to date has largely ignored the understanding of how hierarchical graph information is represented and their characteristics that can benefit anomaly detection. Existing methods simply leverage the output from the last layer of GNN for anomaly estimation while neglecting the essential information contained in the intermediate GNN layers. To address such limitations, in this paper, we propose a Graph Mixture of Experts (Graph-MoE) network for multivariate time series anomaly detection, which incorporates the mixture of experts (MoE) module to adaptively represent and integrate hierarchical multi-layer graph information into entity representations. It is worth noting that our Graph-MoE can be integrated into any GNN-based MTS anomaly detection method in a plug-and-play manner. In addition, the memory-augmented routers are proposed in this paper to capture the correlation temporal information in terms of the global historical features of MTS to adaptively weigh the obtained entity representations to achieve successful anomaly estimation. Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets prove the superiority of our approach and each proposed module.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

This problem is called a maximum entropy density control problem. Specifically, the running cost is given by quadratic forms of the state and the control input, and the initial and target distributions are Gaussian. We first reveal that our problem boils down to solving two Riccati difference equations coupled through their boundary values. Based on them, we give the closed-form expression of the unique optimal policy. Next, we show that the optimal density control of a backward system can be obtained simultaneously with the forward-time optimal policy. The backward solution gives another expression of the forward solution. Finally, by considering the limit where the entropy regularization vanishes, we derive the unregularized density control in closed form.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, accepted in IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

However, while image generation models can produce visually diverse images, single-modality data enhancement techniques still fail to capture the comprehensive knowledge provided by different modalities. Additionally, we note that the performance of TPT-based methods drops significantly when the number of augmented images is limited, which is not unusual given the computational expense of generative augmentation. To address these issues, we introduce IT3A, a novel test-time adaptation method that utilizes a pre-trained generative model for multi-modal augmentation of each test sample from unknown new domains. By combining augmented data from pre-trained vision and language models, we enhance the ability of the model to adapt to unknown new test data. Additionally, to ensure that key semantics are accurately retained when generating various visual and text enhancements, we employ cosine similarity filtering between the logits of the enhanced images and text with the original test data. This process allows us to filter out some spurious augmentation and inadequate combinations. To leverage the diverse enhancements provided by the generation model across different modals, we have replaced prompt tuning with an adapter for greater flexibility in utilizing text templates. Our experiments on the test datasets with distribution shifts and domain gaps show that in a zero-shot setting, IT3A outperforms state-of-the-art test-time prompt tuning methods with a 5.50% increase in accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by International Journal of Computer Vision</p></details> |

Currently, deep learning-based AEC methods primarily focus on refining model architectures, frequently neglecting the incorporation of knowledge from traditional filter theory.

Our method strategically harnesses attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of double-talk interference, thereby optimizing the efficiency of knowledge utilization. The derivation of the short-term Wiener solution, which adapts classical Wiener solutions to finite input causality, integrates established insights from filter theory into this method.

These groups sell premium access to inside information, worsening information asymmetry and financial risks for subscribers and all investors. This paper presents a real-time prediction pipeline to forecast target coins and alert investors to possible P&D schemes. In a Poloniex case study, the model accurately identified the target coin among the top five from 50 random coins in 24 out of 43 (55.81%) P&D events. The pipeline uses advanced natural language processing (NLP) to classify Telegram messages, identifying 2,079 past pump events and detecting new ones in real-time. Our analysis also evaluates the susceptibility of token standards - ERC-20, ERC-721, BRC-20, Inscriptions, and Runes - to manipulation and identifies exchanges commonly involved in P&D schemes.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a novel approach that adapts the multi-modal self-supervised AV-HuBERT model for text prediction from rtMRI and incorporates a new flow-based duration predictor for speaker-specific alignment. The predicted text and durations are then used by a speech decoder to synthesize aligned speech in any novel voice. We conduct thorough experiments on two datasets and demonstrate our method's generalization ability to unseen speakers. We assess our framework's performance by masking parts of the rtMRI video to evaluate the impact of different articulators on text prediction. Our method achieves a $15.18\%$ Word Error Rate (WER) on the USC-TIMIT MRI corpus, marking a huge improvement over the current state-of-the-art.

| **[Unlocking the Power of Patch: Patch-Based MLP for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13575v3)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have attempted to refine the Transformer architecture to demonstrate its effectiveness in Long-Term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF) tasks. Despite surpassing many linear forecasting models with ever-improving performance, we remain skeptical of Transformers as a solution for LTSF. We attribute the effectiveness of these models largely to the adopted Patch mechanism, which enhances sequence locality to an extent yet fails to fully address the loss of temporal information inherent to the permutation-invariant self-attention mechanism. Further investigation suggests that simple linear layers augmented with the Patch mechanism may outperform complex Transformer-based LTSF models. Moreover, diverging from models that use channel independence, our research underscores the importance of cross-variable interactions in enhancing the performance of multivariate time series forecasting. The interaction information between variables is highly valuable but has been misapplied in past studies, leading to suboptimal cross-variable models. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and simple Patch-based MLP (PatchMLP) for LTSF tasks. Specifically, we employ simple moving averages to extract smooth components and noise-containing residuals from time series data, engaging in semantic information interchange through channel mixing and specializing in random noise with channel independence processing. The PatchMLP model consistently achieves state-of-the-art results on several real-world datasets. We hope this surprising finding will spur new research directions in the LTSF field and pave the way for more efficient and concise solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ister: Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer for Explainable Multivariate Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18798v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In long-term time series forecasting, Transformer-based models have achieved great success, due to its ability to capture long-range dependencies. However, existing transformer-based methods face challenges in accurately identifying which variables play a pivotal role in the prediction process and tend to overemphasize noisy channels, thereby limiting the interpretability and practical effectiveness of the models. Besides, it faces scalability issues due to quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this paper, we propose a new model named Inverted Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Transformer (Ister), which addresses these challenges in long-term multivariate time series forecasting by designing an improved Transformer-based structure. Ister firstly decomposes original time series into seasonal and trend components. Then we propose a new Dot-attention mechanism to process the seasonal component, which improves both accuracy, computation complexity and interpretability. Upon completion of the training phase, it allows users to intuitively visualize the significance of each feature in the overall prediction. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that Ister achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, surpassing existing models in long-term prediction tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Time Series of Networked Dynamical Systems without Knowing Topology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18734v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world complex systems, such as epidemic spreading networks and ecosystems, can be modeled as networked dynamical systems that produce multivariate time series. Learning the intrinsic dynamics from observational data is pivotal for forecasting system behaviors and making informed decisions. However, existing methods for modeling networked time series often assume known topologies, whereas real-world networks are typically incomplete or inaccurate, with missing or spurious links that hinder precise predictions. Moreover, while networked time series often originate from diverse topologies, the ability of models to generalize across topologies has not been systematically evaluated. To address these gaps, we propose a novel framework for learning network dynamics directly from observed time-series data, when prior knowledge of graph topology or governing dynamical equations is absent. Our approach leverages continuous graph neural networks with an attention mechanism to construct a latent topology, enabling accurate reconstruction of future trajectories for network states. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic networks demonstrate that our model not only captures dynamics effectively without topology knowledge but also generalizes to unseen time series originating from diverse topologies.</p></details> |  |

This advancement facilitates their application in controlling drones and robots for various tasks. However, existing LLM serving systems typically employ a first-come, first-served (FCFS) batching mechanism, which fails to address the time-sensitive requirements of robotic applications. To address it, this paper proposes a new system named TimelyLLM serving multiple robotic agents with time-sensitive requests. TimelyLLM introduces novel mechanisms of segmented generation and scheduling that optimally leverage redundancy between robot plan generation and execution phases. We report an implementation of TimelyLLM on a widely-used LLM serving framework and evaluate it on a range of robotic applications. Our evaluation shows that TimelyLLM improves the time utility up to 1.97x, and reduces the overall waiting time by 84%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Spending Analysis of Nakamoto Consensus for Time-Varying Mining Rates with Ruin Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18599v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theoretical guarantees for double spending probabilities for the Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule have been extensively studied for zero/bounded network delays and fixed mining rates. In this paper, we introduce a ruin-theoretical model of double spending for Nakamoto consensus under the $k$-deep confirmation rule when the honest mining rate is allowed to be an arbitrary function of time including the block delivery periods, i.e., time periods during which mined blocks are being delivered to all other participants of the network. Time-varying mining rates are considered to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the peer to peer network delays as well as dynamic participation of miners such as the gap game and switching between different cryptocurrencies. Ruin theory is leveraged to obtain the double spend probabilities and numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Time Optimization Framework for the Implementation of Robust and Low-latency Quantum Circuits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18533v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing has garnered attention for its potential to solve complex computational problems with considerable speedup. Despite notable advancements in the field, achieving meaningful scalability and noise control in quantum hardware remains challenging. Incoherent errors caused by decoherence restrict the total computation time, making it very short. While hardware advancements continue to progress, quantum software specialists seek to minimize quantum circuit latency to mitigate dissipation. However, at the pulse level, fast quantum gates often lead to leakage, leaving minimal room for further optimization. Recent advancements have shown the effectiveness of quantum control techniques in generating quantum gates robust to coherent error sources. Nevertheless, these techniques come with a trade-off -- extended gate durations. In this paper, we introduce an alternative pulse scheduling approach that enables the use of both fast and robust quantum gates within the same quantum circuit. The time-optimization framework models the quantum circuit as a dependency graph, implements the fastest quantum gates on the critical path, and uses idle periods outside the critical path to optimally implement longer, more robust gates from the gate set, without increasing latency. Experiments conducted on IBMQ Brisbane show that this approach improves the absolute success probability of quantum circuit execution by more than 25%, with performance gains scaling as the number of qubits increases.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[From CNN to CNN + RNN: Adapting Visualization Techniques for Time-Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04707v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are highly effective in solving complex problems but are often viewed as "black boxes," limiting their adoption in contexts where transparency and explainability are essential. This lack of visibility raises ethical and legal concerns, particularly in critical areas like security, where automated decisions can have significant consequences. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) underscores the importance of justifying these decisions. In this work, we explore visualization techniques to improve the understanding of anomaly detection models based on convolutional recurrent neural networks (CNN + RNN) with a TimeDistributed layer. Our model combines VGG19 for convolutional feature extraction and a GRU layer for sequential analysis of real-time video data. While suitable for temporal data, this structure complicates gradient propagation, as sequence elements are processed independently, dissociating temporal information. We adapt visualization techniques such as saliency maps and Grad-CAM to address these challenges. This article highlights the difficulties in visually interpreting video-based models and demonstrates how techniques for static images can be adapted to recurrent architectures, offering a transitional solution in the absence of dedicated methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study is the first to explore the performance of a time-series foundation model for Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18975v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has significantly advanced time series forecasting through its powerful capacity to capture sequence relationships. However, training these models with the Mean Square Error (MSE) loss often results in over-smooth predictions, making it challenging to handle the complexity and learn high-entropy features from time series data with high variability and unpredictability. In this work, we introduce a novel approach by tokenizing time series values to train forecasting models via cross-entropy loss, while considering the continuous nature of time series data. Specifically, we propose a Hierarchical Classification Auxiliary Network, HCAN, a general model-agnostic component that can be integrated with any forecasting model. HCAN is based on a Hierarchy-Aware Attention module that integrates multi-granularity high-entropy features at different hierarchy levels. At each level, we assign a class label for timesteps to train an Uncertainty-Aware Classifier. This classifier mitigates the over-confidence in softmax loss via evidence theory. We also implement a Hierarchical Consistency Loss to maintain prediction consistency across hierarchy levels. Extensive experiments integrating HCAN with state-of-the-art forecasting models demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines on several real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Performance Bound of Finite Blocklength Coded MIMO: Time-Domain versus Spatiotemporal Channel Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13922v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the sixth generation (6G), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) will further develop to achieve TKu extreme connectivity, and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) is expected to be a key enabler for its realization. On the premise of ensuring the same rate and reliability, the spatial domain advantage of MIMO has the potential to further shorten the time-domain code length. Different coded MIMO schemes exhibit disparities in exploiting the spatial domain characteristics, so it is necessary to theoretically elucidate the performance of different coding schemes to illustrate how MIMO can support 6G TKu transmission. We consider two extreme MIMO coding schemes, namely, time-domain coded MIMO where the codewords on multiple spatial channels are independent of each other, and spatiotemporal coded MIMO in which multiple spatial channels are jointly coded. In this paper, by analyzing the statistical characteristics of information density and utilizing the normal approximation, we provide explicit performance bounds for finite blocklength coded MIMO under time-domain coding and spatiotemporal coding. We find that spatiotemporal coding can effectively alleviate the performance degradation induced by short blocklength by improving the spatial degrees of freedom (DoF). However, for time-domain coding, the independent coding of each spatial link results in more severe performance degradation due to shorter blocklength, even when a relatively large spatial DoF is available. These results indicate that spatiotemporal coding can optimally exploit the spatial dimension advantages of MIMO systems compared with time-domain coding, enabling extremely low error-rate communication under stringent blocklength constraint.</p></details> | 33 pages, 8 figures |

A recent attempt relaxed the assumption by introducing limited human annotation, referred to as Human-In-the-Loop Test-Time Adaptation (HILTTA) in this study. The focus of existing HILTTA studies lies in selecting the most informative samples to label, a.k.a. active learning. In this work, we are motivated by a pitfall of TTA, i.e. sensitivity to hyper-parameters, and propose to approach HILTTA by synergizing active learning and model selection. Specifically, we first select samples for human annotation (active learning) and then use the labeled data to select optimal hyper-parameters (model selection). To prevent the model selection process from overfitting to local distributions, multiple regularization techniques are employed to complement the validation objective. A sample selection strategy is further tailored by considering the balance between active learning and model selection purposes. We demonstrate on 5 TTA datasets that the proposed HILTTA approach is compatible with off-the-shelf TTA methods and such combinations substantially outperform the state-of-the-art HILTTA methods. Importantly, our proposed method can always prevent choosing the worst hyper-parameters on all off-the-shelf TTA methods.

Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin. Our codes will be available at https://github.com/yuezijie/STINet-Space-time-Video-Super-resolution.</p></details> | Neural Networks |

One significant task to show LLMs' reasoning capability is code time complexity prediction, which involves various intricate factors such as the input range of variables and conditional loops. Current benchmarks fall short of providing a rigorous assessment due to limited data, language constraints, and insufficient labeling. They do not consider time complexity based on input representation and merely evaluate whether predictions fall into the same class, lacking a measure of how close incorrect predictions are to the correct ones. To address these dependencies, we introduce CodeComplex, the first robust and extensive dataset designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities in predicting code time complexity. CodeComplex comprises 4,900 Java codes and an equivalent number of Python codes, overcoming language and labeling constraints, carefully annotated with complexity labels based on input characteristics by a panel of algorithmic experts. Additionally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for the reasoning of complexity prediction tasks, offering a more precise and reliable assessment of LLMs' reasoning capabilities. We release our dataset (https://github.com/sybaik1/CodeComplex-Data) and baseline models (https://github.com/sybaik1/CodeComplex-Models) publicly to encourage the relevant (NLP, SE, and PL) communities to utilize and participate in this research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Deep Canonical Time Warping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18234v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal alignment of sequences is a fundamental challenge in many applications, such as computer vision and bioinformatics, where local time shifting needs to be accounted for. Misalignment can lead to poor model generalization, especially in high-dimensional sequences. Existing methods often struggle with optimization when dealing with high-dimensional sparse data, falling into poor alignments. Feature selection is frequently used to enhance model performance for sparse data. However, a fixed set of selected features would not generally work for dynamically changing sequences and would need to be modified based on the state of the sequence. Therefore, modifying the selected feature based on contextual input would result in better alignment. Our suggested method, Conditional Deep Canonical Temporal Time Warping (CDCTW), is designed for temporal alignment in sparse temporal data to address these challenges. CDCTW enhances alignment accuracy for high dimensional time-dependent views be performing dynamic time warping on data embedded in maximally correlated subspace which handles sparsity with novel feature selection method. We validate the effectiveness of CDCTW through extensive experiments on various datasets, demonstrating superior performance over previous techniques.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an open-source computational framework called GRATEV2.0 (GRaph-based Analysis of TEM), designed for real-time analysis of HRTEM data, with a focus on characterizing complex microstructures in conjugated polymers, illustrated using Poly[N-9'-heptadecanyl-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(4',7'-di-2-thienyl-2',1',3'-benzothiadiazole)] (PCDTBT), a key material in organic photovoltaics. GRATEV2.0 employs fast, automated image processing algorithms, enabling rapid extraction of structural features like d-spacing, orientation, and crystal shape metrics. Gaussian process optimization rapidly identifies the user-defined parameters in the approach, reducing the need for manual parameter tuning and thus enhancing reproducibility and usability. Additionally, GRATEV2.0 is compatible with high-performance computing (HPC) environments, allowing for efficient, large-scale data processing at near real-time speeds. A unique feature of GRATEV2.0 is a Wasserstein distance-based stopping criterion, which optimizes data collection by determining when further sampling no longer adds statistically significant information. This capability optimizes the amount of time the TEM facility is used while ensuring data adequacy for in-depth analysis. Open-source and tested on a substantial PCDTBT dataset, this tool offers a powerful, robust, and accessible solution for high-throughput material characterization in organic electronics.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations.</p></details> |  |

Our approach acts as a neural controller designed to achieve desired target coverage, leveraging auxiliary multi-view data with neural network encoders in an end-to-end manner to further enhance adaptivity. Additionally, our model is designed to enhance the consistency of prediction intervals in different quantiles by integrating monotonicity constraints and leverages data from related tasks to boost few-shot learning performance. Using real-world datasets from epidemics, electric demand, weather, and others, we empirically demonstrate significant improvements in coverage and probabilistic accuracy, and find that our method is the only one that combines good calibration with consistency in prediction intervals.</p></details> |  |

Unlike classical Stochastic Volatility or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric stationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV) model provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility and its uncertainty (vol of vol). We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed global-local shrinkage prior. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience with low prediction error across various data generating scenarios in simulation. Furthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates facilitates a clearer understanding of underlying patterns and trends in volatility. Additionally, we propose and illustrate an extension for Bayesian Trend Filtering simultaneously in both mean and variance. Finally, we show that this attribute makes ASV a robust tool applicable across a wide range of disciplines, including in finance, environmental science, epidemiology, and medicine, among others.</p></details> |  |

Hyperspectral line-scan cameras are a low-cost solution that enhance confidence in anomaly detection over RGB and multispectral imagery. However, existing line-scan algorithms are too slow when using small computers (e.g. those onboard a drone or small satellite), do not adapt to changing scenery, or lack robustness against geometric distortions. This paper introduces the Exponentially moving RX algorithm (ERX) to address these issues, and compares it with four existing RX-based anomaly detection methods for hyperspectral line scanning. Three large and more complex datasets are also introduced to better assess the practical challenges when using line-scan cameras (two hyperspectral and one multispectral). ERX was evaluated using a Jetson Xavier NX edge computing module (6-core CPU, 8GB RAM, 20W power draw), achieving the best combination of speed and detection performance. ERX was 9 times faster than the next-best algorithm on the dataset with the highest number of bands (108 band), with an average speed of 561 lines per second on the Jetson. It achieved a 29.3% AUC improvement over the next-best algorithm on the most challenging dataset, while showing greater adaptability through consistently high AUC scores regardless of the camera's starting location. ERX performed robustly across all datasets, achieving an AUC of 0.941 on a drone-collected hyperspectral line scan dataset without geometric corrections (a 16.9% improvement over existing algorithms). This work enables future research on the detection of anomalous objects in real time, adaptive and automatic threshold selection, and real-time field tests.

However, the development of a knowledge extraction framework is fundamental. Currently, there is a lack of a unified and practical framework for modeling heterogeneous sensor data within buildings. In this paper, we propose a practical inference framework for extracting status-to-event knowledge within smart building. Our proposal includes IoT-based API integration, ontology model design, and time probability dependent knowledge extraction methods. The Building Topology Ontology (BOT) was leveraged to construct spatial relations among sensors and spaces within the building. We utilized Apache Jena Fuseki's SPARQL server for storing and querying the RDF triple data. Two types of knowledge could be extracted: timestamp-based probability for abnormal event detection and time interval-based probability for conjunction of multiple events. We conducted experiments (over a 78-day period) in a real smart building environment. The data of light and elevator states has been collected for evaluation. The evaluation revealed several inferred events, such as room occupancy, elevator trajectory tracking, and the conjunction of both events. The numerical values of detected event counts and probability demonstrate the potential for automatic control in the smart building.</p></details> |  |

The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.</p></details> |  |

Recent works proposed a microarchitecture framework and custom macro suite for designing highly energy-efficient application-specific TNNs. These recent works rely on manual hardware design, a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. Further, there is no open-source functional simulation framework for TNNs. This paper introduces TNNGen, a pioneering effort towards the automated design of TNNs from PyTorch software models to post-layout netlists. TNNGen comprises a novel PyTorch functional simulator (for TNN modeling and application exploration) coupled with a Python-based hardware generator (for PyTorch-to-RTL and RTL-to-Layout conversions). Seven representative TNN designs for time-series signal clustering across diverse sensory modalities are simulated and their post-layout hardware complexity and design runtimes are assessed to demonstrate the effectiveness of TNNGen. We also highlight TNNGen's ability to accurately forecast silicon metrics without running hardware process flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II: Express Briefs, May 2024</p></details> |
| **[VITRO: Vocabulary Inversion for Time-series Representation Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17921v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although LLMs have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating textual data, their pre-trained vocabularies are ill-suited for capturing the nuanced temporal dynamics and patterns inherent in time series. The discrete, symbolic nature of natural language tokens, which these vocabularies are designed to represent, does not align well with the continuous, numerical nature of time series data. To address this fundamental limitation, we propose VITRO. Our method adapts textual inversion optimization from the vision-language domain in order to learn a new time series per-dataset vocabulary that bridges the gap between the discrete, semantic nature of natural language and the continuous, numerical nature of time series data. We show that learnable time series-specific pseudo-word embeddings represent time series data better than existing general language model vocabularies, with VITRO-enhanced methods achieving state-of-the-art performance in long-term forecasting across most datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[On Quantile Randomized Kaczmarz for Linear Systems with Time-Varying Noise and Corruption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19874v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale systems of linear equations arise in machine learning, medical imaging, sensor networks, and in many areas of data science. When the scale of the systems are extreme, it is common for a fraction of the data or measurements to be corrupted. The Quantile Randomized Kaczmarz (QRK) method is known to converge on large-scale systems of linear equations $A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}$ that are inconsistent due to static corruptions in the measurement vector $\mathbf{b}$. We prove that QRK converges even for systems corrupted by time-varying perturbations. Additionally, we prove that QRK converges up to a convergence horizon on systems affected by time-varying noise and corruption. Finally, we utilize Markov's inequality to prove a lower bound on the probability that the largest entries of the QRK residual reveal the time-varying corruption in each iteration. We present numerical experiments which illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Graph Coloring Game on $4\times n$-Grids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17668v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The graph coloring game is a famous two-player game (re)introduced by Bodlaender in $1991$. Given a graph $G$ and $k \in \mathbb{N}$, Alice and Bob alternately (starting with Alice) color an uncolored vertex with some color in $\{1,\cdots,k\}$ such that no two adjacent vertices receive a same color. If eventually all vertices are colored, then Alice wins and Bob wins otherwise. The game chromatic number $\chi_g(G)$ is the smallest integer $k$ such that Alice has a winning strategy with $k$ colors in $G$. It has been recently (2020) shown that, given a graph $G$ and $k\in \mathbb{N}$, deciding whether $\chi_g(G)\leq k$ is PSPACE-complete. Surprisingly, this parameter is not well understood even in ``simple" graph classes. Let $P_n$ denote the path with $n\geq 1$ vertices. For instance, in the case of Cartesian grids, it is easy to show that $\chi_g(P_m \times P_n) \leq 5$ since $\chi_g(G)\leq \Delta+1$ for any graph $G$ with maximum degree $\Delta$. However, the exact value is only known for small values of $m$, namely $\chi_g(P_1\times P_n)=3$, $\chi_g(P_2\times P_n)=4$ and $\chi_g(P_3\times P_n) =4$ for $n\geq 4$ [Raspaud, Wu, 2009]. Here, we prove that, for every $n\geq 18$, $\chi_g(P_4\times P_n) =4$.</p></details> | 22 pages, 22 figures |

EasyTime, the system we demonstrate, facilitates easy use of time-series forecasting methods by researchers and practitioners alike. First, EasyTime enables one-click evaluation, enabling researchers to evaluate new forecasting methods using the suite of diverse time series datasets collected in the preexisting time series forecasting benchmark (TFB). This is achieved by leveraging TFB's flexible and consistent evaluation pipeline. Second, when practitioners must perform forecasting on a new dataset, a nontrivial first step is often to find an appropriate forecasting method. EasyTime provides an Automated Ensemble module that combines the promising forecasting methods to yield superior forecasting accuracy compared to individual methods. Third, EasyTime offers a natural language Q&A module leveraging large language models. Given a question like "Which method is best for long term forecasting on time series with strong seasonality?", EasyTime converts the question into SQL queries on the database of results obtained by TFB and then returns an answer in natural language and charts. By demonstrating EasyTime, we intend to show how it is possible to simplify the use of time series forecasting and to offer better support for the development of new generations of time series forecasting methods.</p></details> | Accepted by ICDE2025 |
| **[Quantum Time-Series Learning with Evolutionary Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17580v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variational quantum circuits have arisen as an important method in quantum computing. A crucial step of it is parameter optimization, which is typically tackled through gradient-descent techniques. We advantageously explore instead the use of evolutionary algorithms for such optimization, specifically for time-series forecasting. We perform a comparison, for diverse instances of real-world data, between gradient-descent parameter optimization and covariant-matrix adaptation evolutionary strategy. We observe that gradient descent becomes permanently trapped in local minima that have been avoided by evolutionary algorithms in all tested datasets, reaching up to a six-fold decrease in prediction error. Finally, the combined use of evolutionary and gradient-based techniques is explored, aiming at retaining advantages of both. The results are particularly applicable in scenarios sensitive to gains in accuracy.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Are Self-Attentions Effective for Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16877v3)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is crucial for applications across multiple domains and various scenarios. Although Transformer models have dramatically advanced the landscape of forecasting, their effectiveness remains debated. Recent findings have indicated that simpler linear models might outperform complex Transformer-based approaches, highlighting the potential for more streamlined architectures. In this paper, we shift the focus from evaluating the overall Transformer architecture to specifically examining the effectiveness of self-attention for time series forecasting. To this end, we introduce a new architecture, Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS), that rethinks the traditional Transformer framework by eliminating self-attention and leveraging cross-attention mechanisms instead. By establishing future horizon-dependent parameters as queries and enhanced parameter sharing, our model not only improves long-term forecasting accuracy but also reduces the number of parameters and memory usage. Extensive experiment across various datasets demonstrates that our model achieves superior performance with the lowest mean squared error and uses fewer parameters compared to existing models. The implementation of our model is available at: https://github.com/dongbeank/CATS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Recent advances in Constraint Programming (CP) and Temporal Networks have reinvoked interest in evaluating the advantages and drawbacks of various proactive and reactive scheduling methods. First, we present a new, CP-based fully proactive method. Second, we show how a reactive approach can be constructed using an online rescheduling procedure. A third contribution is based on partial order schedules and uses Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (STNUs). Our statistical analysis shows that the STNU-based algorithm performs best in terms of solution quality, while also showing good relative offline and online computation time.</p></details> |  |

We employ a solution representation by the Danford-Cauchy integral on hyperbola that envelopes spectrum of the operator coefficient with a subsequent application of an exponentially convergent quadrature. To do that, parameters of the hyperbola are chosen so that the integration function has an analytical extension into a strip around the real axis and then apply the Sinc-quadrature. We show the exponential accuracy and illustrate the results by a numerical example confirming the {\it a priori} estimate. Existence conditions for the solution of the inhomogeneous equation are established.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to build your latent Markov model -- the role of time and space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19157v3)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical models that involve latent Markovian state processes have become immensely popular tools for analysing time series and other sequential data. However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) numerical maximum likelihood estimation of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 52 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Neural Continuous-Time Supermartingale Certificates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17432v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce for the first time a neural-certificate framework for continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems. Autonomous learning systems in the physical world demand continuous-time reasoning, yet existing learnable certificates for probabilistic verification assume discretization of the time continuum. Inspired by the success of training neural Lyapunov certificates for deterministic continuous-time systems and neural supermartingale certificates for stochastic discrete-time systems, we propose a framework that bridges the gap between continuous-time and probabilistic neural certification for dynamical systems under complex requirements. Our method combines machine learning and symbolic reasoning to produce formally certified bounds on the probabilities that a nonlinear system satisfies specifications of reachability, avoidance, and persistence. We present both the theoretical justification and the algorithmic implementation of our framework and showcase its efficacy on popular benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of justified graph kernels for spatio-temporal modelling has held back their use in graph problems. We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge. Thus, we explore leveraging spatio-temporal cues to address object grounding and propose a 4D question-answering framework (4D-QA) to discover interacted objects from diverse videos. Our method demonstrates significant superiority in extensive experiments compared to current baselines.

We build on an encoder-decoder architecture with parallel decoding and make two key contributions. First, we introduce a bi-directional action context regularizer module on the top of the decoder that ensures temporal context coherence in temporally adjacent segments. Second, we learn from classified segments a transition matrix that models the probability of transitioning from one action to another and the sequence is optimized globally over the full prediction interval. In addition, we use a specialized encoder for the task of action segmentation to increase the quality of the predictions in the observation interval at inference time, leading to a better understanding of the past. We validate our methods on four benchmark datasets for LTA, the EpicKitchen-55, EGTEA+, 50Salads and Breakfast demonstrating superior or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, including probabilistic models and also those based on Large Language Models, that assume trimmed video as input. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting PCA for time series reduction in temporal dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19423v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Revisiting PCA for Time Series Reduction in Temporal Dimension; Jiaxin Gao, Wenbo Hu, Yuntian Chen; Deep learning has significantly advanced time series analysis (TSA), enabling the extraction of complex patterns for tasks like classification, forecasting, and regression. Although dimensionality reduction has traditionally focused on the variable space-achieving notable success in minimizing data redundancy and computational complexity-less attention has been paid to reducing the temporal dimension. In this study, we revisit Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a classical dimensionality reduction technique, to explore its utility in temporal dimension reduction for time series data. It is generally thought that applying PCA to the temporal dimension would disrupt temporal dependencies, leading to limited exploration in this area. However, our theoretical analysis and extensive experiments demonstrate that applying PCA to sliding series windows not only maintains model performance, but also enhances computational efficiency. In auto-regressive forecasting, the temporal structure is partially preserved through windowing, and PCA is applied within these windows to denoise the time series while retaining their statistical information. By preprocessing time-series data with PCA, we reduce the temporal dimensionality before feeding it into TSA models such as Linear, Transformer, CNN, and RNN architectures. This approach accelerates training and inference and reduces resource consumption. Notably, PCA improves Informer training and inference speed by up to 40% and decreases GPU memory usage of TimesNet by 30%, without sacrificing model accuracy. Comparative analysis against other reduction methods further highlights the effectiveness of PCA in improving the efficiency of TSA models.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Action-background ambiguity, primarily caused by background noise resulting from aggregation and intra-action variation, is a significant challenge for existing WS-TAL methods. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid multi-head attention (HMHA) module and generalized uncertainty-based evidential fusion (GUEF) module to address the problem. The proposed HMHA effectively enhances RGB and optical flow features by filtering redundant information and adjusting their feature distribution to better align with the WS-TAL task. Additionally, the proposed GUEF adaptively eliminates the interference of background noise by fusing snippet-level evidences to refine uncertainty measurement and select superior foreground feature information, which enables the model to concentrate on integral action instances to achieve better action localization and classification performance. Experimental results conducted on the THUMOS14 dataset demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

The task is divided into two tracks: "in bed" and "not in bed" segmented detection, and streaming detection, facing challenges such as individual differences, posture variations, and external disturbances. We propose a spectral-temporal fusion-based feature representation method with mixup data augmentation, and adopt Intersection over Union (IoU) loss to optimize detection accuracy. In the two tracks, our method achieved outstanding results of 100.00% and 95.55% in detection scores, securing first place and third place, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Many summarize agent behavior in terms of the constraints, or ''rules,'' which the agent adheres to during its trajectories. In this work, we narrow the focus from summary to specific moments in individual trajectories, offering a ''pointwise-in-time'' view. Our novel framework, which we define on Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) rules, assigns an intuitive status to any rule in order to describe the trajectory progress at individual time steps; here, a rule is classified as active, satisfied, inactive, or violated. Given a trajectory, a user may query for status of specific LTL rules at individual trajectory time steps. In this paper, we present this novel framework, named Rule Status Assessment (RSA), and provide an example of its implementation. We find that pointwise-in-time status assessment is useful as a post-hoc diagnostic, enabling a user to systematically track the agent's behavior with respect to a set of rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>See r...</summary><p>See related publication in Conference on Decision and Control (CDC) 2023</p></details> |

Recent advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed video QA by leveraging their exceptional commonsense reasoning capabilities. This progress is largely driven by the effective alignment between visual data and the language space of MLLMs. However, for video QA, an additional space-time alignment poses a considerable challenge for extracting question-relevant information across frames. In this work, we investigate diverse temporal modeling techniques to integrate with MLLMs, aiming to achieve question-guided temporal modeling that leverages pre-trained visual and textual alignment in MLLMs. We propose T-Former, a novel temporal modeling method that creates a question-guided temporal bridge between frame-wise visual perception and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Our evaluation across multiple video QA benchmarks demonstrates that T-Former competes favorably with existing temporal modeling approaches and aligns with recent advancements in video QA.</p></details> | WACV 2025 |

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

Temporal understanding makes video-text retrieval more challenging than image-text retrieval. However, we find that the widely used video-text benchmarks have shortcomings in comprehensively assessing abilities of models, especially in temporal understanding, causing large-scale image-text pre-trained models can already achieve comparable zero-shot performance with video-text pre-trained models. In this paper, we introduce RTime, a novel temporal-emphasized video-text retrieval dataset. We first obtain videos of actions or events with significant temporality, and then reverse these videos to create harder negative samples. We then recruit annotators to judge the significance and reversibility of candidate videos, and write captions for qualified videos. We further adopt GPT-4 to extend more captions based on human-written captions. Our RTime dataset currently consists of 21k videos with 10 captions per video, totalling about 122 hours. Based on RTime, we propose three retrieval benchmark tasks: RTime-Origin, RTime-Hard, and RTime-Binary. We further enhance the use of harder-negatives in model training, and benchmark a variety of video-text models on RTime. Extensive experiment analysis proves that RTime indeed poses new and higher challenges to video-text retrieval. We release our RTime dataset\footnote{\url{https://github.com/qyr0403/Reversed-in-Time}} to further advance video-text retrieval and multimodal understanding research.</p></details> | ACMMM 2024 poster |
| **[Investigating the Temporal Dynamics of Cyber Threat Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19086v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) play a crucial role in the rapid detection and mitigation of cyber threats. However, the existing body of literature lacks in-depth analytical studies on the temporal aspects of IoC publication, especially when considering up-to-date datasets related to Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs). This paper addresses this gap by conducting an analysis of the timeliness and comprehensiveness of Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) pertaining to several recent CVEs. The insights derived from this study aim to enhance cybersecurity defense strategies, particularly when dealing with dynamic cyber threats that continually adapt their Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Utilizing IoCs sourced from multiple providers, we scrutinize the IoC publication rate. Our analysis delves into how various factors, including the inherent nature of a threat, its evolutionary trajectory, and its observability over time, influence the publication rate of IoCs. Our preliminary findings emphasize the critical need for cyber defenders to maintain a constant state of vigilance in updating their IoCs for any given vulnerability. This vigilance is warranted because the publication rate of IoCs may exhibit fluctuations over time. We observe a recurring pattern akin to an epidemic model, with an initial phase following the public disclosure of a vulnerability characterized by sparse IoC publications, followed by a sudden surge, and subsequently, a protracted period with a slower rate of IoC publication.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

Recent works on unary-based matrix multiplication hardware aim to leverage data sparsity and low-precision values to enhance hardware efficiency. However, the adoption and integration of such unary hardware into commercial deep learning accelerators (DLA) remain limited due to processing element (PE) array dataflow differences. This work presents Tempus Core, a convolution core with highly scalable unary-based PE array comprising of tub (temporal-unary-binary) multipliers that seamlessly integrates with the NVDLA (NVIDIA's open-source DLA for accelerating CNNs) while maintaining dataflow compliance and boosting hardware efficiency. Analysis across various datapath granularities shows that for INT8 precision in 45nm CMOS, Tempus Core's PE cell unit (PCU) yields 59.3% and 15.3% reductions in area and power consumption, respectively, over NVDLA's CMAC unit. Considering a 16x16 PE array in Tempus Core, area and power improves by 75% and 62%, respectively, while delivering 5x and 4x iso-area throughput improvements for INT8 and INT4 precisions. Post-place and route analysis of Tempus Core's PCU shows that the 16x4 PE array for INT4 precision in 45nm CMOS requires only 0.017 mm^2 die area and consumes only 6.2mW of total power. We demonstrate that area-power efficient unary-based hardware can be seamlessly integrated into conventional DLAs, paving the path for efficient unary hardware for edge AI inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in DATE 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce visual trace prompting, a simple yet effective approach to facilitate VLA models' spatial-temporal awareness for action prediction by encoding state-action trajectories visually. We develop a new TraceVLA model by finetuning OpenVLA on our own collected dataset of 150K robot manipulation trajectories using visual trace prompting. Evaluations of TraceVLA across 137 configurations in SimplerEnv and 4 tasks on a physical WidowX robot demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, outperforming OpenVLA by 10% on SimplerEnv and 3.5x on real-robot tasks and exhibiting robust generalization across diverse embodiments and scenarios. To further validate the effectiveness and generality of our method, we present a compact VLA model based on 4B Phi-3-Vision, pretrained on the Open-X-Embodiment and finetuned on our dataset, rivals the 7B OpenVLA baseline while significantly improving inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[TINQ: Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18933v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) has been actively researched for user-generated content (UGC) videos. Recently, super-resolution (SR) techniques have been widely applied in UGC. Therefore, an effective BVQA method for both UGC and SR scenarios is essential. Temporal inconsistency, referring to irregularities between consecutive frames, is relevant to video quality. Current BVQA approaches typically model temporal relationships in UGC videos using statistics of motion information, but inconsistencies remain unexplored. Additionally, different from temporal inconsistency in UGC videos, such inconsistency in SR videos is amplified due to upscaling algorithms. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Inconsistency Guided Blind Video Quality Assessment (TINQ) metric, demonstrating that exploring temporal inconsistency is crucial for effective BVQA. Since temporal inconsistencies vary between UGC and SR videos, they are calculated in different ways. Based on this, a spatial module highlights inconsistent areas across consecutive frames at coarse and fine granularities. In addition, a temporal module aggregates features over time in two stages. The first stage employs a visual memory capacity block to adaptively segment the time dimension based on estimated complexity, while the second stage focuses on selecting key features. The stages work together through Consistency-aware Fusion Units to regress cross-time-scale video quality. Extensive experiments on UGC and SR video quality datasets show that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art BVQA methods.

Existing methods primarily leverage fixed spatial graphs to impute missing values, which implicitly assume that the spatial relationship is roughly the same for all features across different locations. However, they may overlook the different spatial relationships of diverse features recorded by sensors in different locations. To address this, we introduce the multi-scale Graph Structure Learning framework for spatial-temporal Imputation (GSLI) that dynamically adapts to the heterogeneous spatial correlations. Our framework encompasses node-scale graph structure learning to cater to the distinct global spatial correlations of different features, and feature-scale graph structure learning to unveil common spatial correlation across features within all stations. Integrated with prominence modeling, our framework emphasizes nodes and features with greater significance in the imputation process. Furthermore, GSLI incorporates cross-feature and cross-temporal representation learning to capture spatial-temporal dependencies. Evaluated on six real incomplete spatial-temporal datasets, GSLI showcases the improvement in data imputation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a full paper at AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing Spatial-Temporal Data Heterogeneity in Federated Continual Learning via Tail Anchor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18355v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated continual learning (FCL) allows each client to continually update its knowledge from task streams, enhancing the applicability of federated learning in real-world scenarios. However, FCL needs to address not only spatial data heterogeneity between clients but also temporal data heterogeneity between tasks. In this paper, empirical experiments demonstrate that such input-level heterogeneity significantly affects the model's internal parameters and outputs, leading to severe spatial-temporal catastrophic forgetting of local and previous knowledge. To this end, we propose Federated Tail Anchor (FedTA) to mix trainable Tail Anchor with the frozen output features to adjust their position in the feature space, thereby overcoming parameter-forgetting and output-forgetting. Moreover, three novel components are also included in FedTA: Input Enhancement for improving the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks; Selective Input Knowledge Fusion for fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server side; and Best Global Prototype Selection for finding the best anchor point for each class in the feature space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedTA not only outperforms existing FCL methods but also effectively preserves the relative positions of features, remaining unaffected by spatial and temporal changes.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification. Our model sets a new standard of performance on the MMUAD benchmarks, demonstrating superior accuracy and effectiveness.

| **[Enhancing Space-time Video Super-resolution via Spatial-temporal Feature Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08960v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The target of space-time video super-resolution (STVSR) is to increase both the frame rate (also referred to as the temporal resolution) and the spatial resolution of a given video. Recent approaches solve STVSR using end-to-end deep neural networks. A popular solution is to first increase the frame rate of the video; then perform feature refinement among different frame features; and last increase the spatial resolutions of these features. The temporal correlation among features of different frames is carefully exploited in this process. The spatial correlation among features of different (spatial) resolutions, despite being also very important, is however not emphasized. In this paper, we propose a spatial-temporal feature interaction network to enhance STVSR by exploiting both spatial and temporal correlations among features of different frames and spatial resolutions. Specifically, the spatial-temporal frame interpolation module is introduced to interpolate low- and high-resolution intermediate frame features simultaneously and interactively. The spatial-temporal local and global refinement modules are respectively deployed afterwards to exploit the spatial-temporal correlation among different features for their refinement. Finally, a novel motion consistency loss is employed to enhance the motion continuity among reconstructed frames. We conduct experiments on three standard benchmarks, Vid4, Vimeo-90K and Adobe240, and the results demonstrate that our method improves the state of the art methods by a considerable margin.

Thanks to the strong expressivity of deep neural networks, they are emerging as a promising choice for capturing the patterns in asynchronous sequences, in the context of temporal point process. In this paper, we first review recent research emphasis and difficulties in modeling asynchronous event sequences with deep temporal point process, which can be concluded into four fields: encoding of history sequence, formulation of conditional intensity function, relational discovery of events and learning approaches for optimization. We introduce most of recently proposed models by dismantling them into the four parts, and conduct experiments by remodularizing the first three parts with the same learning strategy for a fair empirical evaluation. Besides, we extend the history encoders and conditional intensity function family, and propose a Granger causality discovery framework for exploiting the relations among multi-types of events. Because the Granger causality can be represented by the Granger causality graph, discrete graph structure learning in the framework of Variational Inference is employed to reveal latent structures of the graph. Further experiments show that the proposed framework with latent graph discovery can both capture the relations and achieve an improved fitting and predicting performance.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

However, challenges arise from the high dimensionality, intricate complexity, and interconnected nature of complex patterns, which hinder the understanding of their underlying physical processes. Existing AI methods often face limitations in interpretability, computational efficiency, and scalability, reducing their applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel visual analytics framework that integrates two generative AI models, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), to reduce complex patterns into lower-dimensional latent spaces and visualize them in 2D using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP with DBSCAN. These visualizations, presented through coordinated and interactive views and tailored glyphs, enable intuitive exploration of complex multivariate temporal patterns, identifying patterns' similarities and uncover their potential correlations for a better interpretability of the AI outputs. The framework is demonstrated through a case study on power grid signal data, where it identifies multi-label grid event signatures, including faults and anomalies with diverse root causes. Additionally, novel metrics and visualizations are introduced to validate the models and evaluate the performance, efficiency, and consistency of latent maps generated by TFT and VAE under different configurations. These analyses provide actionable insights for model parameter tuning and reliability improvements. Comparative results highlight that TFT achieves shorter run times and superior scalability to diverse time-series data shapes compared to VAE. This work advances fault diagnosis in multivariate time series, fostering explainable AI to support critical system operations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subtopic-aware View Sampling and Temporal Aggregation for Long-form Document Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07573v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-form document matching aims to judge the relevance between two documents and has been applied to various scenarios. Most existing works utilize hierarchical or long context models to process documents, which achieve coarse understanding but may ignore details. Some researchers construct a document view with similar sentences about aligned document subtopics to focus on detailed matching signals. However, a long document generally contains multiple subtopics. The matching signals are heterogeneous from multiple topics. Considering only the homologous aligned subtopics may not be representative enough and may cause biased modeling. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to model representative matching signals. First, we propose to capture various matching signals through subtopics of document pairs. Next, We construct multiple document views based on subtopics to cover heterogeneous and valuable details. However, existing spatial aggregation methods like attention, which integrate all these views simultaneously, are hard to integrate heterogeneous information. Instead, we propose temporal aggregation, which effectively integrates different views gradually as the training progresses. Experimental results show that our learning framework is effective on several document-matching tasks, including news duplication and legal case retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing fine-grained and comprehensive relations among stations effectively is imperative for metro OD prediction. However, existing metro OD models either mix information from multiple OD pairs from the station's perspective or exclusively focus on a subset of OD pairs. These approaches may overlook fine-grained relations among OD pairs, leading to difficulties in predicting potential anomalous conditions. To address these challenges, we learn traffic evolution from the perspective of all OD pairs and propose a fine-grained spatial-temporal MLP architecture for metro OD prediction, namely ODMixer. Specifically, our ODMixer has double-branch structure and involves the Channel Mixer, the Multi-view Mixer, and the Bidirectional Trend Learner. The Channel Mixer aims to capture short-term temporal relations among OD pairs, the Multi-view Mixer concentrates on capturing spatial relations from both origin and destination perspectives. To model long-term temporal relations, we introduce the Bidirectional Trend Learner. Extensive experiments on two large-scale metro OD prediction datasets HZMOD and SHMO demonstrate the advantages of our ODMixer.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-Modal Meta-Learning for Fine-grained Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13541v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained emotion recognition (FER) plays a vital role in various fields, such as disease diagnosis, personalized recommendations, and multimedia mining. However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |

Recent shift towards edge computing has inspired GEMM architectures based on unary computing, which are predominantly stochastic and rate-coded systems. This paper proposes a novel GEMM architecture based on temporal-coding, called tuGEMM, that performs exact computation. We introduce two variants of tuGEMM, serial and parallel, with distinct area/power-latency trade-offs. Post-synthesis Power-Performance-Area (PPA) in 45 nm CMOS are reported for 2-bit, 4-bit, and 8-bit computations. The designs illustrate significant advantages in area-power efficiency over state-of-the-art stochastic unary systems especially at low precisions, e.g. incurring just 0.03 mm^2 and 9 mW for 4 bits, and 0.01 mm^2 and 4 mW for 2 bits. This makes tuGEMM ideal for power constrained mobile and edge devices performing always-on real-time sensory processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2023 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS), Monterey, CA, USA, 2023</p></details> |

To support energy-efficient edge-native processing, new GEMM hardware units have been proposed that operate on unary encoded bitstreams using much simpler hardware. Most unary approaches thus far focus on rate-based unary encoding of values and perform stochastic approximate computation. This work presents tubGEMM, a novel matrix-multiply unit design that employs hybrid temporal-unary and binary (tub) encoding and performs exact (not approximate) GEMM. It intrinsically exploits dynamic value sparsity to improve energy efficiency. Compared to the current best unary design uGEMM, tubGEMM significantly reduces area, power, and energy by 89\%, 87\%, and 50\%, respectively. A tubGEMM design performing 128x128 matrix multiply on 8-bit integers, in commercial TSMC N5 (5nm) process node, consumes just 0.22 mm^2 die area, 417.72 mW power, and 8.86 uJ energy, assuming no sparsity. Typical sparsity in DL workloads (MobileNetv2, ResNet-50) reduces energy by more than 3x, and lowering precision to 4 and 2 bits further reduces it by 24x and 104x respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2023 IEEE Computer Society Annual Symposium on VLSI (ISVLSI)</p></details> |

Bad actors looking to create successful backdoors must design them to avoid activation during training and evaluation. Since data used in these stages often only contains information about events that have already occurred, a component of a simple backdoor trigger could be a model recognizing data that is in the future relative to when it was trained. Through prompting experiments and by probing internal activations, we show that current large language models (LLMs) can distinguish past from future events, with probes on model activations achieving 90% accuracy. We train models with backdoors triggered by a temporal distributional shift; they activate when the model is exposed to news headlines beyond their training cut-off dates. Fine-tuning on helpful, harmless and honest (HHH) data does not work well for removing simpler backdoor triggers but is effective on our backdoored models, although this distinction is smaller for the larger-scale model we tested. We also find that an activation-steering vector representing a model's internal representation of the date influences the rate of backdoor activation. We take these results as initial evidence that, at least for models at the modest scale we test, standard safety measures are enough to remove these backdoors.</p></details> |  |

Recently, directly trained SNNs have shown potential to match or surpass the performance of traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in classification tasks. However, in object detection tasks, directly trained SNNs still exhibit a significant performance gap compared to ANNs when tested on frame-based static object datasets (such as COCO2017). Therefore, bridging this performance gap and enabling directly trained SNNs to achieve performance comparable to ANNs on these static datasets has become one of the key challenges in the development of SNNs.To address this challenge, this paper focuses on enhancing the SNN's unique ability to process spatiotemporal information. Spiking neurons, as the core components of SNNs, facilitate the exchange of information between different temporal channels during the process of converting input floating-point data into binary spike signals. However, existing neuron models still have certain limitations in the communication of temporal information. Some studies have even suggested that disabling the backpropagation in the time dimension during SNN training can still yield good training results. To improve the SNN handling of temporal information, this paper proposes replacing traditional 2D convolutions with 3D convolutions, thus directly incorporating temporal information into the convolutional process. Additionally, temporal information recurrence mechanism is introduced within the neurons to further enhance the neurons' efficiency in utilizing temporal information.Experimental results show that the proposed method enables directly trained SNNs to achieve performance levels comparable to ANNs on the COCO2017 and VOC datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traffic flow data are spatial-temporal, which are not only correlated to spatial locations in road networks, but also vary with temporal time indices. Existing methods have solved the challenges in traffic flow prediction partly, focusing on modeling spatial-temporal dependencies effectively, while not all intrinsic properties of traffic flow data are utilized fully. Besides, there are very few attempts at incremental learning of spatial-temporal data mining, and few previous works can be easily transferred to the traffic flow prediction task. Motivated by the challenge of incremental learning methods for traffic flow prediction and the underutilization of intrinsic properties of road networks, we propose a Transport-Hub-aware Spatial-Temporal adaptive graph transFormer (H-STFormer) for traffic flow prediction. Specifically, we first design a novel spatial self-attention module to capture the dynamic spatial dependencies. Three graph masking matrices are integrated into spatial self-attentions to highlight both short- and long-term dependences. Additionally, we employ a temporal self-attention module to detect dynamic temporal patterns in the traffic flow data. Finally, we design an extra spatial-temporal knowledge distillation module for incremental learning of traffic flow prediction tasks. Through extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of H-STFormer in normal and incremental traffic flow prediction tasks.

However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an EIT-inspired Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel predictor with improved performance.

The intuitive solution leverages GroundingDINO to identify the target object from a single frame and SAM 2 to segment the identified object throughout the video, which is less robust to spatiotemporal variations due to a lack of video context exploration. Thus, in our AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline, we propose a novel GPT-assisted Pivot Selection (GPT-PS) module to instruct GPT-4 to perform two-step temporal-spatial reasoning for sequentially selecting pivot frames and pivot boxes, thereby providing SAM 2 with a high-quality initial object prompt. Within GPT-PS, two task-specific Chain-of-Thought prompts are designed to unleash GPT's temporal-spatial reasoning capacity by guiding GPT to make selections based on a comprehensive understanding of video and reference information. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Binded Reference Unification (LBRU) module to convert audio signals into language-formatted references, thereby unifying the formats of AVS and RVOS tasks in the same pipeline. Extensive experiments on both tasks show that our training-free AL-Ref-SAM 2 pipeline achieves performances comparable to or even better than fully-supervised fine-tuning methods.

Sensors like cameras and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) are significantly limited under these conditions, whereas ultrasonic sensors offer a more robust alternative. However, the low angular resolution, slow update frequency, and limited detection accuracy of ultrasonic sensors present barriers for SLAM. In this work, we propose a novel end-to-end generative ultrasonic SLAM framework. This framework employs a sensor array with overlapping fields of view, leveraging the inherently low angular resolution of ultrasonic sensors to implicitly encode spatial features in conjunction with the robot's motion. Consecutive time frame data is processed through a sliding window mechanism to capture temporal features. The spatiotemporally encoded sensor data is passed through multiple modules to generate dense scan point clouds and robot pose transformations for map construction and odometry. The main contributions of this work include a novel ultrasonic sensor array that spatiotemporally encodes the surrounding environment, and an end-to-end generative SLAM framework that overcomes the inherent defects of ultrasonic sensors. Several real-world experiments demonstrate the feasibility and robustness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures and 1 table</p></details> |

While effective for single-frame images, they struggle with dynamic changes in multi-frame scenarios as traditional spatial-temporal representations often fail to adapt. To address these challenges, we introduce a Neural-represented Spatial-Temporal Tensor (NeurSTT) model. This framework employs nonlinear networks to enhance spatial-temporal feature correlations in background approximation, thereby supporting target detection in an unsupervised manner. Specifically, we employ neural layers to approximate sequential backgrounds within a low-rank informed deep scheme. A neural three-dimensional total variation is developed to refine background smoothness while reducing static target-like clusters in sequences. Traditional sparsity constraints are incorporated into the loss functions to preserve potential targets. By replacing complex solvers with a deep updating strategy, NeurSTT simplifies the optimization process in a domain-awareness way. Visual and numerical results across various datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms detection challenges. Notably, it has 16.6$\times$ fewer parameters and averaged 19.19\% higher in $IoU$ compared to the suboptimal method on $256 \times 256$ sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[STeInFormer: Spatial-Temporal Interaction Transformer Architecture for Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17247v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks and attention mechanisms have greatly benefited remote sensing change detection (RSCD) because of their outstanding discriminative ability. Existent RSCD methods often follow a paradigm of using a non-interactive Siamese neural network for multi-temporal feature extraction and change detection heads for feature fusion and change representation. However, this paradigm lacks the contemplation of the characteristics of RSCD in temporal and spatial dimensions, and causes the drawback on spatial-temporal interaction that hinders high-quality feature extraction. To address this problem, we present STeInFormer, a spatial-temporal interaction Transformer architecture for multi-temporal feature extraction, which is the first general backbone network specifically designed for RSCD. In addition, we propose a parameter-free multi-frequency token mixer to integrate frequency-domain features that provide spectral information for RSCD. Experimental results on three datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which can outperform the state-of-the-art methods and achieve the most satisfactory efficiency-accuracy trade-off.

We propose several metrics to perform automatic speaker verification based only on phoneme durations. Experimental results demonstrate that phoneme durations leak some speaker information and can reveal speaker identity from both original and anonymized speech. Thus, this work emphasizes the importance of taking into account the speaker's speech rate and, more importantly, the speaker's phonetic duration characteristics, as well as the need to modify them in order to develop anonymization systems with strong privacy protection capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Temporal-spatial Analysis of Estimating Urban Traffic Patterns Via GPS Trace Data of Car-hailing Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07456v2)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Car-hailing services have become a prominent data source for urban traffic studies. Extracting useful information from car-hailing trace data is essential for effective traffic management, while discrepancies between car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic should be considered. This paper proposes a generic framework for estimating and analyzing urban traffic patterns using car-hailing trace data. The framework consists of three layers: the data layer, the interactive software layer, and the processing method layer. By pre-processing car-hailing GPS trace data with operations such as data cutting, map matching, and trace correction, the framework generates tensor matrices that estimate traffic patterns for car-hailing vehicle flow and average road speed. An analysis block based on these matrices examines the relationships and differences between car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic patterns, which have been overlooked in previous research. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in examining temporal-spatial patterns of car-hailing vehicles and urban traffic. For temporal analysis, urban road traffic displays a bimodal characteristic while car-hailing flow exhibits a 'multi-peak' pattern, fluctuating significantly during holidays and thus generating a hierarchical structure. For spatial analysis, the heat maps generated from the matrices exhibit certain discrepancies, but the spatial distribution of hotspots and vehicle aggregation areas remains similar.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are overwhelmed by temporal domain analysis, overlooking the valuable envelope structures of the frequency domain that are equally important for robust emotion recognition. To overcome this limitation, we propose TF-Mamba, a novel multi-domain framework that captures emotional expressions in both temporal and frequency dimensions.Concretely, we propose a temporal-frequency mamba block to extract temporal- and frequency-aware emotional features, achieving an optimal balance between computational efficiency and model expressiveness. Besides, we design a Complex Metric-Distance Triplet (CMDT) loss to enable the model to capture representative emotional clues for SER. Extensive experiments on the IEMOCAP and MELD datasets show that TF-Mamba surpasses existing methods in terms of model size and latency, providing a more practical solution for future SER applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and paves the way for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |

After Temporal Graph Networks (TGNs) were proposed, various studies have shown that TGN can significantly improve situations where the features of nodes and edges dynamically change over time. However, despite its promising capabilities, it has not been directly applied in recommender systems to date. Our study bridges this gap by directly implementing Temporal Graph Networks (TGN) in recommender systems, a first in this field.

Existing studies exploring explainable reasoning concentrate on modeling comprehensible temporal paths relevant to the query. Yet, these path-based methods primarily focus on local temporal paths appearing in recent times, failing to capture the complex temporal paths in TKG and resulting in the loss of longer historical relations related to the query. Motivated by the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science, we propose a \textbf{Cogn}itive \textbf{T}emporal \textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{E}xtrapolation framework (CognTKE), which introduces a novel temporal cognitive relation directed graph (TCR-Digraph) and performs interpretable global shallow reasoning and local deep reasoning over the TCR-Digraph. Specifically, the proposed TCR-Digraph is constituted by retrieving significant local and global historical temporal relation paths associated with the query. In addition, CognTKE presents the global shallow reasoner and the local deep reasoner to perform global one-hop temporal relation reasoning (System 1) and local complex multi-hop path reasoning (System 2) over the TCR-Digraph, respectively. The experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that CognTKE achieves significant improvement in accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art baselines and delivers excellent zero-shot reasoning ability. \textit{The code is available at https://github.com/WeiChen3690/CognTKE}.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI2...</summary><p>AAAI2025 Accept, 12 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[STKDRec: Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Distillation for Takeaway Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16502v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The takeaway recommendation system is designed to recommend users' future takeaway purchases based on their historical purchase behaviors, thereby improving user satisfaction and increasing merchant sales. Existing methods focus on incorporating auxiliary information or leveraging knowledge graphs to alleviate the sparsity issue of user purchase sequence data. However, two main challenges limit the performance of these approaches: (1) how to capture dynamic user preferences on complex geospatial information and (2) how to efficiently integrate spatial-temporal knowledge from graphs and sequence data with low calculation costs. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal knowledge distillation for takeaway recommendation model (STKDRec) based on the two-stage training process. Specifically, during the first pre-training stage, a spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) encoder is pre-trained to extract the high-order spatial-temporal and collaborative associations within the STKG. During the second STKD stage, a spatial-temporal Transformer is employed to comprehensively model dynamic user preferences on various types of fine-grained geospatial information from a sequence perspective. Furthermore, the STKD strategy is introduced to adaptively fuse the rich spatial-temporal knowledge from the pre-trained STKG encoder and the spatial-temporal transformer while reducing the cost of model training. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that our STKDRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.

| **[Signal-SGN: A Spiking Graph Convolutional Network for Skeletal Action Recognition via Learning Temporal-Frequency Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01701v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For skeleton-based action recognition, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) are effective models. Still, their reliance on floating-point computations leads to high energy consumption, limiting their applicability in battery-powered devices. While energy-efficient, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) struggle to model skeleton dynamics, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose Signal-SGN (Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which utilizes the temporal dimension of skeleton sequences as the spike time steps and represents features as multi-dimensional discrete stochastic signals for temporal-frequency domain feature extraction. It combines the 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) module and the Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) module to extract features from the skeleton represented as spiking form. Additionally, the Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Feature Fusion (MWTF) module is proposed to extract dynamic spiking features and capture frequency-specific characteristics, enhancing classification performance. Experiments across three large-scale datasets reveal Signal-SGN exceeding state-of-the-art SNN-based methods in accuracy and computational efficiency while attaining comparable performance with GCN methods and significantly reducing theoretical energy consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[THeGCN: Temporal Heterophilic Graph Convolutional Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16435v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have exhibited remarkable efficacy in diverse graph learning tasks, particularly on static homophilic graphs. Recent attention has pivoted towards more intricate structures, encompassing (1) static heterophilic graphs encountering the edge heterophily issue in the spatial domain and (2) event-based continuous graphs in the temporal domain. State-of-the-art (SOTA) has been concurrently addressing these two lines of work but tends to overlook the presence of heterophily in the temporal domain, constituting the temporal heterophily issue. Furthermore, we highlight that the edge heterophily issue and the temporal heterophily issue often co-exist in event-based continuous graphs, giving rise to the temporal edge heterophily challenge. To tackle this challenge, this paper first introduces the temporal edge heterophily measurement. Subsequently, we propose the Temporal Heterophilic Graph Convolutional Network (THeGCN), an innovative model that incorporates the low/high-pass graph signal filtering technique to accurately capture both edge (spatial) heterophily and temporal heterophily. Specifically, the THeGCN model consists of two key components: a sampler and an aggregator. The sampler selects events relevant to a node at a given moment. Then, the aggregator executes message-passing, encoding temporal information, node attributes, and edge attributes into node embeddings. Extensive experiments conducted on 5 real-world datasets validate the efficacy of THeGCN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Object Detection for Time-Lapse Imagery Using Temporal Features in Wildlife Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16329v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring animal populations is crucial for assessing the health of ecosystems. Traditional methods, which require extensive fieldwork, are increasingly being supplemented by time-lapse camera-trap imagery combined with an automatic analysis of the image data. The latter usually involves some object detector aimed at detecting relevant targets (commonly animals) in each image, followed by some postprocessing to gather activity and population data. In this paper, we show that the performance of an object detector in a single frame of a time-lapse sequence can be improved by including spatio-temporal features from the prior frames. We propose a method that leverages temporal information by integrating two additional spatial feature channels which capture stationary and non-stationary elements of the scene and consequently improve scene understanding and reduce the number of stationary false positives. The proposed technique achieves a significant improvement of 24\% in mean average precision (mAP@0.05:0.95) over the baseline (temporal feature-free, single frame) object detector on a large dataset of breeding tropical seabirds. We envisage our method will be widely applicable to other wildlife monitoring applications that use time-lapse imaging.</p></details> | 18 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Temporal Explorability Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16328v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal graphs extend ordinary graphs with discrete time that affects the availability of edges. We consider solving games played on temporal graphs where one player aims to explore the graph, i.e., visit all vertices. The complexity depends majorly on two factors: the presence of an adversary and how edge availability is specified. We demonstrate that on static graphs, where edges are always available, solving explorability games is just as hard as solving reachability games. In contrast, on temporal graphs, the complexity of explorability coincides with generalized reachability (NP-complete for one-player and PSPACE- complete for two player games). We further show that if temporal graphs are given symbolically, even one-player reachability and thus explorability and generalized reachability games are PSPACE-hard. For one player, all these are also solvable in PSPACE and for two players, they are in PSPACE, EXP and EXP, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Equivariant contrastive learning, on the other hand, provides representations sensitive to specific image transformations while remaining invariant to others. By introducing equivariance to time-induced transformations, such as disease-related anatomical changes in longitudinal imaging, the model can effectively capture such changes in the representation space. In this work, we propose a Time-equivariant Contrastive Learning (TC) method. First, an encoder embeds two unlabeled scans from different time points of the same patient into the representation space. Next, a temporal equivariance module is trained to predict the representation of a later visit based on the representation from one of the previous visits and the corresponding time interval with a novel regularization loss term while preserving the invariance property to irrelevant image transformations. On a large longitudinal dataset, our model clearly outperforms existing equivariant contrastive methods in predicting progression from intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to advanced wet-AMD within a specified time-window.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024 (early accept, top 11%)</p></details> |

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, precipitation nowcasting aims to predict precipitation at a local level within a 6-hour time frame. This task can be framed as a spatial-temporal sequence forecasting problem, where deep learning methods have been particularly effective. However, despite advancements in self-supervised learning, most successful methods for nowcasting remain fully supervised. Self-supervised learning is advantageous for pretraining models to learn representations without requiring extensive labeled data. In this work, we leverage the benefits of self-supervised learning and integrate it with spatial-temporal learning to develop a novel model, SpaT-SparK. SpaT-SparK comprises a CNN-based encoder-decoder structure pretrained with a masked image modeling (MIM) task and a translation network that captures temporal relationships among past and future precipitation maps in downstream tasks. We conducted experiments on the NL-50 dataset to evaluate the performance of SpaT-SparK. The results demonstrate that SpaT-SparK outperforms existing baseline supervised models, such as SmaAt-UNet, providing more accurate nowcasting predictions.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

However, during the execution of a MAPF plan, agents may encounter unexpected delays, which can lead to inefficiencies, deadlocks, or even collisions. To address these issues, the Switchable Temporal Plan Graph provides a framework for finding an acyclic Temporal Plan Graph with the minimum execution cost under delays, ensuring deadlock- and collision-free execution. Unfortunately, existing optimal algorithms, such as Mixed Integer Linear Programming and Graph-Based Switchable Edge Search (GSES), are often too slow for practical use. This paper introduces Improved GSES, which significantly accelerates GSES through four speedup techniques: stronger admissible heuristics, edge grouping, prioritized branching, and incremental implementation. Experiments conducted on four different map types with varying numbers of agents demonstrate that Improved GSES consistently achieves over twice the success rate of GSES and delivers up to a 30-fold speedup on instances where both methods successfully find solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14170v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge. Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Multimodal Spatial-temporal Patterns for Video Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15691v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal tracking has garnered widespread attention as a result of its ability to effectively address the inherent limitations of traditional RGB tracking. However, existing multimodal trackers mainly focus on the fusion and enhancement of spatial features or merely leverage the sparse temporal relationships between video frames. These approaches do not fully exploit the temporal correlations in multimodal videos, making it difficult to capture the dynamic changes and motion information of targets in complex scenarios. To alleviate this problem, we propose a unified multimodal spatial-temporal tracking approach named STTrack. In contrast to previous paradigms that solely relied on updating reference information, we introduced a temporal state generator (TSG) that continuously generates a sequence of tokens containing multimodal temporal information. These temporal information tokens are used to guide the localization of the target in the next time state, establish long-range contextual relationships between video frames, and capture the temporal trajectory of the target. Furthermore, at the spatial level, we introduced the mamba fusion and background suppression interactive (BSI) modules. These modules establish a dual-stage mechanism for coordinating information interaction and fusion between modalities. Extensive comparisons on five benchmark datasets illustrate that STTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance across various multimodal tracking scenarios.

Although previous respectable TSG methods have achieved remarkable success, they train each video-query pair separately and ignore the relationship between different pairs. We observe that the similar video/query content not only helps the TSG model better understand and generalize the cross-modal representation but also assists the model in locating some complex video-query pairs. Previous methods follow a single-thread framework that cannot co-train different pairs and usually spends much time re-obtaining redundant knowledge, limiting their real-world applications. To this end, in this paper, we pose a brand-new setting: Multi-Pair TSG, which aims to co-train these pairs. In particular, we propose a novel video-query co-training approach, Multi-Thread Knowledge Transfer Network, to locate a variety of video-query pairs effectively and efficiently. Firstly, we mine the spatial and temporal semantics across different queries to cooperate with each other. To learn intra- and inter-modal representations simultaneously, we design a cross-modal contrast module to explore the semantic consistency by a self-supervised strategy. To fully align visual and textual representations between different pairs, we design a prototype alignment strategy to 1) match object prototypes and phrase prototypes for spatial alignment, and 2) align activity prototypes and sentence prototypes for temporal alignment. Finally, we develop an adaptive negative selection module to adaptively generate a threshold for cross-modal matching. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Radio frequency data with rich semantic information are attracting more and more attention. Most current radar-based models take radio frequency image sequences as the input. However, these models heavily rely on convolutional neural networks and leave out the spatial-temporal semantic context during the encoding stage. To solve these problems, we propose a model called Mask-RadarNet to fully utilize the hierarchical semantic features from the input radar data. Mask-RadarNet exploits the combination of interleaved convolution and attention operations to replace the traditional architecture in transformer-based models. In addition, patch shift is introduced to the Mask-RadarNet for efficient spatial-temporal feature learning. By shifting part of patches with a specific mosaic pattern in the temporal dimension, Mask-RadarNet achieves competitive performance while reducing the computational burden of the spatial-temporal modeling. In order to capture the spatial-temporal semantic contextual information, we design the class masking attention module (CMAM) in our encoder. Moreover, a lightweight auxiliary decoder is added to our model to aggregate prior maps generated from the CMAM. Experiments on the CRUW dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to some state-of-the-art radar-based object detection algorithms. With relatively lower computational complexity and fewer parameters, the proposed Mask-RadarNet achieves higher recognition accuracy for object detection in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChangeDiff: A Multi-Temporal Change Detection Data Generator with Flexible Text Prompts via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15541v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven deep learning models have enabled tremendous progress in change detection (CD) with the support of pixel-level annotations. However, collecting diverse data and manually annotating them is costly, laborious, and knowledge-intensive. Existing generative methods for CD data synthesis show competitive potential in addressing this issue but still face the following limitations: 1) difficulty in flexibly controlling change events, 2) dependence on additional data to train the data generators, 3) focus on specific change detection tasks. To this end, this paper focuses on the semantic CD (SCD) task and develops a multi-temporal SCD data generator ChangeDiff by exploring powerful diffusion models. ChangeDiff innovatively generates change data in two steps: first, it uses text prompts and a text-to-layout (T2L) model to create continuous layouts, and then it employs layout-to-image (L2I) to convert these layouts into images. Specifically, we propose multi-class distribution-guided text prompts (MCDG-TP), allowing for layouts to be generated flexibly through controllable classes and their corresponding ratios. Subsequently, to generalize the T2L model to the proposed MCDG-TP, a class distribution refinement loss is further designed as training supervision. %For the former, a multi-classdistribution-guided text prompt (MCDG-TP) is proposed to complement via controllable classes and ratios. To generalize the text-to-image diffusion model to the proposed MCDG-TP, a class distribution refinement loss is designed as training supervision. For the latter, MCDG-TP in three modes is proposed to synthesize new layout masks from various texts. Our generated data shows significant progress in temporal continuity, spatial diversity, and quality realism, empowering change detectors with accuracy and transferability.

However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using autonomous aviation and autonomous driving case studies. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for both case studies, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

The labor-intensive nature of manual sleep scoring, demanding substantial expertise, has prompted a surge of interest in automated alternatives. Sleep studies in mice play a significant role in understanding sleep patterns and disorders and underscore the need for robust scoring methodologies. In response, this study introduces LG-Sleep, a novel subject-independent deep neural network architecture designed for mice sleep scoring through electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. LG-Sleep extracts local and global temporal transitions within EEG signals to categorize sleep data into three stages: wake, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The model leverages local and global temporal information by employing time-distributed convolutional neural networks to discern local temporal transitions in EEG data. Subsequently, features derived from the convolutional filters traverse long short-term memory blocks, capturing global transitions over extended periods. Crucially, the model is optimized in an autoencoder-decoder fashion, facilitating generalization across distinct subjects and adapting to limited training samples. Experimental findings demonstrate superior performance of LG-Sleep compared to conventional deep neural networks. Moreover, the model exhibits good performance across different sleep stages even when tasked with scoring based on limited training samples.</p></details> |  |

The key to our framework is a Fusion Block that enables bidirectional information exchange between our backbone video and audio diffusion models through a temporally-aligned self attention operation. Unlike prior work that uses feature extractors pretrained for other tasks for the conditioning signal, AV-Link can directly leverage features obtained by the complementary modality in a single framework i.e. video features to generate audio, or audio features to generate video. We extensively evaluate our design choices and demonstrate the ability of our method to achieve synchronized and high-quality audiovisual content, showcasing its potential for applications in immersive media generation.

Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to the twin threats of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal in nature. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Review-Then-Refine: A Dynamic Framework for Multi-Hop Question Answering with Temporal Adaptability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15101v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieve-augmented generation (RAG) frameworks have emerged as a promising solution to multi-hop question answering(QA) tasks since it enables large language models (LLMs) to incorporate external knowledge and mitigate their inherent knowledge deficiencies. Despite this progress, existing RAG frameworks, which usually follows the retrieve-then-read paradigm, often struggle with multi-hop QA with temporal information since it has difficulty retrieving and synthesizing accurate time-related information. To address the challenge, this paper proposes a novel framework called review-then-refine, which aims to enhance LLM performance in multi-hop QA scenarios with temporal information. Our approach begins with a review phase, where decomposed sub-queries are dynamically rewritten with temporal information, allowing for subsequent adaptive retrieval and reasoning process. In addition, we implement adaptive retrieval mechanism to minimize unnecessary retrievals, thus reducing the potential for hallucinations. In the subsequent refine phase, the LLM synthesizes the retrieved information from each sub-query along with its internal knowledge to formulate a coherent answer. Extensive experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, highlighting its potential to significantly improve multi-hop QA capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |
| **[DroughtSet: Understanding Drought Through Spatial-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15075v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drought is one of the most destructive and expensive natural disasters, severely impacting natural resources and risks by depleting water resources and diminishing agricultural yields. Under climate change, accurately predicting drought is critical for mitigating drought-induced risks. However, the intricate interplay among the physical and biological drivers that regulate droughts limits the predictability and understanding of drought, particularly at a subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) time scale. While deep learning has been demonstrated with potential in addressing climate forecasting challenges, its application to drought prediction has received relatively less attention. In this work, we propose a new dataset, DroughtSet, which integrates relevant predictive features and three drought indices from multiple remote sensing and reanalysis datasets across the contiguous United States (CONUS). DroughtSet specifically provides the machine learning community with a new real-world dataset to benchmark drought prediction models and more generally, time-series forecasting methods. Furthermore, we propose a spatial-temporal model SPDrought to predict and interpret S2S droughts. Our model learns from the spatial and temporal information of physical and biological features to predict three types of droughts simultaneously. Multiple strategies are employed to quantify the importance of physical and biological features for drought prediction. Our results provide insights for researchers to better understand the predictability and sensitivity of drought to biological and physical conditions. We aim to contribute to the climate field by proposing a new tool to predict and understand the occurrence of droughts and provide the AI community with a new benchmark to study deep learning applications in climate science.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |

In our case, the intent is to leave full creative control to sound designers with a tool that allows them to bypass the more repetitive parts of their work, thus being able to focus on the creative aspects of sound production. We achieve this presenting Stable-V2A, a two-stage model consisting of: an RMS-Mapper that estimates an envelope representative of the audio characteristics associated with the input video; and Stable-Foley, a diffusion model based on Stable Audio Open that generates audio semantically and temporally aligned with the target video. Temporal alignment is guaranteed by the use of the envelope as a ControlNet input, while semantic alignment is achieved through the use of sound representations chosen by the designer as cross-attention conditioning of the diffusion process. We train and test our model on Greatest Hits, a dataset commonly used to evaluate V2A models. In addition, to test our model on a case study of interest, we introduce Walking The Maps, a dataset of videos extracted from video games depicting animated characters walking in different locations.

| **[Temporal Logic Control for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems Under Unknown Disturbances](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11343v2)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel framework to synthesize robust strategies for discrete-time nonlinear systems with random disturbances that are unknown, against temporal logic specifications. The proposed framework is data-driven and abstraction-based: leveraging observations of the system, our approach learns a high-confidence abstraction of the system in the form of an uncertain Markov decision process (UMDP). The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented as a convex polytope obtained by a two-layer state discretization and concentration inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several case studies, showing substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, recent works integrate vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for open-vocabulary TAL (OV-TAL). However, despite the success of VLMs trained on extensive datasets, existing OV-TAL methods still rely on human-labeled TAL datasets of limited size to train action localizers, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we explore the scalability of self-training with unlabeled YouTube videos for OV-TAL. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a class-agnostic action localizer is trained on a human-labeled TAL dataset to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos, and (2) the large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset is then used to train the localizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging web-scale videos in self-training significantly enhances the generalizability of an action localizer. Additionally, we identify limitations in existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and propose a new benchmark for thorough assessment. Finally, we showcase the TAL performance of the large multimodal model Gemini-1.5 on our new benchmark.

We introduce Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution (TAR$^2$), a novel approach designed to address the agent-temporal credit assignment problem by redistributing sparse rewards both temporally and across agents. TAR$^2$ decomposes sparse global rewards into time-step-specific rewards and calculates agent-specific contributions to these rewards. We theoretically prove that TAR$^2$ is equivalent to potential-based reward shaping, ensuring that the optimal policy remains unchanged. Empirical results demonstrate that TAR$^2$ stabilizes and accelerates the learning process. Additionally, we show that when TAR$^2$ is integrated with single-agent reinforcement learning algorithms, it performs as well as or better than traditional multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Prediction-Feedback DETR for Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16729v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Action Detection (TAD) is fundamental yet challenging for real-world video applications. Leveraging the unique benefits of transformers, various DETR-based approaches have been adopted in TAD. However, it has recently been identified that the attention collapse in self-attention causes the performance degradation of DETR for TAD. Building upon previous research, this paper newly addresses the attention collapse problem in cross-attention within DETR-based TAD methods. Moreover, our findings reveal that cross-attention exhibits patterns distinct from predictions, indicating a short-cut phenomenon. To resolve this, we propose a new framework, Prediction-Feedback DETR (Pred-DETR), which utilizes predictions to restore the collapse and align the cross- and self-attention with predictions. Specifically, we devise novel prediction-feedback objectives using guidance from the relations of the predictions. As a result, Pred-DETR significantly alleviates the collapse and achieves state-of-the-art performance among DETR-based methods on various challenging benchmarks including THUMOS14, ActivityNet-v1.3, HACS, and FineAction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Although recent DETR-based models have achieved notable progress by leveraging multiple learnable moment queries, they suffer from overlapped and redundant proposals, leading to inaccurate predictions. We attribute this limitation to the lack of task-related guidance for the learnable queries to serve a specific mode. Furthermore, the complex solution space generated by variable and open-vocabulary language descriptions complicates optimization, making it harder for learnable queries to distinguish each other adaptively. To tackle this limitation, we present a Region-Guided TRansformer (RGTR) for temporal sentence grounding, which diversifies moment queries to eliminate overlapped and redundant predictions. Instead of using learnable queries, RGTR adopts a set of anchor pairs as moment queries to introduce explicit regional guidance. Each anchor pair takes charge of moment prediction for a specific temporal region, which reduces the optimization difficulty and ensures the diversity of the final predictions. In addition, we design an IoU-aware scoring head to improve proposal quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RGTR, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on QVHighlights, Charades-STA and TACoS datasets.

Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Benefiting from the abundance of unlabeled spatial-temporal data, self-supervised methods are increasingly adapted to learn spatial-temporal representations. However, it encounters three key challenges: 1) the difficulty in selecting reliable negative pairs due to the homogeneity of variables, hindering contrastive learning methods; 2) overlooking spatial correlations across variables over time; 3) limitations of efficiency and scalability in existing self-supervised learning methods. To tackle these, we propose a lightweight representation-learning model ST-ReP, integrating current value reconstruction and future value prediction into the pre-training framework for spatial-temporal forecasting. And we design a new spatial-temporal encoder to model fine-grained relationships. Moreover, multi-time scale analysis is incorporated into the self-supervised loss to enhance predictive capability. Experimental results across diverse domains demonstrate that the proposed model surpasses pre-training-based baselines, showcasing its ability to learn compact and semantically enriched representations while exhibiting superior scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 pages.

However, existing approaches cannot capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations in TKGs. To this end, we propose a Deep Evolutionary Clustering jointed temporal knowledge graph Representation Learning approach (DECRL). Specifically, a deep evolutionary clustering module is proposed to capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations among entities. Furthermore, a cluster-aware unsupervised alignment mechanism is introduced to ensure the precise one-to-one alignment of soft overlapping clusters across timestamps, thereby maintaining the temporal smoothness of clusters. In addition, an implicit correlation encoder is introduced to capture latent correlations between any pair of clusters under the guidance of a global graph. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DECRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 9.53%, 12.98%, 10.42%, and 14.68% in MRR, Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024, 17 pages, and 3 figures</p></details> |

To encode video moments of varying lengths, recent methods employ a multi-level structure known as a feature pyramid. In this structure, lower levels concentrate on short-range video moments, while higher levels address long-range moments. Because higher levels experience downsampling to accommodate increasing moment length, their capacity to capture information is reduced and consequently leads to degraded information in moment representations. To resolve this problem, we propose a contrastive learning framework to capture salient semantics among video moments. Our key methodology is to leverage samples from the feature space emanating from multiple stages of the video encoder itself requiring neither data augmentation nor online memory banks to obtain positive and negative samples. To enable such an extension, we introduce a sampling process to draw multiple video moments corresponding to a common query. Subsequently, by utilizing these moments' representations across video encoder layers, we instantiate a novel form of multi-scale and cross-scale contrastive learning that links local short-range video moments with global long-range video moments. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework for not only long-form but also short-form video grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods encode entity masks tracked across temporal dimensions (mask tubes), then predict their relations with temporal pooling operation, which does not fully utilize the motion indicative of the entities' relation. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a contrastive representation learning framework that focuses on motion pattern for temporal scene graph generation. Firstly, our framework encourages the model to learn close representations for mask tubes of similar subject-relation-object triplets. Secondly, we seek to push apart mask tubes from their temporally shuffled versions. Moreover, we also learn distant representations for mask tubes belonging to the same video but different triplets. Extensive experiments show that our motion-aware contrastive framework significantly improves state-of-the-art methods on both video and 4D datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2025</p></details> |

An example is modeling de facto care pathways that characterize common step-by-step plans for treatment or care. However, clinical event data pose several unique challenges, including the irregularity of time intervals between consecutive events, the existence of cycles, periodicity, multi-scale event interactions, and the high computational costs associated with long event sequences. Existing neural temporal point processes (TPPs) methods do not effectively capture the multi-scale nature of event interactions, which is common in many real-world clinical applications. To address these issues, we propose the cross-temporal-scale transformer (XTSFormer), specifically designed for irregularly timed event data. Our model consists of two vital components: a novel Feature-based Cycle-aware Time Positional Encoding (FCPE) that adeptly captures the cyclical nature of time, and a hierarchical multi-scale temporal attention mechanism, where different temporal scales are determined by a bottom-up clustering approach.

To support downstream tasks like autonomous control, these representations must be both compositional and temporally consistent. Existing approaches based on recurrent processing often lack long-term stability across frames because their training objective does not enforce temporal consistency. In this work, we introduce a novel object-level temporal contrastive loss for video object-centric models that explicitly promotes temporal consistency. Our method significantly improves the temporal consistency of the learned object-centric representations, yielding more reliable video decompositions that facilitate challenging downstream tasks such as unsupervised object dynamics prediction. Furthermore, the inductive bias added by our loss strongly improves object discovery, leading to state-of-the-art results on both synthetic and real-world datasets, outperforming even weakly-supervised methods that leverage motion masks as additional cues.</p></details> |  |

However, their high computational cost makes them impractical for applications requiring rapid responses or iterative processes, such as optimization, uncertainty quantification, or inverse modeling. To address this challenge, this work introduces the Dual-Stage Temporal Three-dimensional UNet Super-resolution (DST3D-UNet-SR) model, a highly efficient deep learning model for plume dispersion prediction. DST3D-UNet-SR is composed of two sequential modules: the temporal module (TM), which predicts the transient evolution of a plume in complex terrain from low-resolution temporal data, and the spatial refinement module (SRM), which subsequently enhances the spatial resolution of the TM predictions. We train DST3DUNet- SR using a comprehensive dataset derived from high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of plume transport. We propose the DST3D-UNet-SR model to significantly accelerate LES simulations of three-dimensional plume dispersion by three orders of magnitude. Additionally, the model demonstrates the ability to dynamically adapt to evolving conditions through the incorporation of new observational data, substantially improving prediction accuracy in high-concentration regions near the source.

This problem has many applications in various fields, such as financial networks and e-commerce. These relations can involve much more complexities than just involving more than two entities. One such scenario is evolving recursive relations between multiple entities, and so far, this is still an open problem. This work addresses the problem of forecasting higher-order interaction events that can be multi-relational and recursive. We pose the problem in the framework of representation learning of temporal hypergraphs that can capture complex relationships involving multiple entities. The proposed model, \textit{Relational Recursive Hyperedge Temporal Point Process} (RRHyperTPP) uses an encoder that learns a dynamic node representation based on the historical interaction patterns and then a hyperedge link prediction-based decoder to model the occurrence of interaction events. These learned representations are then used for downstream tasks involving forecasting the type and time of interactions. The main challenge in learning from hyperedge events is that the number of possible hyperedges grows exponentially with the number of nodes in the network. This will make the computation of negative log-likelihood of the temporal point process expensive, as the calculation of survival function requires a summation over all possible hyperedges. In our work, we develop a noise contrastive estimation method to learn the parameters of our model, and we have experimentally shown that our models perform better than previous state-of-the-art methods for interaction forecasting.</p></details> | AAAI-2025 |

One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |
| **[Neural Temporal Point Processes for Forecasting Directional Relations in Evolving Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12210v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting relations between entities is paramount in the current era of data and AI. However, it is often overlooked that real-world relationships are inherently directional, involve more than two entities, and can change with time. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive solution to the problem of forecasting directional relations in a general setting, where relations are higher-order, i.e., directed hyperedges in a hypergraph. This problem has not been previously explored in the existing literature. The primary challenge in solving this problem is that the number of possible hyperedges is exponential in the number of nodes at each event time. To overcome this, we propose a sequential generative approach that segments the forecasting process into multiple stages, each contingent upon the preceding stages, thereby reducing the search space involved in predictions of hyperedges. The first stage involves a temporal point process-based node event forecasting module that identifies the subset of nodes involved in an event. The second stage is a candidate generation module that predicts hyperedge sizes and adjacency vectors for nodes observing events. The final stage is a directed hyperedge predictor that identifies the truth by searching over the set of candidate hyperedges. To validate the effectiveness of our model, we compiled five datasets and conducted an extensive empirical study to assess each downstream task. Our proposed method achieves a performance gain of 32\% and 41\% compared to the state-of-the-art pairwise and hyperedge event forecasting models, respectively, for the event type prediction.</p></details> | AAAI-2025 |
| **[MoGenTS: Motion Generation based on Spatial-Temporal Joint Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17686v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion generation from discrete quantization offers many advantages over continuous regression, but at the cost of inevitable approximation errors. Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, with a 26.6% decrease of FID on HumanML3D and a 29.9% decrease on KIT-ML.

| **[Generalizing Weather Forecast to Fine-grained Temporal Scales via Physics-AI Hybrid Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13796v4)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models have made significant advancements in weather forecasting, particularly in medium-range and nowcasting. However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box systems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical evolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal scale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales. This paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which Generalizes weather forecasts to Finer-grained Temporal scales beyond training dataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate physical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel neural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we introduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of the model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules indicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections adaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly dataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple lead times and exhibits the capability to generalize 30-minute forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization under Cross-Modal Consistency and Multi-Temporal Granularity Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12628v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of audio-visual learning, most research tasks focus exclusively on short videos. This paper focuses on the more practical Dense Audio-Visual Event Localization (DAVEL) task, advancing audio-visual scene understanding for longer, untrimmed videos. This task seeks to identify and temporally pinpoint all events simultaneously occurring in both audio and visual streams. Typically, each video encompasses dense events of multiple classes, which may overlap on the timeline, each exhibiting varied durations. Given these challenges, effectively exploiting the audio-visual relations and the temporal features encoded at various granularities becomes crucial. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel CCNet, comprising two core modules: the Cross-Modal Consistency Collaboration (CMCC) and the Multi-Temporal Granularity Collaboration (MTGC). Specifically, the CMCC module contains two branches: a cross-modal interaction branch and a temporal consistency-gated branch. The former branch facilitates the aggregation of consistent event semantics across modalities through the encoding of audio-visual relations, while the latter branch guides one modality's focus to pivotal event-relevant temporal areas as discerned in the other modality. The MTGC module includes a coarse-to-fine collaboration block and a fine-to-coarse collaboration block, providing bidirectional support among coarse- and fine-grained temporal features. Extensive experiments on the UnAV-100 dataset validate our module design, resulting in a new state-of-the-art performance in dense audio-visual event localization.

| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.

Although previous typical methods have achieved commendable results, it is still challenging to retrieve short video moments. This is primarily due to the reliance on sparse and limited decoder queries, which significantly constrain the accuracy of predictions. Furthermore, suboptimal outcomes often arise because previous methods rank predictions based on isolated predictions, neglecting the broader video context. To tackle these issues, we introduce FlashVTG, a framework featuring a Temporal Feature Layering (TFL) module and an Adaptive Score Refinement (ASR) module. The TFL module replaces the traditional decoder structure to capture nuanced video content variations across multiple temporal scales, while the ASR module improves prediction ranking by integrating context from adjacent moments and multi-temporal-scale features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlashVTG achieves state-of-the-art performance on four widely adopted datasets in both MR and HD. Specifically, on the QVHighlights dataset, it boosts mAP by 5.8% for MR and 3.3% for HD. For short-moment retrieval, FlashVTG increases mAP to 125% of previous SOTA performance. All these improvements are made without adding training burdens, underscoring its effectiveness.

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods. Numerical results validate the proposed approach, demonstrating its ability to achieve a high secrecy rate while meeting the required sensing and security constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, submitted for possible publication</p></details> |

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |
| **[TrajGEOS: Trajectory Graph Enhanced Orientation-based Sequential Network for Mobility Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19092v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human mobility studies how people move to access their needed resources and plays a significant role in urban planning and location-based services. As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPER: Enhancing Career Trajectory Prediction using Temporal Knowledge Graph and Ternary Relationship](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15620v2)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of career trajectory prediction (CTP) aims to predict one's future employer or job position. While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The experiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER consistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG reasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's future companies and positions--i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more accurate predictions, respectively.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |
| **[CausalTAD: Causal Implicit Generative Model for Debiased Online Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18820v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection, aiming to estimate the anomaly risk of trajectories given the Source-Destination (SD) pairs, has become a critical problem for many real-world applications. Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Trajectories: Linking Sampling Process to Artifacts in Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17109v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detection algorithms are crucial to correcting the output generated by diffusion models. However, because of the variety of artifact forms, existing methods require substantial annotated data for training. This requirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide application. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control.

| **[Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12369v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper comprises 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, and 1 appendix.

| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

Our simulator efficiently models vehicle motion, generating trajectories that can be supervised to fit real-world data. By leveraging its differentiable nature, IDM parameters are optimized using gradient-based methods. With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Choice Between Partial Trajectories: Disentangling Goals from Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Efficient Representation Learning for Flight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16581v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory data plays a vital role in the traffic management community, especially for downstream tasks such as trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection. Existing works often utilize handcrafted features and design models for different tasks individually, which heavily rely on domain expertise and are hard to extend. We argue that different flight analysis tasks share the same useful features of the trajectory. Jointly learning a unified representation for flight trajectories could be beneficial for improving the performance of various tasks. However, flight trajectory representation learning (TRL) faces two primary challenges, \ie unbalanced behavior density and 3D spatial continuity, which disable recent general TRL methods. In this paper, we propose Flight2Vec , a flight-specific representation learning method to address these challenges. Specifically, a behavior-adaptive patching mechanism is used to inspire the learned representation to pay more attention to behavior-dense segments. Moreover, we introduce a motion trend learning technique that guides the model to memorize not only the precise locations, but also the motion trend to generate better representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Flight2Vec significantly improves performance in downstream tasks such as flight trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Aligned Network for Generalized Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05810v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial component in computer vision and robotics, but remains challenging due to the domain shift problem. Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

If a planned trajectory violates traffic rules, it is common to replan a new trajectory from scratch. We instead propose a trajectory repair technique to save computation time. By coupling satisfiability modulo theories with set-based reachability analysis, we determine if and in what manner the initial trajectory can be repaired. Experiments in high-fidelity simulators and in the real world demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach in various scenarios. Even in complex environments with intricate rules, we efficiently and reliably repair rule-violating trajectories, enabling automated vehicles to swiftly resume legally safe operation in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE.

In complex scenarios like sports, agents' trajectories are influenced by group interactions and intentions, including team strategies and opponent actions. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that integrates group-level interactions into a conditional diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse trajectories aligned with specific group activity. To capture dynamic semantic intentions, we frame group interaction prediction as a cooperative game, using Banzhaf interaction to model cooperation trends. We then fuse semantic intentions with enhanced agent embeddings, which are refined through both global and local aggregation. Furthermore, we expand the NBA SportVU dataset by adding human annotations of team-level tactics for trajectory and tactic prediction tasks. Extensive experiments on three widely-adopted datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

AdaFold extracts a particle-based representation of cloth from RGB-D images and feeds back the representation to a model predictive control to replan folding trajectory at every time step. A key component of AdaFold that enables feedback-loop manipulation is the use of semantic descriptors extracted from geometric features. These descriptors enhance the particle representation of the cloth to distinguish between ambiguous point clouds of differently folded cloths.

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[LeviTor: 3D Trajectory Oriented Image-to-Video Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15214v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intuitive nature of drag-based interaction has led to its growing adoption for controlling object trajectories in image-to-video synthesis. Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach, dubbed LeviTor, in precisely manipulating the object movements when producing photo-realistic videos from static images.

| **[STRAP: Robot Sub-Trajectory Retrieval for Augmented Policy Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15182v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robot learning is witnessing a significant increase in the size, diversity, and complexity of pre-collected datasets, mirroring trends in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision. Many robot learning methods treat such datasets as multi-task expert data and learn a multi-task, generalist policy by training broadly across them. Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder controls the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach integrated with a hysteresis inverse based on the Hammerstein modeling structure of the PFSM. The MPC is designed to decouple the rate-dependent dual-axis linear components, with an augmented error integral variable introduced in the state space to eliminate steady-state errors. Moreover, proofs of zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection are provided. The hysteresis inverse model is then cascaded to compensate for the rate-independent nonlinear components. Finally, PFSM tracking experiments are conducted on step, sinusoidal, triangular, and composite trajectories. Compared to traditional model-free and existing model-based controllers, the proposed method significantly enhances tracking accuracy, demonstrating superior tracking performance and robustness to frequency variations. These results offer valuable insights for engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPN: An Ego Vehicle Planning-Informed Network for Target Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14442v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, serving as an intermediate link between perception and planning. However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. Current trajectory prediction methods typically use the historical trajectory and vehicle attributes as inputs, focusing primarily on how historical information influences the future trajectory of the target vehicle. In real-world driving scenarios, however, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical data but also by the behavior of other vehicles on the road. To address this, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between the ego vehicle's planned trajectory and the predicted trajectory of the target vehicle. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose a target's endpoint prediction module. This module first predicts the possible endpoints of the target vehicle, then refines these predictions through a correction mechanism, and finally generates a complete multimodal predicted trajectory based on the corrected endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other trajectory prediction methods, EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE evaluation metrics on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset. These results highlight the strong performance of EPN in trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance.

However, the limited coverage and energy of UAVs make it difficult to provide timely wireless service for large-scale sensor networks, which also exist in multiple UAVs. To this end, the advanced collaboration mechanism of UAVs urgently needs to be designed. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV collaborative scheme for seamless data collection and transmission, where UAVs are dispatched to collection points (CPs) to collect and transmit the time-critical data to the ground base station (BS) simultaneously through the cooperative backhaul link. Specifically, the mission completion time is minimized by optimizing the trajectories, task allocation, collection time scheduling, and transmission topology of UAVs while ensuring backhaul link to the BS. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly. To tackle this problem, the CP locations and transmission topology of UAVs are obtained by sensor node (SN) clustering and region division. Next, the transmission connectivity condition between UAVs is derived to facilitate the trajectory discretization and thus reduce the dimensions of variables. This simplifies the problem to optimizing the UAV hovering locations, hovering time, and CP serving sequence. Then, we propose a point-matching-based trajectory planning algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the two benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to WCNC Workshop 2025</p></details> |

| **[Efficient LiDAR Bundle Adjustment for Multi-Scan Alignment Utilizing Continuous-Time Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11760v1)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constructing precise global maps is a key task in robotics and is required for localization, surveying, monitoring, or constructing digital twins. To build accurate maps, data from mobile 3D LiDAR sensors is often used. Mapping requires correctly aligning the individual point clouds to each other to obtain a globally consistent map. In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-scan alignment to obtain globally consistent point cloud maps. We propose a 3D LiDAR bundle adjustment approach to solve the global alignment problem and jointly optimize the available data. Utilizing a continuous-time trajectory allows us to consider the ego-motion of the LiDAR scanner while recording a single scan directly in the least squares adjustment. Furthermore, pruning the search space of correspondences and utilizing out-of-core circular buffer enables our approach to align thousands of point clouds efficiently. We successfully align point clouds recorded with a handheld LiDAR, as well as ones mounted on a vehicle, and are able to perform multi-session alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Traditional models often struggle with real-time processing, capturing non-linearity and uncertainty in traffic environments, efficiency in dense traffic, and modeling temporal dynamics of interactions. We introduce NEST (Neuromodulated Small-world Hypergraph Trajectory Prediction), a novel framework that integrates Small-world Networks and hypergraphs for superior interaction modeling and prediction accuracy. This integration enables the capture of both local and extended vehicle interactions, while the Neuromodulator component adapts dynamically to changing traffic conditions. We validate the NEST model on several real-world datasets, including nuScenes, MoCAD, and HighD. The results consistently demonstrate that NEST outperforms existing methods in various traffic scenarios, showcasing its exceptional generalization capability, efficiency, and temporal foresight. Our comprehensive evaluation illustrates that NEST significantly improves the reliability and operational efficiency of autonomous driving systems, making it a robust solution for trajectory prediction in complex traffic environments.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-25 |

This means that both the filtering and predicted densities for the set of targets are PMBM. In this paper, we first show that the PMBM density is also conjugate for sets of trajectories with the standard point target measurement model. Second, based on this theoretical foundation, we develop two trajectory PMBM filters that provide recursions to calculate the posterior density for the set of all trajectories that have ever been present in the surveillance area, and the posterior density of the set of trajectories present at the current time step in the surveillance area. These two filters therefore provide complete probabilistic information on the considered trajectories enabling optimal trajectory estimation. Third, we establish that the density of the set of trajectories in any time window, given the measurements in a possibly different time window, is also a PMBM. Finally, the trajectory PMBM filters are evaluated via simulations, and are shown to yield state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-target tracking algorithms based on random finite sets and multiple hypothesis tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 h rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a Toy-GS method for accurately rendering large-scale free camera trajectories. Specifically, we propose an adaptive spatial division approach for free trajectories to divide cameras and the sparse point cloud of the entire scene into various regions according to camera poses. Training each local Gaussian in parallel for each area enables us to concentrate on texture details and minimize GPU memory usage. Next, we use the multi-view constraint and position-aware point adaptive control (PPAC) to improve the rendering quality of texture details. In addition, our regional fusion approach combines local and global Gaussians to enhance rendering quality with an increasing number of divided areas. Extensive experiments have been carried out to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Toy-GS, leading to state-of-the-art results on two public large-scale datasets as well as our SCUTic dataset. Our proposal demonstrates an enhancement of 1.19 dB in PSNR and conserves 7 G of GPU memory when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of such agents is hindered by the lack of high-quality, multi-step trajectory data required for effective training. Existing approaches rely on expensive and labor-intensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. To address this challenge, we propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality GUI agent trajectories by leveraging web tutorials. Our method automatically gathers tutorial-like texts from the internet, transforms them into task goals with step-by-step instructions, and employs a visual-language model agent to simulate their execution in a real digital environment. A VLM-based evaluator ensures the correctness of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with these synthesized trajectories significantly improves their grounding and planning performance over the current models. Moreover, our approach is more cost-efficient compared to traditional human annotation methods. This work underscores the potential of guided replay with web tutorials as a viable strategy for large-scale GUI agent training, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

This study addresses this gap by introducing an online nonlinear programming trajectory optimization framework that integrates a differentiable energy model into autonomous systems. By leveraging traffic and slope profile predictions within a safety-critical framework, the proposed method enhances fuel efficiency for both sedans and diesel trucks by 3.71\% and 7.15\%, respectively, when compared to traditional model-agnostic quadratic programming techniques. These improvements translate to a potential \$6.14 billion economic benefit for the U.S. trucking industry. This work bridges the gap between model-agnostic autonomous driving and model-aware ECO-driving, highlighting a practical pathway for integrating energy efficiency into real-time trajectory planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robot Agnostic Visual Servoing considering kinematic constraints enabled by a decoupled network trajectory planner structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07017v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a visual servoing method consisting of a detection network and a velocity trajectory planner. First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Here our interest lies in understanding how individuals' health trajectories evolve in a nationwide longitudinal dataset with coded features, such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases. We introduce a straightforward approach for training a Transformer-based deep learning model in a way that lets us analyze how individuals' trajectories change over time. This is achieved by modifying the training objective and by applying a causal attention mask. We focus here on a general task of predicting the onset of a range of common diseases in a given future forecast interval. However, instead of providing a single prediction about diagnoses that could occur in this forecast interval, our approach enable the model to provide continuous predictions at every time point up until, and conditioned on, the time of the forecast period. We find that this model performs comparably to other models, including a bi-directional transformer model, in terms of basic prediction performance while at the same time offering promising trajectory modeling properties. We explore a couple of ways to use this model for analyzing health trajectories and aiding in early detection of events that forecast possible later disease onsets. We hypothesize that this method may be helpful in continuous monitoring of peoples' health trajectories and enabling interventions in ongoing health trajectories, as well as being useful in retrospective analyses.</p></details> |  |

Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance. Our approach achieves an impressive 49% reduction in trajectory end-point error (TEPE) compared to the previous state-of-the-art on the MultiFlow dataset.

However, motion plans and trajectories for soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC) dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |

Each joint has limits in the ranges of position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions, this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach with simulations and experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 pictures</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms.

However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables in a differentiable manner and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. To evaluate our method, we introduce a benchmark featuring challenging multi-finger dexterous manipulation tasks, such as screwdriver turning and in-hand reorientation. Our method outperforms baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task and a cuboid alignment task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we extend our previous work on trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs efficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with discretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally, we describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states and establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and predictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to account for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging process. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary mechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle, combining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate velocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on real-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability to generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories. This work shows the versatility of this POMDP-based approach in tackling various automated driving problems.</p></details> |  |

Despite its benefits, the efficiency of FL is often restricted by the communication quality between IoT devices and the central server. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach by deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile FL server to enhance the training process of FL. By leveraging the UAV's maneuverability, we establish robust line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, significantly improving communication capacity. To improve the overall training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's trajectory. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only outperforms existing benchmark schemes in terms of latency but also achieves training efficiency that closely approximate the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |

However, before deploying UAVs in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs, which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing close-to-optimal control performance and robustness to limited communication capabilities and measurement noises.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITPNet: Towards Instantaneous Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07369v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usually rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory to predict the future trajectory of the agents. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations are performed in real-time onboard the UAV.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 17 figures, Ocean Engineering</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse testbeds, especially under annotation-efficient regimes, (2) scaling up to multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising pre-training solution for robust motion forecasting in diverse autonomous driving contexts.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Representation for Motion Forecasting: A Scene-Specific Trajectory Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories is critical for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance (DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |

However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

While existing 3D editing methods excel at modifying color, texture, and style, they struggle with extensive geometric or appearance changes, thus limiting their applications. We propose Perturb-and-Revise, which makes possible a variety of NeRF editing. First, we perturb the NeRF parameters with random initializations to create a versatile initialization. We automatically determine the perturbation magnitude through analysis of the local loss landscape. Then, we revise the edited NeRF via generative trajectories. Combined with the generative process, we impose identity-preserving gradients to refine the edited NeRF. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Perturb-and-Revise facilitates flexible, effective, and consistent editing of color, appearance, and geometry in 3D.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we propose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable trajectories. We validate our approach through extensive experiments, demonstrating strong performances in comparison to state of-the-art methods on the ETH/UCY and SDD benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2025</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Eye Gaze Velocity Trajectories using GANs with Spectral Loss for Enhanced Fidelity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04184v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a GAN framework employing LSTM and CNN generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity.</p></details> | 16 |

The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to wave disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |

A crucial aspect, however, is to establish a formal relation between the original system and its symbolic model, ensuring that a discrete controller designed for the symbolic model can be effectively implemented as a hybrid controller (using an interface map) for the original system. This task becomes even more challenging when the exact mathematical model of the continuous-space system is unknown. To address this, the existing literature mainly employs scenario-based data-driven methods, which require collecting a large amount of data from the original system. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that utilizes only two input-state trajectories collected from unknown nonlinear polynomial systems to synthesize a hybrid controller, enabling the desired behavior on the unknown system through the controller derived from its symbolic model. To accomplish this, we employ the concept of alternating simulation functions (ASFs) to quantify the closeness between the state trajectories of the unknown system and its data-driven symbolic model. By satisfying a specific rank condition on the collected data, which intuitively ensures that the unknown system is persistently excited, we directly design an ASF and its corresponding hybrid controller using finite-length data without explicitly identifying the unknown system, while providing correctness guarantees. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, enabling a systematic approach to the design process. We illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach through a case study.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge.

Building a compact collection of pathlets, referred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting mobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down approach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset, leading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that incrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory requirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach begins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing utility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and representability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, PathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility function, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed dictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the dictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory data. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the original model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved reward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These enhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the environment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++ achieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of PathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.</p></details> |  |

Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference Research (L4DC 2025)</p></details> |

Facing the dual eavesdropping threats, we aim to enhance the average achievable secrecy rate for the communication user by jointly designing the UAV trajectory together with the transmit information and sensing beamforming, while satisfying the requirements on sensing performance and sensing security, as well as the UAV power and flight constraints. To address the non-convex nature of the optimization problem, we employ the alternating optimization (AO) strategy, jointly with the successive convex approximation (SCA) and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) methods.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at \href{https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/}{OS-Genesis Homepage}.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12570v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios. Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest, becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic internal complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures + 3 in supporting information (at the bottom of the manuscript)</p></details> |

As a paramount task of human mobility modeling, next location prediction is challenging because of the diversity of users' historical trajectories that gives rise to complex mobility patterns and various contexts. Deep sequential models have been widely used to predict the next location by leveraging the inherent sequentiality of trajectory data. However, they do not fully leverage the relationship between locations and fail to capture users' multi-level preferences. This work constructs a trajectory graph from users' historical traces and proposes a \textbf{Traj}ectory \textbf{G}raph \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{O}rientation-based \textbf{S}equential network (TrajGEOS) for next-location prediction tasks. TrajGEOS introduces hierarchical graph convolution to capture location and user embeddings. Such embeddings consider not only the contextual feature of locations but also the relation between them, and serve as additional features in downstream modules. In addition, we design an orientation-based module to learn users' mid-term preferences from sequential modeling modules and their recent trajectories. Extensive experiments on three real-world LBSN datasets corroborate the value of graph and orientation-based modules and demonstrate that TrajGEOS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the next location prediction task.</p></details> |  |

While several CTP methods have been developed for this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the mutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and company) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in career over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement patterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated temporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a graph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively preserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an extrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation.

| **[Single Trajectory Distillation for Accelerating Image and Video Style Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18945v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based stylization methods typically denoise from a specific partial noise state for image-to-image and video-to-video tasks. This multi-step diffusion process is computationally expensive and hinders real-world application. A promising solution to speed up the process is to obtain few-step consistency models through trajectory distillation. However, current consistency models only force the initial-step alignment between the probability flow ODE (PF-ODE) trajectories of the student and the imperfect teacher models. This training strategy can not ensure the consistency of whole trajectories. To address this issue, we propose single trajectory distillation (STD) starting from a specific partial noise state. We introduce a trajectory bank to store the teacher model's trajectory states, mitigating the time cost during training. Besides, we use an asymmetric adversarial loss to enhance the style and quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments on image and video stylization demonstrate that our method surpasses existing acceleration models in terms of style similarity and aesthetic evaluations. Our code and results will be available on the project page: https://single-trajectory-distillation.github.io.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions directly train a generative model for observed trajectories and calculate the conditional generative probability $P({T}|{C})$ as the anomaly risk, where ${T}$ and ${C}$ represent the trajectory and SD pair respectively. However, we argue that the observed trajectories are confounded by road network preference which is a common cause of both SD distribution and trajectories. Existing methods ignore this issue limiting their generalization ability on out-of-distribution trajectories. In this paper, we define the debiased trajectory anomaly detection problem and propose a causal implicit generative model, namely CausalTAD, to solve it. CausalTAD adopts do-calculus to eliminate the confounding bias of road network preference and estimates $P({T}|do({C}))$ as the anomaly criterion. Extensive experiments show that CausalTAD can not only achieve superior performance on trained trajectories but also generally improve the performance of out-of-distribution data, with improvements of $2.1\% \sim 5.7\%$ and $10.6\% \sim 32.7\%$ respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |

To predict the states of the system, the Holt's exponential smoothing techniques and nonlinear dynamic equations of gas pipelines are applied to establish the power and gas system equations, respectively. The square-root cubature Kalman filter algorithm is utilized to address the numerical challenges posed by the strongly nonlinear system equations. The boundary conditions in the gas system include the flow balances at sink nodes, and the mass flow rates of loads have to be predicted at each computation step. For the prediction of load mass flows, the long short-term memory network is employed, known for its effectiveness in time series prediction. Consequently, a combined method based on the square-root cubature Kalman filter and the long short-term memory network is proposed for tracking integrated gas and power systems. To evaluate the tracking performances of the proposed method, the IEEE-39 bus power system and GasLib-40 node gas system are used to form the testing system. Simulation results demonstrate high precision in tracking the dynamic states of power and gas systems. Two indexes are introduced for a numerical analysis of the tracking results, indicating that the accuracy of this method surpasses that of traditional measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

Although considerable research efforts have been made recently, the inherent trajectory uncertainty caused by various factors including the dynamic driving intends and the diverse driving scenarios still poses significant challenges to accurate trajectory prediction. To address this issue, we propose C2F-TP, a coarse-to-fine denoising framework for uncertainty-aware vehicle trajectory prediction. C2F-TP features an innovative two-stage coarse-to-fine prediction process. Specifically, in the spatial-temporal interaction stage, we propose a spatial-temporal interaction module to capture the inter-vehicle interactions and learn a multimodal trajectory distribution, from which a certain number of noisy trajectories are sampled. Next, in the trajectory refinement stage, we design a conditional denoising model to reduce the uncertainty of the sampled trajectories through a step-wise denoising operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real datasets NGSIM and highD that are widely adopted in trajectory prediction. The result demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Addressing and Visualizing Misalignments in Human Task-Solving Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14191v2)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of AI model training hinges on the quality of the trajectory data used, particularly in aligning the model's decision with human intentions. However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Similarity Trajectories: Linking Sampling Process to Artifacts in Diffusion-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17109v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detection algorithms are crucial to correcting the output generated by diffusion models. However, because of the variety of artifact forms, existing methods require substantial annotated data for training. This requirement limits their scalability and efficiency, which restricts their wide application. This paper shows that the similarity of denoised images between consecutive time steps during the sampling process is related to the severity of artifacts in images generated by diffusion models. Building on this observation, we introduce the concept of Similarity Trajectory to characterize the sampling process and its correlation with the image artifacts presented. Using an annotated data set of 680 images, which is only 0.1% of the amount of data used in the prior work, we trained a classifier on these trajectories to predict the presence of artifacts in images. By performing 10-fold validation testing on the balanced annotated data set, the classifier can achieve an accuracy of 72.35%, highlighting the connection between the Similarity Trajectory and the occurrence of artifacts. This approach enables differentiation between artifact-exhibiting and natural-looking images using limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNet Fields: Efficiently Training Hypernetworks without Ground Truth by Learning Weight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17040v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To efficiently adapt large models or to train generative models of neural representations, Hypernetworks have drawn interest. While hypernetworks work well, training them is cumbersome, and often requires ground truth optimized weights for each sample. However, obtaining each of these weights is a training problem of its own-one needs to train, e.g., adaptation weights or even an entire neural field for hypernetworks to regress to. In this work, we propose a method to train hypernetworks, without the need for any per-sample ground truth. Our key idea is to learn a Hypernetwork `Field` and estimate the entire trajectory of network weight training instead of simply its converged state. In other words, we introduce an additional input to the Hypernetwork, the convergence state, which then makes it act as a neural field that models the entire convergence pathway of a task network. A critical benefit in doing so is that the gradient of the estimated weights at any convergence state must then match the gradients of the original task -- this constraint alone is sufficient to train the Hypernetwork Field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through the task of personalized image generation and 3D shape reconstruction from images and point clouds, demonstrating competitive results without any per-sample ground truth.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swept Volume-Aware Trajectory Planning and MPC Tracking for Multi-Axle Swerve-Drive AMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16875v1)** | 2024-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-axle autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) are set to revolutionize the future of robotics in logistics. As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Efficient MPPI Trajectory Generation with Unscented Guidance: U-MPPI Control Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12369v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The classical Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control framework, while effective in many applications, lacks reliable safety features due to its reliance on a risk-neutral trajectory evaluation technique, which can present challenges for safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Furthermore, when the majority of MPPI sampled trajectories concentrate in high-cost regions, it may generate an infeasible control sequence. To address this challenge, we propose the U-MPPI control strategy, a novel methodology that can effectively manage system uncertainties while integrating a more efficient trajectory sampling strategy. The core concept is to leverage the Unscented Transform (UT) to propagate not only the mean but also the covariance of the system dynamics, going beyond the traditional MPPI method. As a result, it introduces a novel and more efficient trajectory sampling strategy, significantly enhancing state-space exploration and ultimately reducing the risk of being trapped in local minima. Furthermore, by leveraging the uncertainty information provided by UT, we incorporate a risk-sensitive cost function that explicitly accounts for risk or uncertainty throughout the trajectory evaluation process, resulting in a more resilient control system capable of handling uncertain conditions. By conducting extensive simulations of 2D aggressive autonomous navigation in both known and unknown cluttered environments, we verify the efficiency and robustness of our proposed U-MPPI control strategy compared to the baseline MPPI. We further validate the practicality of U-MPPI through real-world demonstrations in unknown cluttered environments, showcasing its superior ability to incorporate both the UT and local costmap into the optimization problem without introducing additional complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper comprises 20 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables, 1 algorithm, and 1 appendix.

| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures hidden contextual structures and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

With the capability to simulate up to 2 million vehicles in real time, the system is scalable for large-scale trajectory optimization. We show that we can use the simulator to filter noise in the input trajectories (trajectory filtering), reconstruct dense trajectories from sparse ones (trajectory reconstruction), and predict future trajectories (trajectory prediction), with all generated trajectories adhering to physical laws. We validate our simulator and algorithm on several datasets including NGSIM and Waymo Open Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Choice Between Partial Trajectories: Disentangling Goals from Beliefs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v3)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities are determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective and Efficient Representation Learning for Flight Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16581v1)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight trajectory data plays a vital role in the traffic management community, especially for downstream tasks such as trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection. Existing works often utilize handcrafted features and design models for different tasks individually, which heavily rely on domain expertise and are hard to extend. We argue that different flight analysis tasks share the same useful features of the trajectory. Jointly learning a unified representation for flight trajectories could be beneficial for improving the performance of various tasks. However, flight trajectory representation learning (TRL) faces two primary challenges, \ie unbalanced behavior density and 3D spatial continuity, which disable recent general TRL methods. In this paper, we propose Flight2Vec , a flight-specific representation learning method to address these challenges. Specifically, a behavior-adaptive patching mechanism is used to inspire the learned representation to pay more attention to behavior-dense segments. Moreover, we introduce a motion trend learning technique that guides the model to memorize not only the precise locations, but also the motion trend to generate better representations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Flight2Vec significantly improves performance in downstream tasks such as flight trajectory prediction, flight recognition, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Aligned Network for Generalized Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05810v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is a crucial component in computer vision and robotics, but remains challenging due to the domain shift problem. Previous studies have tried to tackle this problem by leveraging a portion of the trajectory data from the target domain to adapt the model. However, such domain adaptation methods are impractical in real-world scenarios, as it is infeasible to collect trajectory data from all potential target domains. In this paper, we study a task named generalized pedestrian trajectory prediction, with the aim of generalizing the model to unseen domains without accessing their trajectories. To tackle this task, we introduce a Recurrent Aligned Network~(RAN) to minimize the domain gap through domain alignment. Specifically, we devise a recurrent alignment module to effectively align the trajectory feature spaces at both time-state and time-sequence levels by the recurrent alignment strategy.Furthermore, we introduce a pre-aligned representation module to combine social interactions with the recurrent alignment strategy, which aims to consider social interactions during the alignment process instead of just target trajectories. We extensively evaluate our method and compare it with state-of-the-art methods on three widely used benchmarks. The experimental results demonstrate the superior generalization capability of our method. Our work not only fills the gap in the generalization setting for practical pedestrian trajectory prediction but also sets strong baselines in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization for Offline Preference-based Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09104v2)** | 2024-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) typically operates in two phases: first, use human preferences to learn a reward model and annotate rewards for a reward-free offline dataset; second, learn a policy by optimizing the learned reward via offline RL. However, accurately modeling step-wise rewards from trajectory-level preference feedback presents inherent challenges. The reward bias introduced, particularly the overestimation of predicted rewards, leads to optimistic trajectory stitching, which undermines the pessimism mechanism critical to the offline RL phase. To address this challenge, we propose In-Dataset Trajectory Return Regularization (DTR) for offline PbRL, which leverages conditional sequence modeling to mitigate the risk of learning inaccurate trajectory stitching under reward bias. Specifically, DTR employs Decision Transformer and TD-Learning to strike a balance between maintaining fidelity to the behavior policy with high in-dataset trajectory returns and selecting optimal actions based on high reward labels. Additionally, we introduce an ensemble normalization technique that effectively integrates multiple reward models, balancing the tradeoff between reward differentiation and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DTR over other state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, Proceedings of the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI-25)</p></details> |

In complex scenarios like sports, agents' trajectories are influenced by group interactions and intentions, including team strategies and opponent actions. To this end, we propose a novel diffusion-based trajectory prediction framework that integrates group-level interactions into a conditional diffusion model, enabling the generation of diverse trajectories aligned with specific group activity. To capture dynamic semantic intentions, we frame group interaction prediction as a cooperative game, using Banzhaf interaction to model cooperation trends. We then fuse semantic intentions with enhanced agent embeddings, which are refined through both global and local aggregation. Furthermore, we expand the NBA SportVU dataset by adding human annotations of team-level tactics for trajectory and tactic prediction tasks.

| **[Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Trajectory Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15429v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for learning safe behaviors without engaging in risky online interactions with the environment. Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Still, existing methods that perform dragging in the 2D space usually face ambiguity when handling out-of-plane movements. In this work, we augment the interaction with a new dimension, i.e., the depth dimension, such that users are allowed to assign a relative depth for each point on the trajectory. That way, our new interaction paradigm not only inherits the convenience from 2D dragging, but facilitates trajectory control in the 3D space, broadening the scope of creativity. We propose a pioneering method for 3D trajectory control in image-to-video synthesis by abstracting object masks into a few cluster points. These points, accompanied by the depth information and the instance information, are finally fed into a video diffusion model as the control signal.

Notably, while these generalist policies can improve the average performance across many tasks, the performance of generalist policies on any one task is often suboptimal due to negative transfer between partitions of the data, compared to task-specific specialist policies. In this work, we argue for the paradigm of training policies during deployment given the scenarios they encounter: rather than deploying pre-trained policies to unseen problems in a zero-shot manner, we non-parametrically retrieve and train models directly on relevant data at test time. Furthermore, we show that many robotics tasks share considerable amounts of low-level behaviors and that retrieval at the "sub"-trajectory granularity enables significantly improved data utilization, generalization, and robustness in adapting policies to novel problems. In contrast, existing full-trajectory retrieval methods tend to underutilize the data and miss out on shared cross-task content. This work proposes STRAP, a technique for leveraging pre-trained vision foundation models and dynamic time warping to retrieve sub-sequences of trajectories from large training corpora in a robust fashion. STRAP outperforms both prior retrieval algorithms and multi-task learning methods in simulated and real experiments, showing the ability to scale to much larger offline datasets in the real world as well as the ability to learn robust control policies with just a handful of real-world demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website at https://weirdlabuw.github.io/strap/</p></details> |

Diffusion is an iterative algorithm in which samples are generated step-by-step, starting from pure noise. This process introduces the notion of diffusion trajectories, i.e., paths from the standard Gaussian distribution to the target image distribution. In this context, we study discriminative algorithms operating on these trajectories. Specifically, given a pre-trained diffusion model, we consider the problem of classifying images as part of the training dataset, generated by the model or originating from an external source. Our approach demonstrates the presence of patterns across steps that can be leveraged for classification. We also conduct ablation studies, which reveal that using higher-order gradient features to characterize the trajectories leads to significant performance gains and more robust algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction with Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18551v3)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous driving as it aims to forecast the future movements of traffic participants. Traditional methods usually perform holistic inference on the trajectories of agents, neglecting the differences in prediction difficulty among agents. This paper proposes a novel Difficulty-Guided Feature Enhancement Network (DGFNet), which leverages the prediction difficulty differences among agents for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Firstly, we employ spatio-temporal feature encoding and interaction to capture rich spatio-temporal features. Secondly, a difficulty-guided decoder controls the flow of future trajectories into subsequent modules, obtaining reliable future trajectories. Then, feature interaction and fusion are performed through the future feature interaction module. Finally, the fused agent features are fed into the final predictor to generate the predicted trajectory distributions for multiple participants. Experimental results demonstrate that our DGFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Argoverse 1\&2 motion forecasting benchmarks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each module. Moreover, compared with SOTA methods, our method balances trajectory prediction accuracy and real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Accuracy Model Predictive Control with Inverse Hysteresis for High-Speed Trajectory Tracking of Piezoelectric Fast Steering Mirror](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14511v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Piezoelectric fast steering mirrors (PFSM) are widely utilized in beam precision-pointing systems but encounter considerable challenges in achieving high-precision tracking of fast trajectories due to nonlinear hysteresis and mechanical dual-axis cross-coupling. This paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) approach integrated with a hysteresis inverse based on the Hammerstein modeling structure of the PFSM. The MPC is designed to decouple the rate-dependent dual-axis linear components, with an augmented error integral variable introduced in the state space to eliminate steady-state errors. Moreover, proofs of zero steady-state error and disturbance rejection are provided. The hysteresis inverse model is then cascaded to compensate for the rate-independent nonlinear components. Finally, PFSM tracking experiments are conducted on step, sinusoidal, triangular, and composite trajectories. Compared to traditional model-free and existing model-based controllers, the proposed method significantly enhances tracking accuracy, demonstrating superior tracking performance and robustness to frequency variations. These results offer valuable insights for engineering applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPN: An Ego Vehicle Planning-Informed Network for Target Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14442v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays a crucial role in improving the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles, serving as an intermediate link between perception and planning. However, due to the highly dynamic and multimodal nature of the task, accurately predicting the future trajectory of a target vehicle remains a significant challenge. To address these challenges, we propose an Ego vehicle Planning-informed Network (EPN) for multimodal trajectory prediction. Current trajectory prediction methods typically use the historical trajectory and vehicle attributes as inputs, focusing primarily on how historical information influences the future trajectory of the target vehicle. In real-world driving scenarios, however, the future trajectory of a vehicle is influenced not only by its own historical data but also by the behavior of other vehicles on the road. To address this, we incorporate the future planned trajectory of the ego vehicle as an additional input to simulate the mutual influence between the ego vehicle's planned trajectory and the predicted trajectory of the target vehicle. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of intention ambiguity and large prediction errors often encountered in methods based on driving intentions, we propose a target's endpoint prediction module. This module first predicts the possible endpoints of the target vehicle, then refines these predictions through a correction mechanism, and finally generates a complete multimodal predicted trajectory based on the corrected endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to other trajectory prediction methods, EPN achieves an average reduction of 34.9%, 30.7%, and 30.4% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE evaluation metrics on the NGSIM dataset, and an average reduction of 64.6%, 64.5%, and 64.3% in RMSE, ADE, and FDE on the HighD dataset. These results highlight the strong performance of EPN in trajectory prediction.</p></details> |  |

To overcome these challenges, we propose the RElevance, Proximity, and Validation-Enhanced Cooperative Language Agent (REVECA), a novel cognitive architecture powered by GPT-4o-mini. REVECA enables efficient memory management, optimal planning, and cost-effective prevention of false planning by leveraging Relevance Estimation, Adaptive Planning, and Trajectory-based Validation.

Factors such as demographics, genetic conditions, and lifestyle contribute to diverse phenotypical manifestations, necessitating patient stratification based on these variations. Recent methods like Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) have advanced unsupervised stratification of disease trajectories, but they face potential limitations in robustness, interpretability, and temporal granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce Disease Progression Modelling and Stratification (DP-MoSt), a novel probabilistic method that optimises clusters of continuous trajectories over a long-term disease time-axis while estimating the confidence of trajectory sub-types for each biomarker. We validate DP-MoSt using both synthetic and real-world data from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI). Our results demonstrate that DP-MoSt effectively identifies both sub-trajectories and subpopulations, and is a promising alternative to current state-of-the-art models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Longi...</summary><p>Longitudinal Disease Tracking and Modelling with Medical Images and Data, Oct 2024, Marrachech, Morocco</p></details> |

This work explores the integration of Transformer based model with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based technique to enhance spatial and temporal feature learning in vehicle trajectory prediction. Here, a hybrid model that combines LSTMs for temporal encoding with a Transformer encoder for capturing complex interactions between vehicles is proposed. Spatial trajectory features of the neighboring vehicles are processed and goes through a masked scatter mechanism in a grid based environment, which is then combined with temporal trajectory of the vehicles. This combined trajectory data are learned by sequential LSTM encoding and Transformer based attention layers. The proposed model is benchmarked against predecessor LSTM based methods, including STA-LSTM, SA-LSTM, CS-LSTM, and NaiveLSTM. Our results, while not outperforming it's predecessor, demonstrate the potential of integrating Transformers with LSTM based technique to build interpretable trajectory prediction model. Future work will explore alternative architectures using Transformer applications to further enhance performance. This study provides a promising direction for improving trajectory prediction models by leveraging transformer based architectures, paving the way for more robust and interpretable vehicle trajectory prediction system.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we introduce conditions for the safe operation of feedback optimization based controllers. We use the feasible operating region of a controlled system as bounds for safe system states and evaluate the trajectories of the controller based on the projection of the full system state onto the two-dimensional PQ-plane. We demonstrate the defined conditions for an exemplary sub-transmission system. We show that the proposed method is suitable to evaluate controller performance and robustness for systems subject to disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-UAV Collaborative Trajectory Planning for Seamless Data Collection and Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12494v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have attracted plenty of attention due to their high flexibility and enhanced communication ability. However, the limited coverage and energy of UAVs make it difficult to provide timely wireless service for large-scale sensor networks, which also exist in multiple UAVs. To this end, the advanced collaboration mechanism of UAVs urgently needs to be designed. In this paper, we propose a multi-UAV collaborative scheme for seamless data collection and transmission, where UAVs are dispatched to collection points (CPs) to collect and transmit the time-critical data to the ground base station (BS) simultaneously through the cooperative backhaul link. Specifically, the mission completion time is minimized by optimizing the trajectories, task allocation, collection time scheduling, and transmission topology of UAVs while ensuring backhaul link to the BS. However, the formulated problem is non-convex and challenging to solve directly. To tackle this problem, the CP locations and transmission topology of UAVs are obtained by sensor node (SN) clustering and region division. Next, the transmission connectivity condition between UAVs is derived to facilitate the trajectory discretization and thus reduce the dimensions of variables. This simplifies the problem to optimizing the UAV hovering locations, hovering time, and CP serving sequence. Then, we propose a point-matching-based trajectory planning algorithm to solve the problem efficiently. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves significant performance gains over the two benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to WCNC Workshop 2025</p></details> |

This work presents a preliminary study for differentiating individual motion patterns using a dataset of 3D upper-limb transport trajectories measured in task-space. Identifying individuals by deep time series learning can be a key step to abstracting individual motion properties. In this study, a classification accuracy of about 95% is reached for a subset of nine, and about 78% for the full set of 31 individuals. This provides insights into the separability of patient attributes by exerting a simple standardized task to be transferred to portable systems.</p></details> |  |

To build accurate maps, data from mobile 3D LiDAR sensors is often used. Mapping requires correctly aligning the individual point clouds to each other to obtain a globally consistent map. In this paper, we investigate the problem of multi-scan alignment to obtain globally consistent point cloud maps. We propose a 3D LiDAR bundle adjustment approach to solve the global alignment problem and jointly optimize the available data. Utilizing a continuous-time trajectory allows us to consider the ego-motion of the LiDAR scanner while recording a single scan directly in the least squares adjustment. Furthermore, pruning the search space of correspondences and utilizing out-of-core circular buffer enables our approach to align thousands of point clouds efficiently. We successfully align point clouds recorded with a handheld LiDAR, as well as ones mounted on a vehicle, and are able to perform multi-session alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Traditional models often struggle with real-time processing, capturing non-linearity and uncertainty in traffic environments, efficiency in dense traffic, and modeling temporal dynamics of interactions. We introduce NEST (Neuromodulated Small-world Hypergraph Trajectory Prediction), a novel framework that integrates Small-world Networks and hypergraphs for superior interaction modeling and prediction accuracy. This integration enables the capture of both local and extended vehicle interactions, while the Neuromodulator component adapts dynamically to changing traffic conditions. We validate the NEST model on several real-world datasets, including nuScenes, MoCAD, and HighD. The results consistently demonstrate that NEST outperforms existing methods in various traffic scenarios, showcasing its exceptional generalization capability, efficiency, and temporal foresight. Our comprehensive evaluation illustrates that NEST significantly improves the reliability and operational efficiency of autonomous driving systems, making it a robust solution for trajectory prediction in complex traffic environments.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI-25 |

This means that both the filtering and predicted densities for the set of targets are PMBM. In this paper, we first show that the PMBM density is also conjugate for sets of trajectories with the standard point target measurement model. Second, based on this theoretical foundation, we develop two trajectory PMBM filters that provide recursions to calculate the posterior density for the set of all trajectories that have ever been present in the surveillance area, and the posterior density of the set of trajectories present at the current time step in the surveillance area. These two filters therefore provide complete probabilistic information on the considered trajectories enabling optimal trajectory estimation. Third, we establish that the density of the set of trajectories in any time window, given the measurements in a possibly different time window, is also a PMBM. Finally, the trajectory PMBM filters are evaluated via simulations, and are shown to yield state-of-the-art performance compared to other multi-target tracking algorithms based on random finite sets and multiple hypothesis tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.

A battery energy storage system (BESS) is commonly used to manage these demand charges. Economic model predictive control (EMPC) with a reference trajectory can be used to dispatch the BESS to optimize the microgrid operating cost. Since demand charges are incurred monthly, EMPC requires a full-month reference trajectory for asymptotic stability guarantees that result in optimal operating costs. However, a full-month reference trajectory is unrealistic from a renewable generation forecast perspective. Therefore, to construct a practical EMPC with a reference trajectory, an EMPC formulation considering both non-coincident demand and on-peak demand charges is designed in this work for 24 to 48 h prediction horizons. The corresponding reference trajectory is computed at each EMPC step by solving an optimal control problem over 24 to 48 h reference (trajectory) horizon. Furthermore, BESS state of charge regulation constraints are incorporated to guarantee the BESS energy level in the long term. Multiple reference and prediction horizon lengths are compared for both shrinking and rolling horizons with real-world data. The proposed EMPC with 48 h rolling reference and prediction horizons outperforms the traditional EMPC benchmark with a 2% reduction in the annual cost, proving its economic benefits.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables, Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a Toy-GS method for accurately rendering large-scale free camera trajectories. Specifically, we propose an adaptive spatial division approach for free trajectories to divide cameras and the sparse point cloud of the entire scene into various regions according to camera poses. Training each local Gaussian in parallel for each area enables us to concentrate on texture details and minimize GPU memory usage. Next, we use the multi-view constraint and position-aware point adaptive control (PPAC) to improve the rendering quality of texture details. In addition, our regional fusion approach combines local and global Gaussians to enhance rendering quality with an increasing number of divided areas. Extensive experiments have been carried out to confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of Toy-GS, leading to state-of-the-art results on two public large-scale datasets as well as our SCUTic dataset. Our proposal demonstrates an enhancement of 1.19 dB in PSNR and conserves 7 G of GPU memory when compared to various benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, the development of such agents is hindered by the lack of high-quality, multi-step trajectory data required for effective training. Existing approaches rely on expensive and labor-intensive human annotation, making them unsustainable at scale. To address this challenge, we propose AgentTrek, a scalable data synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality GUI agent trajectories by leveraging web tutorials. Our method automatically gathers tutorial-like texts from the internet, transforms them into task goals with step-by-step instructions, and employs a visual-language model agent to simulate their execution in a real digital environment. A VLM-based evaluator ensures the correctness of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with these synthesized trajectories significantly improves their grounding and planning performance over the current models. Moreover, our approach is more cost-efficient compared to traditional human annotation methods. This work underscores the potential of guided replay with web tutorials as a viable strategy for large-scale GUI agent training, paving the way for more capable and autonomous digital agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://agenttrek.github.io</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

This paper delves into the development of an innovative Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) framework, specifically tailored for beamforming and trajectory prediction processes. Central to this research is the exploration of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-enabled communication system, which seamlessly integrates ISAC technology. This integration underscores the synergistic interplay between sensing and communication capabilities. The proposed system initially deploys omnidirectional beams for the sensing-focused phase, subsequently transitioning to directional beams for precise object tracking. This process incorporates an Extended Kalman Filtering (EKF) methodology for the accurate estimation and prediction of object states. A novel frame structure is introduced, employing historical sensing data to optimize beamforming in real-time for subsequent time slots, a strategy we refer to as 'temporal-assisted' beamforming. To refine the temporal-assisted beamforming technique, we employ Successive Convex Approximation (SCA) in tandem with Iterative Rank Minimization (IRM), yielding high-quality suboptimal solutions. Comparative analysis with conventional pilot-based systems reveals that our approach yields a substantial improvement of 156\% in multi-object scenarios and 136\% in single-object scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Giving constraints in natural language form has great potential for practical scenarios due to its flexible transfer capability and accessibility. Previous safe RL methods with natural language constraints typically need to design cost functions manually for each constraint, which requires domain expertise and lacks flexibility. In this paper, we harness the dual role of text in this task, using it not only to provide constraint but also as a training signal. We introduce the Trajectory-level Textual Constraints Translator (TTCT) to replace the manually designed cost function. Our empirical results demonstrate that TTCT effectively comprehends textual constraint and trajectory, and the policies trained by TTCT can achieve a lower violation rate than the standard cost function. Extra studies are conducted to demonstrate that the TTCT has zero-shot transfer capability to adapt to constraint-shift environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Here our interest lies in understanding how individuals' health trajectories evolve in a nationwide longitudinal dataset with coded features, such as clinical codes, procedures, and drug purchases. We introduce a straightforward approach for training a Transformer-based deep learning model in a way that lets us analyze how individuals' trajectories change over time. This is achieved by modifying the training objective and by applying a causal attention mask. We focus here on a general task of predicting the onset of a range of common diseases in a given future forecast interval. However, instead of providing a single prediction about diagnoses that could occur in this forecast interval, our approach enable the model to provide continuous predictions at every time point up until, and conditioned on, the time of the forecast period. We find that this model performs comparably to other models, including a bi-directional transformer model, in terms of basic prediction performance while at the same time offering promising trajectory modeling properties. We explore a couple of ways to use this model for analyzing health trajectories and aiding in early detection of events that forecast possible later disease onsets. We hypothesize that this method may be helpful in continuous monitoring of peoples' health trajectories and enabling interventions in ongoing health trajectories, as well as being useful in retrospective analyses.</p></details> |  |

Moving objects trigger events with precise timestamps along their trajectory, enabling smooth continuous-time estimation. However, few works have attempted to optimize the information loss during event representation construction, imposing a ceiling on this task. Fully exploiting event cameras requires representations that simultaneously preserve fine-grained temporal information, stable and characteristic 2D visual features, and temporally consistent information density, an unmet challenge in existing representations. We introduce Labits: Layered Bidirectional Time Surfaces, a simple yet elegant representation designed to retain all these features. Additionally, we propose a dedicated module for extracting active pixel local optical flow (APLOF), significantly boosting the performance.

It highlights the collaborative management of four-dimensional flight trajectories, serving as a common reference for decision-making among stakeholders, including Air Navigation Service Providers (ANSPs), airspace users, and airport operators. Key enabling technologies such as Performance Based Navigation (PBN), data communications, and System-wide Information Management (SWIM) are discussed, showcasing their roles in rapid information exchange and trajectory optimization.

| **[Real-Time Trajectory Generation for Soft Robot Manipulators Using Differential Flatness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08568v1)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soft robots have the potential to interact with sensitive environments and perform complex tasks effectively. However, motion plans and trajectories for soft manipulators are challenging to calculate due to their deformable nature and nonlinear dynamics. This article introduces a fast real-time trajectory generation approach for soft robot manipulators, which creates dynamically-feasible motions for arbitrary kinematically-feasible paths of the robot's end effector. Our insight is that piecewise constant curvature (PCC) dynamics models of soft robots can be differentially flat, therefore control inputs can be calculated algebraically rather than through a nonlinear differential equation. We prove this flatness under certain conditions, with the curvatures of the robot as the flat outputs. Our two-step trajectory generation approach uses an inverse kinematics procedure to calculate a motion plan of robot curvatures per end-effector position, then, our flatness diffeomorphism generates corresponding control inputs that respect velocity. We validate our approach through simulations of our representative soft robot manipulator along three different trajectories, demonstrating a margin of 23x faster than real-time at a frequency of 100 Hz. This approach could allow fast verifiable replanning of soft robots' motions in safety-critical physical environments, crucial for deployment in the real world.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bi-Level Optimization Approach to Joint Trajectory Optimization for Redundant Manipulators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07859v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present an approach to minimizing the time necessary for the end-effector of a redundant robot manipulator to traverse a Cartesian path by optimizing the trajectory of its joints. Each joint has limits in the ranges of position, velocity and acceleration, the latter making jerks in joint space undesirable. The proposed approach takes this nonlinear optimization problem whose variables are path speed and joint trajectory and reformulates it into a bi-level problem. The lower-level formulation is a convex subproblem that considers a fixed joint trajectory and maximizes path speed while considering all joint velocity and acceleration constraints. Under particular conditions, this subproblem has a closed-form solution. Then, we solve a higher-level subproblem by leveraging the directional derivative of the lower-level value with respect to the joint trajectory parameters. In particular, we use this direction to implement a Primal-Dual method that considers the path accuracy and joint position constraints. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach with simulations and experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 14 pictures</p></details> |

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

| **[TraSCE: Trajectory Steering for Concept Erasure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07658v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have brought them to the public spotlight, becoming widely accessible and embraced by everyday users. However, these models have been shown to generate harmful content such as not-safe-for-work (NSFW) images. While approaches have been proposed to erase such abstract concepts from the models, jail-breaking techniques have succeeded in bypassing such safety measures. In this paper, we propose TraSCE, an approach to guide the diffusion trajectory away from generating harmful content. Our approach is based on negative prompting, but as we show in this paper, conventional negative prompting is not a complete solution and can easily be bypassed in some corner cases. To address this issue, we first propose a modification of conventional negative prompting. Furthermore, we introduce a localized loss-based guidance that enhances the modified negative prompting technique by steering the diffusion trajectory. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on various benchmarks in removing harmful content including ones proposed by red teams; and erasing artistic styles and objects. Our proposed approach does not require any training, weight modifications, or training data (both image or prompt), making it easier for model owners to erase new concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-finger Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization with Differentiable Rolling and Geometric Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13229v2)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameterizing finger rolling and finger-object contacts in a differentiable manner is important for formulating dexterous manipulation as a trajectory optimization problem. In contrast to previous methods which often assume simplified geometries of the robot and object or do not explicitly model finger rolling, we propose a method to further extend the capabilities of dexterous manipulation by accounting for non-trivial geometries of both the robot and the object. By integrating the object's Signed Distance Field (SDF) with a sampling method, our method estimates contact and rolling-related variables in a differentiable manner and includes those in a trajectory optimization framework. This formulation naturally allows for the emergence of finger-rolling behaviors, enabling the robot to locally adjust the contact points. To evaluate our method, we introduce a benchmark featuring challenging multi-finger dexterous manipulation tasks, such as screwdriver turning and in-hand reorientation. Our method outperforms baselines in terms of achieving desired object configurations and avoiding dropping the object. We also successfully apply our method to a real-world screwdriver turning task and a cuboid alignment task, demonstrating its robustness to the sim2real gap.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we extend our previous work on trajectory planning at unsignalized intersections using Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs). The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm, an approximate sampling-based approach to solve POMDPs efficiently. We outline the POMDP formulation process, beginning with discretizing the highway topology to reduce problem complexity. Additionally, we describe the dynamics and measurement models used to predict future states and establish the relationship between available noisy measurements and predictions. Building on our previous work, the dynamics model is expanded to account for lateral movements necessary for lane changes during the merging process. We also define the reward function, which serves as the primary mechanism for specifying the desired behavior of the automated vehicle, combining multiple goals such as avoiding collisions or maintaining appropriate velocity. Our simulation results, conducted on three scenarios based on real-life traffic data from German highways, demonstrate the method's ability to generate safe, collision-free, and efficient merging trajectories. This work shows the versatility of this POMDP-based approach in tackling various automated driving problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[When UAV Meets Federated Learning: Latency Minimization via Joint Trajectory Design and Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07428v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a pivotal solution for training machine learning models over wireless networks, particularly for Internet of Things (IoT) devices with limited computation resources. Despite its benefits, the efficiency of FL is often restricted by the communication quality between IoT devices and the central server. To address this issue, we introduce an innovative approach by deploying an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) as a mobile FL server to enhance the training process of FL. By leveraging the UAV's maneuverability, we establish robust line-of-sight connections with IoT devices, significantly improving communication capacity. To improve the overall training efficiency, we formulate a latency minimization problem by jointly optimizing the bandwidth allocation, computing frequencies, transmit power for both the UAV and IoT devices, and the UAV's trajectory. Then, an efficient alternating optimization algorithm is developed to solve it efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the convergence and computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed scheme not only outperforms existing benchmark schemes in terms of latency but also achieves training efficiency that closely approximate the ideal scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been submitted to IEEE</p></details> |

However, before deploying UAVs in the real world, it is essential to ensure they can operate safely in complex environments, especially with limited communication capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a control-aware learning-based trajectory prediction algorithm that can enable communication-efficient UAV swarm control in a cluttered environment. Specifically, our proposed algorithm can enable each UAV to predict the planned trajectories of its neighbors in scenarios with various levels of communication capabilities. The predicted planned trajectories will serve as input to a distributed model predictive control (DMPC) approach. The proposed algorithm combines (1) a trajectory prediction model based on EvolveGCN, a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) that can handle dynamic graphs, which is further enhanced by compressed messages from adjacent UAVs, and (2) a KKT-informed training approach that applies the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions in the training process to encode DMPC information into the trained neural network. We evaluate our proposed algorithm in a funnel-like environment. Results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, providing close-to-optimal control performance and robustness to limited communication capabilities and measurement noises.</p></details> |  |
| **[ITPNet: Towards Instantaneous Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07369v1)** | 2024-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction of agents is crucial for the safety of autonomous vehicles, whereas previous approaches usually rely on sufficiently long-observed trajectory to predict the future trajectory of the agents. However, in real-world scenarios, it is not realistic to collect adequate observed locations for moving agents, leading to the collapse of most prediction models. For instance, when a moving car suddenly appears and is very close to an autonomous vehicle because of the obstruction, it is quite necessary for the autonomous vehicle to quickly and accurately predict the future trajectories of the car with limited observed trajectory locations. In light of this, we focus on investigating the task of instantaneous trajectory prediction, i.e., two observed locations are available during inference. To this end, we propose a general and plug-and-play instantaneous trajectory prediction approach, called ITPNet. Specifically, we propose a backward forecasting mechanism to reversely predict the latent feature representations of unobserved historical trajectories of the agent based on its two observed locations and then leverage them as complementary information for future trajectory prediction. Meanwhile, due to the inevitable existence of noise and redundancy in the predicted latent feature representations, we further devise a Noise Redundancy Reduction Former, aiming at to filter out noise and redundancy from unobserved trajectories and integrate the filtered features and observed features into a compact query for future trajectory predictions. In essence, ITPNet can be naturally compatible with existing trajectory prediction models, enabling them to gracefully handle the case of instantaneous trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse and nuScenes datasets demonstrate ITPNet outperforms the baselines, and its efficacy with different trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

The trajectory generation exploits the state predictions of the USV to create periodically updated trajectories for a multirotor UAV to precisely land on the deck of a moving USV even in cases where the deck's inclination is continuously changing. We use an MPC-based scheme to create trajectories that consider both the UAV dynamics and the predicted states of the USV up to the first derivative of position and orientation. Compared to existing approaches, our method dynamically modifies the penalization matrices to precisely follow the corresponding states with respect to the flight phase. Especially during the landing maneuver, the UAV synchronizes attitude with the USV's, allowing for fast landing on a tilted deck. Simulations show the method's reliability in various sea conditions up to Rough sea (wave height 4 m), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in landing speed and accuracy, with twice the precision on average. Finally, real-world experiments validate the simulation results, demonstrating robust landings on a moving USV, while all computations are performed in real-time onboard the UAV.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 17 figures, Ocean Engineering</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate a mixed strategy in MF training that first pre-train motion forecasters on pseudo-labeled data, then fine-tune them on annotated data. To obtain pseudo-labeled trajectories, we propose a simple pipeline that leverages off-the-shelf single-frame 3D object detectors and non-learning trackers. The whole pre-training strategy including pseudo-labeling is coined as PPT. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) combining PPT with supervised fine-tuning on annotated data achieves superior performance on diverse testbeds, especially under annotation-efficient regimes, (2) scaling up to multiple datasets improves the previous state-of-the-art and (3) PPT helps enhance cross-dataset generalization. Our findings showcase PPT as a promising pre-training solution for robust motion forecasting in diverse autonomous driving contexts.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we have employed a method based on the Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) framework designed for planning under uncertainty. The method utilizes the Adaptive Belief Tree (ABT) algorithm as an approximate solver for the POMDPs. We outline the POMDP formulation, beginning with discretizing the intersection's topology. Additionally, we present a dynamics model for the prediction of the evolving states of vehicles, such as their position and velocity. Using an observation model, we also describe the connection of those states with the imperfect (noisy) available measurements. Our results confirmed that the method is able to plan collision-free trajectories in a series of simulations utilizing real-world traffic data from aerial footage of two distinct intersections. Furthermore, we studied the impact of parameter adjustments of the ABT algorithm on the method's performance. This provides guidance in determining reasonable parameter settings, which is valuable for future method applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v3)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we discuss two algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called deterministic trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms can be derived from an emerging theoretical paradigm that we refer to as probabilistic optimal control. The paradigm reformulates stochastic optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem and can be viewed as a generalisation of the former. The merit of this perspective is that it allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. It is shown that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of the algorithms is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Data Representation for Motion Forecasting: A Scene-Specific Trajectory Set Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20732v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing diverse and plausible future trajectories is critical for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. However, efficiently capturing these trajectories in a compact set remains challenging. This study introduces a novel approach for generating scene-specific trajectory sets tailored to different contexts, such as intersections and straight roads, by leveraging map information and actor dynamics. A deterministic goal sampling algorithm identifies relevant map regions, while our Recursive In-Distribution Subsampling (RIDS) method enhances trajectory plausibility by condensing redundant representations. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 10% improvement in Driving Area Compliance (DAC) compared to baseline methods while maintaining competitive displacement errors. Our work highlights the benefits of mining such scene-aware trajectory sets and how they could capture the complex and heterogeneous nature of actor behavior in real-world driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Soft Driving Constraints from Vectorized Scene Embeddings while Imitating Expert Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05717v1)** | 2024-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary goal of motion planning is to generate safe and efficient trajectories for vehicles. Traditionally, motion planning models are trained using imitation learning to mimic the behavior of human experts. However, these models often lack interpretability and fail to provide clear justifications for their decisions. We propose a method that integrates constraint learning into imitation learning by extracting driving constraints from expert trajectories. Our approach utilizes vectorized scene embeddings that capture critical spatial and temporal features, enabling the model to identify and generalize constraints across various driving scenarios. We formulate the constraint learning problem using a maximum entropy model, which scores the motion planner's trajectories based on their similarity to the expert trajectory. By separating the scoring process into distinct reward and constraint streams, we improve both the interpretability of the planner's behavior and its attention to relevant scene components. Unlike existing constraint learning methods that rely on simulators and are typically embedded in reinforcement learning (RL) or inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) frameworks, our method operates without simulators, making it applicable to a wider range of datasets and real-world scenarios. Experimental results on the InD and TrafficJams datasets demonstrate that incorporating driving constraints enhances model interpretability and improves closed-loop performance.</p></details> |  |

However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

Accurate forecasting requires a comprehensive understanding not only of each pedestrian's previous trajectory but also of their interaction with the surrounding environment, an important part of which are other pedestrians moving dynamically in the scene. To learn effective socially-informed representations, we propose a model that uses a reconstructor alongside a conditional variational autoencoder-based trajectory forecasting module. This module generates pseudo-trajectories, which we use as augmentations throughout the training process. To further guide the model towards social awareness, we propose a novel social loss that aids in forecasting of more stable trajectories.

To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which leverages training trajectories from small models to guide the data selection for larger models. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset (Yue et al., 2023) to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the most challenging MATH (Hendrycks et al., 2021) benchmark, improving Phi-2 (Li et al., 2023b) by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset (Johnson et al., 2016), S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform data selection using a reference model 40x smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the cost of data selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Eye Gaze Velocity Trajectories using GANs with Spectral Loss for Enhanced Fidelity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04184v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate modeling of eye gaze dynamics is essential for advancement in human-computer interaction, neurological diagnostics, and cognitive research. Traditional generative models like Markov models often fail to capture the complex temporal dependencies and distributional nuance inherent in eye gaze trajectories data. This study introduces a GAN framework employing LSTM and CNN generators and discriminators to generate high-fidelity synthetic eye gaze velocity trajectories. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of four GAN architectures: CNN-CNN, LSTM-CNN, CNN-LSTM, and LSTM-LSTM trained under two conditions: using only adversarial loss and using a weighted combination of adversarial and spectral losses. Our findings reveal that the LSTM-CNN architecture trained with this new loss function exhibits the closest alignment to the real data distribution, effectively capturing both the distribution tails and the intricate temporal dependencies. The inclusion of spectral regularization significantly enhances the GANs ability to replicate the spectral characteristics of eye gaze movements, leading to a more stable learning process and improved data fidelity. Comparative analysis with an HMM optimized to four hidden states further highlights the advantages of the LSTM-CNN GAN. Statistical metrics show that the HMM-generated data significantly diverges from the real data in terms of mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. In contrast, the LSTM-CNN model closely matches the real data across these statistics, affirming its capacity to model the complexity of eye gaze dynamics effectively. These results position the spectrally regularized LSTM-CNN GAN as a robust tool for generating synthetic eye gaze velocity data with high fidelity.</p></details> | 16 |

The satisfaction of these objectives becomes more challenging when considering time-varying dynamics and disturbances, which arise in real-world contexts. We develop methods with the potential to address these issues by applying an offline-computed safety guaranteeing controller on a physical system, to track a virtual system that evolves through a trajectory that is replanned online, accounting for constraints updated online. The first method we propose is designed for general time-varying systems over a finite horizon. Our second method overcomes the finite horizon restriction for periodic systems. We simulate our algorithms on a case study of an autonomous underwater vehicle subject to wave disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |
| **[Abstraction-based Control of Unknown Continuous-Space Models with Just Two Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03892v1)** | 2024-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite abstractions (a.k.a. symbolic models) offer an effective scheme for approximating the complex continuous-space systems with simpler models in the discrete-space domain. A crucial aspect, however, is to establish a formal relation between the original system and its symbolic model, ensuring that a discrete controller designed for the symbolic model can be effectively implemented as a hybrid controller (using an interface map) for the original system. This task becomes even more challenging when the exact mathematical model of the continuous-space system is unknown. To address this, the existing literature mainly employs scenario-based data-driven methods, which require collecting a large amount of data from the original system. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework that utilizes only two input-state trajectories collected from unknown nonlinear polynomial systems to synthesize a hybrid controller, enabling the desired behavior on the unknown system through the controller derived from its symbolic model. To accomplish this, we employ the concept of alternating simulation functions (ASFs) to quantify the closeness between the state trajectories of the unknown system and its data-driven symbolic model. By satisfying a specific rank condition on the collected data, which intuitively ensures that the unknown system is persistently excited, we directly design an ASF and its corresponding hybrid controller using finite-length data without explicitly identifying the unknown system, while providing correctness guarantees. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program, enabling a systematic approach to the design process. We illustrate the effectiveness of our data-driven approach through a case study.</p></details> |  |

However, adjusting specific elements in generated videos, such as object motion or camera movement, is often a tedious process of trial and error, e.g., involving re-generating videos with different random seeds. Recent techniques address this issue by fine-tuning a pre-trained model to follow conditioning signals, such as bounding boxes or point trajectories. Yet, this fine-tuning procedure can be computationally expensive, and it requires datasets with annotated object motion, which can be difficult to procure. In this work, we introduce SG-I2V, a framework for controllable image-to-video generation that is self-guided$\unicode{x2013}$offering zero-shot control by relying solely on the knowledge present in a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model without the need for fine-tuning or external knowledge. Our zero-shot method outperforms unsupervised baselines while significantly narrowing down the performance gap with supervised models in terms of visual quality and motion fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kmcode1.github.io/Projects/SG-I2V/</p></details> |
| **[PathletRL++: Optimizing Trajectory Pathlet Extraction and Dictionary Formation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03715v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in tracking technologies have spurred the rapid growth of large-scale trajectory data. Building a compact collection of pathlets, referred to as a trajectory pathlet dictionary, is essential for supporting mobility-related applications. Existing methods typically adopt a top-down approach, generating numerous candidate pathlets and selecting a subset, leading to high memory usage and redundant storage from overlapping pathlets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a bottom-up strategy that incrementally merges basic pathlets to build the dictionary, reducing memory requirements by up to 24,000 times compared to baseline methods. The approach begins with unit-length pathlets and iteratively merges them while optimizing utility, which is defined using newly introduced metrics of trajectory loss and representability. We develop a deep reinforcement learning framework, PathletRL, which utilizes Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to approximate the utility function, resulting in a compact and efficient pathlet dictionary. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, reducing the size of the constructed dictionary by up to 65.8%. Additionally, our results show that only half of the dictionary pathlets are needed to reconstruct 85% of the original trajectory data. Building on PathletRL, we introduce PathletRL++, which extends the original model by incorporating a richer state representation and an improved reward function to optimize decision-making during pathlet merging. These enhancements enable the agent to gain a more nuanced understanding of the environment, leading to higher-quality pathlet dictionaries. PathletRL++ achieves even greater dictionary size reduction, surpassing the performance of PathletRL, while maintaining high trajectory representability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopman Based Trajectory Optimization with Mixed Boundaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03195v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a widely used tool in the design and control of dynamical systems. Typically, not only nonlinear dynamics, but also couplings of the initial and final condition through implicit boundary constraints render the optimization problem non-convex. This paper investigates how the Koopman operator framework can be utilized to solve trajectory optimization problems in a (partially) convex fashion. While the Koopman operator has already been successfully employed in model predictive control, the challenge of addressing mixed boundary constraints within the Koopman framework has remained an open question. We first address this issue by explaining why a complete convexification of the problem is not possible. Secondly, we propose a method where we transform the trajectory optimization problem into a bilevel problem in which we are then able to convexify the high-dimensional lower-level problem. This separation yields a low-dimensional upper-level problem, which could be exploited in global optimization algorithms. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the method on two example systems: the mathematical pendulum and the compass-gait walker.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to 7th Annual Learning for Dynamics & Control Conference Research (L4DC 2025)</p></details> |

| **[Reasoning over Uncertain Text by Generative Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09614v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the challenges Large Language Models (LLMs) face when reasoning over text that includes information involving uncertainty explicitly quantified via probability values. This type of reasoning is relevant to a variety of contexts ranging from everyday conversations to medical decision-making. Despite improvements in the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs, they still exhibit significant difficulties when it comes to probabilistic reasoning. To deal with this problem, we introduce the Bayesian Linguistic Inference Dataset (BLInD), a new dataset specifically designed to test the probabilistic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. We use BLInD to find out the limitations of LLMs for tasks involving probabilistic reasoning. In addition, we present several prompting strategies that map the problem to different formal representations, including Python code, probabilistic algorithms, and probabilistic logical programming. We conclude by providing an evaluation of our methods on BLInD and an adaptation of a causal reasoning question-answering dataset. Our empirical results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for multiple LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Adapt to Other Agents In-Context?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19726v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the research community aims to build better AI assistants that are more dynamic and personalized to the diversity of humans that they interact with, there is increased interest in evaluating the theory of mind capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Indeed, several recent studies suggest that LLM theory of mind capabilities are quite impressive, approximating human-level performance. Our paper aims to rebuke this narrative and argues instead that past studies were not directly measuring agent performance, potentially leading to findings that are illusory in nature as a result. We draw a strong distinction between what we call literal theory of mind i.e. measuring the agent's ability to predict the behavior of others and functional theory of mind i.e. adapting to agents in-context based on a rational response to predictions of their behavior. We find that top performing open source LLMs may display strong capabilities in literal theory of mind, depending on how they are prompted, but seem to struggle with functional theory of mind -- even when partner policies are exceedingly simple. Our work serves to highlight the double sided nature of inductive bias in LLMs when adapting to new situations. While this bias can lead to strong performance over limited horizons, it often hinders convergence to optimal long-term behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Adaptive Reasoning in Large Language Models with Thought Rollback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19707v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been routinely used to solve various tasks using step-by-step reasoning. However, the structure of intermediate reasoning steps, or thoughts, is rigid and unidirectional, such as chains, trees, or acyclic-directed graphs. Consequently, the resulting inflexible and forward-only reasoning may not address challenging tasks and fail when the LLM frequently gives false responses, i.e., ``hallucinations''. This paper proposes a new reasoning framework, called Thought Rollback (TR), allowing LLMs to adaptively build thought structure while maintaining effective reasoning toward problem-solving under ``hallucinations''. The core mechanism of TR is rolling back thoughts, which allows LLMs to perform error analysis on thoughts, and thus roll back to any previously mistaken thought for revision. Subsequently, by including such trial-and-error in the prompt to guide the LLM, each rollback leads to one more reliable reasoning path. Therefore, starting with a simple prompt without human annotations, LLM with TR adaptively and gradually explores thoughts for a correct solution. Comprehensive experiments on mathematical problems and multi-task reasoning demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of TR in terms of problem-solving rate and interaction cost. For instance, the solving rate of GPT-4 with TR outperforms the current best by $9\%$ on the MATH dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 camera-ready version with 24 pages and 12 figures.

| **[A Large-scale Interpretable Multi-modality Benchmark for Facial Image Forgery Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19685v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image forgery localization, which centers on identifying tampered pixels within an image, has seen significant advancements. Traditional approaches often model this challenge as a variant of image segmentation, treating the binary segmentation of forged areas as the end product. We argue that the basic binary forgery mask is inadequate for explaining model predictions. It doesn't clarify why the model pinpoints certain areas and treats all forged pixels the same, making it hard to spot the most fake-looking parts. In this study, we mitigate the aforementioned limitations by generating salient region-focused interpretation for the forgery images. To support this, we craft a Multi-Modal Tramper Tracing (MMTT) dataset, comprising facial images manipulated using deepfake techniques and paired with manual, interpretable textual annotations. To harvest high-quality annotation, annotators are instructed to meticulously observe the manipulated images and articulate the typical characteristics of the forgery regions. Subsequently, we collect a dataset of 128,303 image-text pairs. Leveraging the MMTT dataset, we develop ForgeryTalker, an architecture designed for concurrent forgery localization and interpretation. ForgeryTalker first trains a forgery prompter network to identify the pivotal clues within the explanatory text. Subsequently, the region prompter is incorporated into multimodal large language model for finetuning to achieve the dual goals of localization and interpretation. Extensive experiments conducted on the MMTT dataset verify the superior performance of our proposed model. The dataset, code as well as pretrained checkpoints will be made publicly available to facilitate further research and ensure the reproducibility of our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 4 tabels</p></details> |

It examines artefacts and events particularly timestamps and metadata to detect anomalies, establish correlations, and reconstruct incident timelines. Traditional methods rely on structured artefacts, such as logs and filesystem metadata, using specialised tools for evidence identification and feature extraction. This paper introduces GenDFIR, a framework leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically Llama 3.1 8B in zero shot mode, integrated with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. Incident data is preprocessed into a structured knowledge base, enabling the RAG agent to retrieve relevant events based on user prompts. The LLM interprets this context, offering semantic enrichment. Tested on synthetic data in a controlled environment, results demonstrate GenDFIR's reliability and robustness, showcasing LLMs potential to automate timeline analysis and advance threat detection.</p></details> | 24 pages V5.3 |

Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation - Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the Constant-Q Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Current Challenges of Software Engineering in the Era of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14554v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of large language models (LLMs) in the artificial intelligence (AI) area, the field of software engineering (SE) has also witnessed a paradigm shift. These models, by leveraging the power of deep learning and massive amounts of data, have demonstrated an unprecedented capacity to understand, generate, and operate programming languages. They can assist developers in completing a broad spectrum of software development activities, encompassing software design, automated programming, and maintenance, which potentially reduces huge human efforts. Integrating LLMs within the SE landscape (LLM4SE) has become a burgeoning trend, necessitating exploring this emergent landscape's challenges and opportunities. The paper aims at revisiting the software development life cycle (SDLC) under LLMs, and highlighting challenges and opportunities of the new paradigm. The paper first summarizes the overall process of LLM4SE, and then elaborates on the current challenges based on a through discussion.

| **[MBQ: Modality-Balanced Quantization for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19509v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have enabled a variety of real-world applications. The large parameter size of VLMs brings large memory and computation overhead which poses significant challenges for deployment. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective technique to reduce the memory and computation overhead. Existing PTQ methods mainly focus on large language models (LLMs), without considering the differences across other modalities. In this paper, we discover that there is a significant difference in sensitivity between language and vision tokens in large VLMs. Therefore, treating tokens from different modalities equally, as in existing PTQ methods, may over-emphasize the insensitive modalities, leading to significant accuracy loss. To deal with the above issue, we propose a simple yet effective method, Modality-Balanced Quantization (MBQ), for large VLMs. Specifically, MBQ incorporates the different sensitivities across modalities during the calibration process to minimize the reconstruction loss for better quantization parameters. Extensive experiments show that MBQ can significantly improve task accuracy by up to 4.4% and 11.6% under W3 and W4A8 quantization for 7B to 70B VLMs, compared to SOTA baselines. Additionally, we implement a W3 GPU kernel that fuses the dequantization and GEMV operators, achieving a 1.4x speedup on LLaVA-onevision-7B on the RTX 4090.

| **[Multi-P$^2$A: A Multi-perspective Benchmark on Privacy Assessment for Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19496v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit impressive potential across various tasks but also face significant privacy risks, limiting their practical applications. Current researches on privacy assessment for LVLMs is limited in scope, with gaps in both assessment dimensions and privacy categories. To bridge this gap, we propose Multi-P$^2$A, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating the privacy preservation capabilities of LVLMs in terms of privacy awareness and leakage. Privacy awareness measures the model's ability to recognize the privacy sensitivity of input data, while privacy leakage assesses the risk of the model unintentionally disclosing privacy information in its output. We design a range of sub-tasks to thoroughly evaluate the model's privacy protection offered by LVLMs. Multi-P$^2$A covers 26 categories of personal privacy, 15 categories of trade secrets, and 18 categories of state secrets, totaling 31,962 samples. Based on Multi-P$^2$A, we evaluate the privacy preservation capabilities of 21 open-source and 2 closed-source LVLMs. Our results reveal that current LVLMs generally pose a high risk of facilitating privacy breaches, with vulnerabilities varying across personal privacy, trade secret, and state secret.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging large language models (LLMs) as intelligent agents offers a novel approach to enhancing collaboration and efficiency in IR scenarios. This paper explores the application of LLM-based multi-agent collaboration using the Backdoors & Breaches framework, a tabletop game designed for cybersecurity training. We simulate real-world IR dynamics through various team structures, including centralized, decentralized, and hybrid configurations. By analyzing agent interactions and performance across these setups, we provide insights into optimizing multi-agent collaboration for incident response. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs to enhance decision-making, improve adaptability, and streamline IR processes, paving the way for more effective and coordinated responses to cyber threats.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques for Code Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10462v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive capabilities to generate accurate code snippets given natural language intents in a zero-shot manner, i.e., without the need for specific fine-tuning. While prior studies have highlighted the advantages of fine-tuning LLMs, this process incurs high computational costs, making it impractical in resource-scarce environments, particularly for models with billions of parameters. To address these challenges, previous research explored in-context learning (ICL) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as strategies to guide the LLM generative process with task-specific prompt examples. However, ICL and RAG introduce inconveniences, such as the need for designing contextually relevant prompts and the absence of learning task-specific parameters, thereby limiting downstream task performance. In this context, we foresee parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) as a promising approach to efficiently specialize LLMs to task-specific data while maintaining reasonable resource consumption. In this paper, we deliver a comprehensive study of PEFT techniques for LLMs in the context of automated code generation. Our comprehensive investigation of PEFT techniques for LLMs reveals their superiority and potential over ICL and RAG across a diverse set of LLMs and three representative Python code generation datasets: Conala, CodeAlpacaPy, and APPS. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential for tuning larger LLMs and significant reductions in memory usage by combining PEFT with quantization. Therefore, this study opens opportunities for broader applications of PEFT in software engineering scenarios. Our code is available at https://github.com/martin-wey/peft-llm-code/.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeUltraFeedback: An LLM-as-a-Judge Dataset for Aligning Large Language Models to Coding Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09032v3)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with user-defined coding preferences is a challenging endeavour that requires a deep assessment of LLMs' outputs. Existing methods and benchmarks rely primarily on automated metrics and static analysis tools, which often fail to capture the nuances of user instructions and LLM outputs. To address this gap, we propose using the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology to evaluate the alignment of LLMs with coding preferences. Based on this approach, we present CodeUltraFeedback, a comprehensive dataset designed to facilitate the evaluation and improvement of LLM alignment. CodeUltraFeedback consists of 10,000 coding instructions, each annotated with four responses generated from a diverse pool of 14 LLMs. These responses are ranked based on five distinct coding preferences using GPT-3.5 as a judge, providing both numerical scores and detailed textual feedback. Our analysis of CodeUltraFeedback reveals that responses from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are generally preferred over those from open-weight LLMs, highlighting significant differences in alignment between closed and open-weight models. In turn, we explore the usage of CodeUltraFeedback as feedback data to fine-tune and align CodeLlama-7B-Instruct using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) with direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting aligned CodeLlama-7B-Instruct model outperforms larger LLMs in terms of alignment with coding preferences and shows improved functional correctness on the HumanEval+ benchmark compared to the original instruct model. Therefore, our contributions bridge the gap in preference tuning of LLMs for code and set the stage for further advancements in model alignment and RLAIF in automated software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Find the Intention of Instruction: Comprehensive Evaluation of Instruction Understanding for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19450v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) is their ability to interact with humans by generating appropriate responses to given instructions. This ability, known as instruction-following capability, has established a foundation for the use of LLMs across various fields and serves as a crucial metric for evaluating their performance. While numerous evaluation benchmarks have been developed, most focus solely on clear and coherent instructions. However, we have noted that LLMs can become easily distracted by instruction-formatted statements, which may lead to an oversight of their instruction comprehension skills. To address this issue, we introduce the Intention of Instruction (IoInst) benchmark. This benchmark evaluates LLMs' capacity to remain focused and understand instructions without being misled by extraneous instructions. The primary objective of this benchmark is to identify the appropriate instruction that accurately guides the generation of a given context. Our findings suggest that even recently introduced state-of-the-art models still lack instruction understanding capability. Along with the proposition of IoInst in this study, we also present broad analyses of the several strategies potentially applicable to IoInst.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Different from the traditional soft label distillation method, this method introduces a multi-layer feature alignment strategy to deeply align the intermediate features and attention mechanisms of the teacher model and the student model, maximally retaining the semantic expression ability and context modeling ability of the teacher model. In terms of method design, a multi-task loss function is constructed, including feature matching loss, attention alignment loss, and output distribution matching loss, to ensure multi-level information transfer through joint optimization. The experiments were comprehensively evaluated on the GLUE data set and various natural language processing tasks. The results show that the proposed model performs very close to the state-of-the-art GPT-4 model in terms of evaluation indicators such as perplexity, BLEU, ROUGE, and CER. At the same time, it far exceeds baseline models such as DeBERTa, XLNet, and GPT-3, showing significant performance improvements and computing efficiency advantages. Research results show that the feature alignment distillation strategy is an effective model compression method that can significantly reduce computational overhead and storage requirements while maintaining model capabilities. Future research can be further expanded in the directions of self-supervised learning, cross-modal feature alignment, and multi-task transfer learning to provide more flexible and efficient solutions for the deployment and optimization of deep learning models.</p></details> | 4 pages |

However, the computational and memory demands of LLMs, particularly during inference, pose significant challenges when scaling them to real-world, long-context, and real-time applications. Key-Value (KV) cache management has emerged as a critical optimization technique for accelerating LLM inference by reducing redundant computations and improving memory utilization. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of KV cache management strategies for LLM acceleration, categorizing them into token-level, model-level, and system-level optimizations. Token-level strategies include KV cache selection, budget allocation, merging, quantization, and low-rank decomposition, while model-level optimizations focus on architectural innovations and attention mechanisms to enhance KV reuse. System-level approaches address memory management, scheduling, and hardware-aware designs to improve efficiency across diverse computing environments. Additionally, the survey provides an overview of both text and multimodal datasets and benchmarks used to evaluate these strategies. By presenting detailed taxonomies and comparative analyses, this work aims to offer useful insights for researchers and practitioners to support the development of efficient and scalable KV cache management techniques, contributing to the practical deployment of LLMs in real-world applications.

| **[A Matrix Logic Approach to Efficient Frequent Itemset Discovery in Large Data Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19420v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a frequent itemset mining algorithm based on the Boolean matrix method, aiming to solve the storage and computational bottlenecks of traditional frequent pattern mining algorithms in high-dimensional and large-scale transaction databases. By representing the itemsets in the transaction database as Boolean matrices, the algorithm uses Boolean logic operations such as AND and OR to efficiently calculate the support of the itemsets, avoiding the generation and storage of a large number of candidates itemsets in traditional algorithms. The algorithm recursively mines frequent itemsets through matrix operations and can flexibly adapt to different data scales and support thresholds. In the experiment, the public Groceries dataset was selected, and the running efficiency test and frequent itemset mining effect test were designed to evaluate the algorithm's performance indicators such as running time, memory usage, and number of frequent itemsets under different transaction numbers and support thresholds. The experimental results show that the algorithm can efficiently mine a large number of frequent itemsets when the support threshold is low, and focus on strong association rules with high support when the threshold is high. In addition, the changing trends of running time and memory usage show that the Boolean matrix method can still maintain good running efficiency when the number of transactions increases significantly and has high scalability and robustness. Future research can improve memory optimization and matrix block operations, and combine distributed computing and deep learning models to further enhance the algorithm's applicability and real-time processing capabilities in ultra-large-scale data environments. The algorithm has broad application potential and development prospects in the fields of market analysis, recommendation systems, and network security.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we conduct a detailed statistical analysis of active Starlink users and PoPs. Finally, we summarize the IPv6 address assignment strategy adopted by the Starlink network.

In this paper, MLLMs are utilized to solve joint semantic scene understanding and risk localization tasks, while only relying on front-view images. In the proposed MLLM-SUL framework, a dual-branch visual encoder is first designed to extract features from two resolutions, and rich visual information is conducive to the language model describing risk objects of different sizes accurately. Then for the language generation, LLaMA model is fine-tuned to predict scene descriptions, containing the type of driving scenario, actions of risk objects, and driving intentions and suggestions of ego-vehicle. Ultimately, a transformer-based network incorporating a regression token is trained to locate the risk objects. Extensive experiments on the existing DRAMA-ROLISP dataset and the extended DRAMA-SRIS dataset demonstrate that our method is efficient, surpassing many state-of-the-art image-based and video-based methods. Specifically, our method achieves 80.1% BLEU-1 score and 298.5% CIDEr score in the scene understanding task, and 59.6% accuracy in the localization task.

| **[Towards General Industrial Intelligence: A Survey of Continual Large Models in Industrial IoT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01207v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial AI is transitioning from traditional deep learning models to large-scale transformer-based architectures, with the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) playing a pivotal role. IIoT evolves from a simple data pipeline to an intelligent infrastructure, enabling and enhancing these advanced AI systems. This survey explores the integration of IIoT with large models (LMs) and their potential applications in industrial environments. We focus on four primary types of industrial LMs: language-based, vision-based, time-series, and multimodal models. The lifecycle of LMs is segmented into four critical phases: data foundation, model training, model connectivity, and continuous evolution. First, we analyze how IIoT provides abundant and diverse data resources, supporting the training and fine-tuning of LMs. Second, we discuss how IIoT offers an efficient training infrastructure in low-latency and bandwidth-optimized environments. Third, we highlight the deployment advantages of LMs within IIoT, emphasizing IIoT's role as a connectivity nexus fostering emergent intelligence through modular design, dynamic routing, and model merging to enhance system scalability and adaptability. Finally, we demonstrate how IIoT supports continual learning mechanisms, enabling LMs to adapt to dynamic industrial conditions and ensure long-term effectiveness. This paper underscores IIoT's critical role in the evolution of industrial intelligence with large models, offering a theoretical framework and actionable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[PyraNet: A Large Scale Hierarchical Verilog Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06947v2)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in leveraging Large Language Models for Verilog code generation. However, the current quality of the generated Verilog code remains suboptimal. This is largely due to the absence of well-defined, well-organized datasets with high-quality samples, as well as a lack of innovative fine-tuning methods and models specifically trained on Verilog. In this paper, we introduce a novel open-source dataset and a corresponding fine-tuning technique, which utilizes a multi-layered structure that we refer to as PyraNet. Our experiments demonstrate that employing the proposed dataset and fine-tuning approach leads to a more accurate fine-tuned model, producing syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code. The evaluation results show improvements by up-to $32.6\%$ in comparison to the CodeLlama-7B baseline model and up-to $16.7\%$ in comparison to the state-of-the-art models using VerilogEval evaluation platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Engorgio Prompt Makes Large Language Model Babble on](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19394v1)** | 2024-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-regressive large language models (LLMs) have yielded impressive performance in many real-world tasks. However, the new paradigm of these LLMs also exposes novel threats. In this paper, we explore their vulnerability to inference cost attacks, where a malicious user crafts Engorgio prompts to intentionally increase the computation cost and latency of the inference process. We design Engorgio, a novel methodology, to efficiently generate adversarial Engorgio prompts to affect the target LLM's service availability. Engorgio has the following two technical contributions. (1) We employ a parameterized distribution to track LLMs' prediction trajectory. (2) Targeting the auto-regressive nature of LLMs' inference process, we propose novel loss functions to stably suppress the appearance of the <EOS> token, whose occurrence will interrupt the LLM's generation process. We conduct extensive experiments on 13 open-sourced LLMs with parameters ranging from 125M to 30B. The results show that Engorgio prompts can successfully induce LLMs to generate abnormally long outputs (i.e., roughly 2-13$\times$ longer to reach 90%+ of the output length limit) in a white-box scenario and our real-world experiment demonstrates Engergio's threat to LLM service with limited computing resources. The code is accessible at https://github.com/jianshuod/Engorgio-prompt.</p></details> |  |
| **[A blueprint for large-scale quantum-network deployments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01069v2)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum Communications is a field that promises advances in cryptography, quantum computing and clock synchronisation, among other potential applications. However, communication based on quantum phenomena requires an extreme level of isolation from external disturbances, making the transmission of quantum signals together with classical ones difficult. A range of techniques has been tested to introduce quantum communications in already deployed optical networks which also carry legacy traffic. This comes with challenges, not only at the physical layer but also at the operations and management layer. To achieve a broad acceptance among network operators, the joint management and operation of quantum and classical resources, compliance with standards, and quality and legal assurance need to be addressed. This article presents a detailed account of solutions to the above issues, deployed and evaluated in the MadQCI (Madrid Quantum Communication Infrastructure) testbed. This network is designed to integrate quantum communications in the telecommunications ecosystem by installing quantum-key-distribution modules from multiple providers in production nodes of two different operators. The modules were connected through an optical-switched network with more than 130 km of deployed optical fibre. The tests were done in compliance with strict service level agreements that protected the legacy traffic of the pre-existing classical network. The goal was to achieve full quantum-classical compatibility at all levels, while limiting the modifications of optical transport and encryption and complying with as many standards as possible. This effort was intended to serve as a blueprint, which can be used as the foundation of large-scale quantum network deployments. To demonstrate the capabilities of MadQCI, end-to-end encryption services were deployed and a variety of use-cases were showcased.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Large Language Models for Market Research: A Data-augmentation Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19363v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed artificial intelligence by excelling in complex natural language processing tasks. Their ability to generate human-like text has opened new possibilities for market research, particularly in conjoint analysis, where understanding consumer preferences is essential but often resource-intensive. Traditional survey-based methods face limitations in scalability and cost, making LLM-generated data a promising alternative. However, while LLMs have the potential to simulate real consumer behavior, recent studies highlight a significant gap between LLM-generated and human data, with biases introduced when substituting between the two. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a novel statistical data augmentation approach that efficiently integrates LLM-generated data with real data in conjoint analysis. Our method leverages transfer learning principles to debias the LLM-generated data using a small amount of human data. This results in statistically robust estimators with consistent and asymptotically normal properties, in contrast to naive approaches that simply substitute human data with LLM-generated data, which can exacerbate bias. We validate our framework through an empirical study on COVID-19 vaccine preferences, demonstrating its superior ability to reduce estimation error and save data and costs by 24.9\% to 79.8\%. In contrast, naive approaches fail to save data due to the inherent biases in LLM-generated data compared to human data. Another empirical study on sports car choices validates the robustness of our results. Our findings suggest that while LLM-generated data is not a direct substitute for human responses, it can serve as a valuable complement when used within a robust statistical framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Skill Adaptation for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19361v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Dynamic Skill Adaptation (DSA), an adaptive and dynamic framework to adapt novel and complex skills to Large Language Models (LLMs). Compared with previous work which learns from human-curated and static data in random orders, we propose to first automatically generate and organize the training data by mimicking the learning pathways of human and then dynamically tailor the training data based on the training dynamics. Specifically, inspired by the learning structures and teaching strategies in the human education system, we first construct a skill graph by decomposing complex skills into sub-skills and arranging them based on their dependencies in human syllables. For every skill, we utilize LLMs to generate both textbook-like data which contains detailed descriptions of skills for pre-training and exercise-like data which targets at explicitly utilizing the skills to solve problems for instruction-tuning. Furthermore, during the instruction-tuning, we dynamically update the training data which down-weight easy-to-learn examples, generate more complex examples, and filter out data with errors. Experiments on large language models such as LLAMA and Mistral demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods in adapting math reasoning skills and social study skills.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-Supervised Learning from Small Annotated Data and Large Unlabeled Data for Fine-grained PICO Entity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19346v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Extracting PICO elements -- Participants, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcomes -- from clinical trial literature is essential for clinical evidence retrieval, appraisal, and synthesis. Existing approaches do not distinguish the attributes of PICO entities. This study aims to develop a named entity recognition (NER) model to extract PICO entities with fine granularities. Materials and Methods: Using a corpus of 2,511 abstracts with PICO mentions from 4 public datasets, we developed a semi-supervised method to facilitate the training of a NER model, FinePICO, by combining limited annotated data of PICO entities and abundant unlabeled data. For evaluation, we divided the entire dataset into two subsets: a smaller group with annotations and a larger group without annotations. We then established the theoretical lower and upper performance bounds based on the performance of supervised learning models trained solely on the small, annotated subset and on the entire set with complete annotations, respectively. Finally, we evaluated FinePICO on both the smaller annotated subset and the larger, initially unannotated subset. We measured the performance of FinePICO using precision, recall, and F1. Results: Our method achieved precision/recall/F1 of 0.567/0.636/0.60, respectively, using a small set of annotated samples, outperforming the baseline model (F1: 0.437) by more than 16\%. The model demonstrates generalizability to a different PICO framework and to another corpus, which consistently outperforms the benchmark in diverse experimental settings (p-value \textless0.001). Conclusion: This study contributes a generalizable and effective semi-supervised approach to named entity recognition leveraging large unlabeled data together with small, annotated data. It also initially supports fine-grained PICO extraction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Holistic Landscape of Situated Theory of Mind in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19619v2)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have generated considerable interest and debate regarding their potential emergence of Theory of Mind (ToM). Several recent inquiries reveal a lack of robust ToM in these models and pose a pressing demand to develop new benchmarks, as current ones primarily focus on different aspects of ToM and are prone to shortcuts and data leakage. In this position paper, we seek to answer two road-blocking questions: (1) How can we taxonomize a holistic landscape of machine ToM? (2) What is a more effective evaluation protocol for machine ToM? Following psychological studies, we taxonomize machine ToM into 7 mental state categories and delineate existing benchmarks to identify under-explored aspects of ToM. We argue for a holistic and situated evaluation of ToM to break ToM into individual components and treat LLMs as an agent who is physically situated in environments and socially situated in interactions with humans. Such situated evaluation provides a more comprehensive assessment of mental states and potentially mitigates the risk of shortcuts and data leakage. We further present a pilot study in a grid world setup as a proof of concept. We hope this position paper can facilitate future research to integrate ToM with LLMs and offer an intuitive means for researchers to better position their work in the landscape of ToM.

While some works have demonstrated the capability of LVLMs to generate segmentation masks that align phrases with natural language descriptions in a single image, they struggle with segmentation-grounded comparisons across multiple images, particularly at finer granularities such as object parts. In this paper, we introduce the new task of part-focused semantic co-segmentation, which seeks to identify and segment common and unique objects and parts across images. To address this task, we present CALICO, the first LVLM that can segment and reason over multiple masks across images, enabling object comparison based on their constituent parts. CALICO features two proposed components, a novel Correspondence Extraction Module, which captures semantic-rich information to identify part-level correspondences between objects, and a Correspondence Adaptation Module, which embeds this information into the LVLM to facilitate multi-image understanding in a parameter-efficient manner. To support training and evaluation, we curate MixedParts, a comprehensive multi-image segmentation dataset containing $\sim$2.4M samples across $\sim$44K images with diverse object and part categories. Experimental results show CALICO, finetuned on only 0.3% of its architecture, achieves robust performance in part-focused semantic co-segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://plan-lab.github.io/calico</p></details> |
| **[Task Preference Optimization: Improving Multimodal Large Language Models with Vision Task Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19326v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle with fine-grained or precise understanding of visuals though they give comprehensive perception and reasoning in a spectrum of vision applications. Recent studies either develop tool-using or unify specific visual tasks into the autoregressive framework, often at the expense of overall multimodal performance. To address this issue and enhance MLLMs with visual tasks in a scalable fashion, we propose Task Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel method that utilizes differentiable task preferences derived from typical fine-grained visual tasks. TPO introduces learnable task tokens that establish connections between multiple task-specific heads and the MLLM. By leveraging rich visual labels during training, TPO significantly enhances the MLLM's multimodal capabilities and task-specific performance. Through multi-task co-training within TPO, we observe synergistic benefits that elevate individual task performance beyond what is achievable through single-task training methodologies. Our instantiation of this approach with VideoChat and LLaVA demonstrates an overall 14.6% improvement in multimodal performance compared to baseline models. Additionally, MLLM-TPO demonstrates robust zero-shot capabilities across various tasks, performing comparably to state-of-the-art supervised models. The code will be released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/TPO</p></details> | technical report |

In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach called Social Robot Planner (SRLM), which integrates Large Language Models (LLM) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to navigate through human-filled public spaces and provide multiple social services. SRLM infers global planning from human-in-loop commands in real-time, and encodes social information into a LLM-based large navigation model (LNM) for low-level motion execution. Moreover, a DRL-based planner is designed to maintain benchmarking performance, which is blended with LNM by a large feedback model (LFM) to address the instability of current text and LLM-driven LNM. Finally, SRLM demonstrates outstanding performance in extensive experiments. More details about this work are available at: https://sites.google.com/view/navi-srlm</p></details> |  |
| **[Sentiment trading with large language models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19245v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis of U.S. financial news and their potential in predicting stock market returns. We analyze a dataset comprising 965,375 news articles that span from January 1, 2010, to June 30, 2023; we focus on the performance of various LLMs, including BERT, OPT, FINBERT, and the traditional Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, which has been a dominant methodology in the finance literature. The study documents a significant association between LLM scores and subsequent daily stock returns. Specifically, OPT, which is a GPT-3 based LLM, shows the highest accuracy in sentiment prediction with an accuracy of 74.4%, slightly ahead of BERT (72.5%) and FINBERT (72.2%). In contrast, the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model demonstrates considerably lower effectiveness with only 50.1% accuracy. Regression analyses highlight a robust positive impact of OPT model scores on next-day stock returns, with coefficients of 0.274 and 0.254 in different model specifications. BERT and FINBERT also exhibit predictive relevance, though to a lesser extent. Notably, we do not observe a significant relationship between the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model scores and stock returns, challenging the efficacy of this traditional method in the current financial context. In portfolio performance, the long-short OPT strategy excels with a Sharpe ratio of 3.05, compared to 2.11 for BERT and 2.07 for FINBERT long-short strategies. Strategies based on the Loughran-McDonald dictionary yield the lowest Sharpe ratio of 1.23. Our findings emphasize the superior performance of advanced LLMs, especially OPT, in financial market prediction and portfolio management, marking a significant shift in the landscape of financial analysis tools with implications to financial regulation and policy analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Meet Graph Neural Networks: A Perspective of Graph Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19211v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph mining is an important area in data mining and machine learning that involves extracting valuable information from graph-structured data. In recent years, significant progress has been made in this field through the development of graph neural networks (GNNs). However, GNNs are still deficient in generalizing to diverse graph data. Aiming to this issue, Large Language Models (LLMs) could provide new solutions for graph mining tasks with their superior semantic understanding. In this review, we systematically review the combination and application techniques of LLMs and GNNs and present a novel taxonomy for research in this interdisciplinary field, which involves three main categories: GNN-driving-LLM, LLM-driving-GNN, and GNN-LLM-co-driving. Within this framework, we reveal the capabilities of LLMs in enhancing graph feature extraction as well as improving the effectiveness of downstream tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and community detection. Although LLMs have demonstrated their great potential in handling graph-structured data, their high computational requirements and complexity remain challenges. Future research needs to continue to explore how to efficiently fuse LLMs and GNNs to achieve more powerful graph learning and reasoning capabilities and provide new impetus for the development of graph mining techniques.</p></details> |  |

However, exploring and exploiting the extensive knowledge of these models to comprehend multi-omics biology remains underexplored. To fill this research gap, we first introduce Biology-Instructions, the first large-scale multi-omics biological sequences-related instruction-tuning dataset including DNA, RNA, proteins, and multi-molecules, designed to bridge the gap between large language models (LLMs) and complex biological sequences-related tasks. This dataset can enhance the versatility of LLMs by integrating diverse biological sequenced-based prediction tasks with advanced reasoning capabilities, while maintaining conversational fluency. Additionally, we reveal significant performance limitations in even state-of-the-art LLMs on biological sequence-related multi-omics tasks without specialized pre-training and instruction-tuning. We further develop a strong baseline called ChatMultiOmics with a novel three-stage training pipeline, demonstrating the powerful ability to understand biology by using Biology-Instructions. Biology-Instructions and ChatMultiOmics are publicly available and crucial resources for enabling more effective integration of LLMs with multi-omics sequence analysis.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to intuitively and effectively optimize RL reward functions in a human-centric way. We developed a framework where instructions and dynamic environment descriptions are input into the LLM. The LLM then utilizes this information to assist in generating rewards, thereby steering the behavior of RL agents towards patterns that more closely resemble human driving. The experimental results demonstrate that this approach not only makes RL agents more anthropomorphic but also achieves better performance. Additionally, various strategies for reward-proxy and reward-shaping are investigated, revealing the significant impact of prompt design on shaping an AD vehicle's behavior. These findings offer a promising direction for the development of more advanced, human-like automated driving systems.

Recent works utilize Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate enriched action step description texts to guide action step decoding. Although LLMs are introduced, these methods decode the action steps into a closed-set of one-hot vectors, limiting the model's capability of generalizing to new steps or tasks. Additionally, fixed action step descriptions based on world-level commonsense may contain noise in specific instances of visual states. In this paper, we propose PlanLLM, a cross-modal joint learning framework with LLMs for video procedure planning. We propose an LLM-Enhanced Planning module which fully uses the generalization ability of LLMs to produce free-form planning output and to enhance action step decoding. We also propose Mutual Information Maximization module to connect world-level commonsense of step descriptions and sample-specific information of visual states, enabling LLMs to employ the reasoning ability to generate step sequences. With the assistance of LLMs, our method can both closed-set and open vocabulary procedure planning tasks. Our PlanLLM achieves superior performance on three benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> | accepted to AAAI2025 |

In this paper, we introduce Falcon, an innovative semi-autoregressive speculative decoding framework fashioned to augment both the drafter's parallelism and output quality. Falcon incorporates the Coupled Sequential Glancing Distillation technique, which fortifies inter-token dependencies within the same block, leading to increased speculation accuracy. We offer a comprehensive theoretical analysis to illuminate the underlying mechanisms. Additionally, we introduce a Custom-Designed Decoding Tree, which permits the drafter to generate multiple tokens in a single forward pass and accommodates multiple forward passes as needed, thereby boosting the number of drafted tokens and significantly improving the overall acceptance rate. Comprehensive evaluations on benchmark datasets such as MT-Bench, HumanEval, and GSM8K demonstrate Falcon's superior acceleration capabilities. The framework achieves a lossless speedup ratio ranging from 2.91x to 3.51x when tested on the Vicuna and LLaMA2-Chat model series. These results outstrip existing speculative decoding methods for LLMs, including Eagle, Medusa, Lookahead, SPS, and PLD, while maintaining a compact drafter architecture equivalent to merely two Transformer layers.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 Accepted |
| **[FFCG: Effective and Fast Family Column Generation for Solving Large-Scale Linear Program](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19066v1)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Column Generation (CG) is an effective and iterative algorithm to solve large-scale linear programs (LP). During each CG iteration, new columns are added to improve the solution of the LP. Typically, CG greedily selects one column with the most negative reduced cost, which can be improved by adding more columns at once. However, selecting all columns with negative reduced costs would lead to the addition of redundant columns that do not improve the objective value. Therefore, selecting the appropriate columns to add is still an open problem and previous machine-learning-based approaches for CG only add a constant quantity of columns per iteration due to the state-space explosion problem. To address this, we propose Fast Family Column Generation (FFCG) -- a novel reinforcement-learning-based CG that selects a variable number of columns as needed in an iteration. Specifically, we formulate the column selection problem in CG as an MDP and design a reward metric that balances both the convergence speed and the number of redundant columns. In our experiments, FFCG converges faster on the common benchmarks and reduces the number of CG iterations by 77.1% for Cutting Stock Problem (CSP) and 84.8% for Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW), and a 71.4% reduction in computing time for CSP and 84.0% for VRPTW on average compared to several state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a lack of comprehensive and publicly accessible benchmarks to evaluate the performance of LLMs on cybersecurity tasks. To address this gap, we introduce CS-Eval, a publicly accessible, comprehensive and bilingual LLM benchmark specifically designed for cybersecurity. CS-Eval synthesizes the research hotspots from academia and practical applications from industry, curating a diverse set of high-quality questions across 42 categories within cybersecurity, systematically organized into three cognitive levels: knowledge, ability, and application. Through an extensive evaluation of a wide range of LLMs using CS-Eval, we have uncovered valuable insights. For instance, while GPT-4 generally excels overall, other models may outperform it in certain specific subcategories. Additionally, by conducting evaluations over several months, we observed significant improvements in many LLMs' abilities to solve cybersecurity tasks. The benchmarks are now publicly available at https://github.com/CS-EVAL/CS-Eval.</p></details> |  |

Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from either insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or large inference time overhead. To address these limitations, we propose PrivacyRestore, a plug-and-play method to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. The server first trains restoration vectors for each privacy span and then release to clients. Privacy span is defined as a contiguous sequence of tokens within a text that contain private information. The client then aggregate restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a single meta restoration vector which is later sent to the server side along with the input without privacy spans.The private information is restored via activation steering during inference. Furthermore, we prove that PrivacyRestore inherently prevents the linear growth of the privacy budget.We create three datasets, covering medical and legal domains, to evaluate the effectiveness of privacy preserving methods. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore effectively protects private information and maintain acceptable levels of performance and inference overhead.</p></details> |  |

However, state-of-the-art KVCache centric approaches handleload spikes by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache,which faces an essential tradeoff between the performance ofongoing vs. incoming requests and thus still severely violatesSLO.This paper makes a key observation such that model param-eters are independent of the requests and are replicated acrossGPUs, and thus proposes a parameter-centric approach byselectively dropping replicated parameters to leave preciousmemory for requests. However, LLM requires KVCache tobe saved in bound with model parameters and thus droppingparameters can cause either huge computation waste or longnetwork delay, affecting all ongoing requests. Based on the ob-servation that attention operators can be decoupled from otheroperators, this paper further proposes a novel remote attentionmechanism through pipeline parallelism so as to serve up-coming requests with the additional memory borrowed fromparameters on remote GPUs. This paper further addresses sev-eral other challenges including lively exchanging KVCachewith incomplete parameters, generating an appropriate planthat balances memory requirements with cooperative exe-cution overhead, and seamlessly restoring parameters whenthe throttling has gone. Evaluations show thatKUNSERVEreduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 27.3x compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However, this approach overlooks the wealth of semantic information embedded within textual descriptions of items, leading to suboptimal performance and poor generalizations. Leveraging the capability of large language models to comprehend and reason about textual content presents a promising avenue for advancing recommendation systems. To achieve this, we propose an Llm-driven knowlEdge Adaptive RecommeNdation (LEARN) framework that synergizes open-world knowledge with collaborative knowledge. We address computational complexity concerns by utilizing pretrained LLMs as item encoders and freezing LLM parameters to avoid catastrophic forgetting and preserve open-world knowledge. To bridge the gap between the open-world and collaborative domains, we design a twin-tower structure supervised by the recommendation task and tailored for practical industrial application. Through experiments on the real large-scale industrial dataset and online A/B tests, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in industry application.

| **[Clustering Algorithms and RAG Enhancing Semi-Supervised Text Classification with Large LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06175v3)** | 2024-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a Clustering, Labeling, then Augmenting framework that significantly enhances performance in Semi-Supervised Text Classification (SSTC) tasks, effectively addressing the challenge of vast datasets with limited labeled examples. Unlike traditional SSTC approaches that rely on a predefined small set of labeled data to generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data, this framework innovatively employs clustering to select representative "landmarks" for labeling. These landmarks subsequently act as intermediaries in an ensemble of augmentation techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Large Language Model (LLMs)-based rewriting, and synonym substitution, to generate synthetic labeled data without making pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data. Empirical results show that even in complex text document classification scenarios involving over 100 categories, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracies of 95.41% on the Reuters dataset and 82.43% on the Web of Science dataset. Our approach significantly reduces the reliance on human labeling efforts and the associated expenses, while simultaneously ensuring high data quality and minimizing privacy risks. The finetuning results further show the efficiency of fine-tuning LLMs for text classification tasks, highlighting a robust solution for leveraging limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

As large language models (LLMs) and their associated technologies advance, particularly in the realms of prompt engineering and agent engineering, network optimization will witness a revolutionary approach. This approach entails the strategic use of well-crafted prompts to infuse human experience and knowledge into these sophisticated LLMs, and the deployment of autonomous agents as a communication bridge to seamlessly connect the machine language based LLMs with human users using natural language. Furthermore, our proposed framework incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to enhance the system's ability to acquire domain-specific knowledge and generate solutions, thereby enabling the customization and optimization of the BSS process. This integration represents the future paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) as a service and AI for more ease. This research first develops a novel LLM-empowered BSS optimization framework, and heuristically proposes three different potential implementations: the strategies based on Prompt-optimized LLM (PoL), LLM-empowered autonomous BSS agent (LaBa), and Cooperative multiple LLM-based autonomous BSS agents (CLaBa). Through evaluation on real-world data, the experiments demonstrate that prompt-assisted LLMs and LLM-based agents can generate more efficient and reliable network deployments, noticeably enhancing the efficiency of BSS optimization and reducing trivial manual participation.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmarking Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18989v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential in automating software engineering tasks, particularly in code generation. However, current evaluation benchmarks, which primarily focus on accuracy, fall short in assessing the quality of the code generated by these models, specifically their tendency to produce code smells. To address this limitation, we introduce CodeSmellEval, a benchmark designed to evaluate the propensity of LLMs for generating code smells. Our benchmark includes a novel metric: Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), and a curated dataset of method-level code smells: CodeSmellData. To demonstrate the use of CodeSmellEval, we conducted a case study with two state-of-the-art LLMs, CodeLlama and Mistral. The results reveal that both models tend to generate code smells, such as simplifiable-condition and consider-merging-isinstance. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our benchmark in evaluating LLMs, providing valuable insights into their reliability and their propensity to introduce code smells in code generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17919v4)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freezes most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while achieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

This paper introduces MedHallBench, a comprehensive benchmark framework for evaluating and mitigating hallucinations in MLLMs. Our methodology integrates expert-validated medical case scenarios with established medical databases to create a robust evaluation dataset. The framework employs a sophisticated measurement system that combines automated ACHMI (Automatic Caption Hallucination Measurement in Medical Imaging) scoring with rigorous clinical expert evaluations and utilizes reinforcement learning methods to achieve automatic annotation. Through an optimized reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) training pipeline specifically designed for medical applications, MedHallBench enables thorough evaluation of MLLMs across diverse clinical contexts while maintaining stringent accuracy standards. We conducted comparative experiments involving various models, utilizing the benchmark to establish a baseline for widely adopted large language models (LLMs). Our findings indicate that ACHMI provides a more nuanced understanding of the effects of hallucinations compared to traditional metrics, thereby highlighting its advantages in hallucination assessment. This research establishes a foundational framework for enhancing MLLMs' reliability in healthcare settings and presents actionable strategies for addressing the critical challenge of AI hallucinations in medical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published to AAAI-25 Bridge Program</p></details> |

| **[ReverseNER: A Self-Generated Example-Driven Framework for Zero-Shot Named Entity Recognition with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00533v4)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents ReverseNER, a method aimed at overcoming the limitation of large language models (LLMs) in zero-shot named entity recognition (NER) tasks, arising from their reliance on pre-provided demonstrations. ReverseNER tackles this challenge by constructing a reliable example library composed of dozens of entity-labeled sentences, generated through the reverse process of NER. Specifically, while conventional NER methods label entities in a sentence, ReverseNER features reversing the process by using an LLM to generate entities from their definitions and subsequently expand them into full sentences. During the entity expansion process, the LLM is guided to generate sentences by replicating the structures of a set of specific \textsl{feature sentences}, extracted from the task sentences by clustering. This expansion process produces dozens of entity-labeled task-relevant sentences. After constructing the example library, the method selects several semantically similar entity-labeled examples for each task sentence as references to facilitate the LLM's entity recognition. We also propose an entity-level self-consistency scoring mechanism to improve NER performance with LLMs. Experiments show that ReverseNER significantly outperforms other zero-shot NER methods with LLMs, marking a notable improvement in NER for domains without labeled data, while declining computational resource consumption.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we present an automated review generation method based on Large Language Models (LLMs), aimed at overcoming efficiency bottlenecks in literature processing and reducing cognitive load. Our statistically validated evaluation framework demonstrates that the generated reviews match or exceed manual quality, offering broad applicability across research fields due to minimal domain knowledge requirements. In a case study on propane dehydrogenation (PDH) catalysts, our method swiftly analyzed 343 articles, averaging seconds per article per LLM account, producing comprehensive reviews spanning 35 topics. Extended analysis of 1041 articles provided deep insights into catalysts' composition, structure, and performance. Recognizing LLMs' hallucinations, we implemented a multi-layered quality control strategy, effectively mitigating risks and ensuring reliability, as quantitatively demonstrated through manual verification. Expert verification confirms the accuracy and citation integrity of generated reviews, demonstrating LLM hallucination risks reduced to below 0.5\% with over 95\% confidence. Released Windows application enables one-click review generation, aiding researchers in tracking advancements and recommending literature.

| **[Large Language Model Simulator for Cold-Start Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09176v2)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommending cold items remains a significant challenge in billion-scale online recommendation systems. While warm items benefit from historical user behaviors, cold items rely solely on content features, limiting their recommendation performance and impacting user experience and revenue. Current models generate synthetic behavioral embeddings from content features but fail to address the core issue: the absence of historical behavior data. To tackle this, we introduce the LLM Simulator framework, which leverages large language models to simulate user interactions for cold items, fundamentally addressing the cold-start problem. However, simply using LLM to traverse all users can introduce significant complexity in billion-scale systems. To manage the computational complexity, we propose a coupled funnel ColdLLM framework for online recommendation. ColdLLM efficiently reduces the number of candidate users from billions to hundreds using a trained coupled filter, allowing the LLM to operate efficiently and effectively on the filtered set. Extensive experiments show that ColdLLM significantly surpasses baselines in cold-start recommendations, including Recall and NDCG metrics. A two-week A/B test also validates that ColdLLM can effectively increase the cold-start period GMV.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, accepted by WSDM 2025</p></details> |

This paper explores the potential of LLMs to drive the discovery of symbolic solutions within scientific and engineering disciplines, where such solutions are crucial for advancing theoretical and practical applications. We propose a novel framework that utilizes LLMs in an evolutionary search methodology, augmented by a dynamic knowledge library that integrates and refines insights in an \textit{open-ended manner}. This approach aims to tackle the dual challenges of efficiently navigating complex symbolic representation spaces and leveraging both existing and newly generated knowledge to foster open-ended innovation. By enabling LLMs to interact with and expand upon a knowledge library, we facilitate the continuous generation of novel solutions in diverse forms such as language, code, and mathematical expressions. Our experimental results demonstrate that this method not only enhances the efficiency of searching for symbolic solutions but also supports the ongoing discovery process, akin to human scientific endeavors. This study represents a first effort in conceptualizing the search for symbolic solutions as a lifelong, iterative process, marking a significant step towards harnessing AI in the perpetual pursuit of scientific and engineering breakthroughs.

By employing progressive semantic decoding with two popular generative models, language models (LMs) and Flow Matching, CosyVoice demonstrated high prosody naturalness, content consistency, and speaker similarity in speech in-context learning. Recently, significant progress has been made in multi-modal large language models (LLMs), where the response latency and real-time factor of speech synthesis play a crucial role in the interactive experience. Therefore, in this report, we present an improved streaming speech synthesis model, CosyVoice 2, which incorporates comprehensive and systematic optimizations. Specifically, we introduce finite-scalar quantization to improve the codebook utilization of speech tokens. For the text-speech LM, we streamline the model architecture to allow direct use of a pre-trained LLM as the backbone. In addition, we develop a chunk-aware causal flow matching model to support various synthesis scenarios, enabling both streaming and non-streaming synthesis within a single model. By training on a large-scale multilingual dataset, CosyVoice 2 achieves human-parity naturalness, minimal response latency, and virtually lossless synthesis quality in the streaming mode.

When interacting with a user, an embodied intelligent agent should be capable of responding to various queries about the scene formulated in natural language. Large Language Models (LLMs) are beneficial solutions for user-robot interaction due to their natural language understanding and reasoning abilities. Recent methods for creating learnable representations of 3D scenes have demonstrated the potential to improve the quality of LLMs responses by adapting to the 3D world. However, the existing methods do not explicitly utilize information about the semantic relationships between objects, limiting themselves to information about their coordinates. In this work, we propose a method 3DGraphLLM for constructing a learnable representation of a 3D scene graph. The learnable representation is used as input for LLMs to perform 3D vision-language tasks. In our experiments on popular ScanRefer, RIORefer, Multi3DRefer, ScanQA, Sqa3D, and Scan2cap datasets, we demonstrate the advantage of this approach over baseline methods that do not use information about the semantic relationships between objects. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/CognitiveAISystems/3DGraphLLM.</p></details> |  |

Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by integrating outside data sources. While previous RAG systems used pre-assembled, fixed databases with limited flexibility, we have developed Radiology RAG (RadioRAG), an end-to-end framework that retrieves data from authoritative radiologic online sources in real-time. We evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of various LLMs when answering radiology-specific questions with and without access to additional online information via RAG. Using 80 questions from the RSNA Case Collection across radiologic subspecialties and 24 additional expert-curated questions with reference standard answers, LLMs (GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, Mistral-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, and Llama3 [8B and 70B]) were prompted with and without RadioRAG in a zero-shot inference scenario RadioRAG retrieved context-specific information from www.radiopaedia.org in real-time. Accuracy was investigated. Statistical analyses were performed using bootstrapping. The results were further compared with human performance. RadioRAG improved diagnostic accuracy across most LLMs, with relative accuracy increases ranging up to 54% for different LLMs. It matched or exceeded non-RAG models and the human radiologist in question answering across radiologic subspecialties, particularly in breast imaging and emergency radiology. However, the degree of improvement varied among models; GPT-3.5-turbo and Mixtral-8x7B-instruct-v0.1 saw notable gains, while Mistral-7B-instruct-v0.2 showed no improvement, highlighting variability in RadioRAG's effectiveness. LLMs benefit when provided access to domain-specific data beyond their training data. For radiology, RadioRAG establishes a robust framework that substantially improves diagnostic accuracy and factuality in radiological question answering.</p></details> |  |

However, such automatically generated tests have no meaningful test and variable names, making them hard to understand and interpret by developers. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) can generate highly readable test cases, but they are not able to match the effectiveness of search-based generators, in terms of achieved code coverage. In this paper, we propose to combine the effectiveness of search-based generators with the readability of LLM generated tests. Our approach focuses on improving test and variable names produced by search-based tools, while keeping their semantics (i.e., their coverage) unchanged. Our evaluation on nine industrial and open source LLMs show that our readability improvement transformations are overall semantically-preserving and stable across multiple repetitions. Moreover, a human study with ten professional developers, show that our LLM-improved tests are as readable as developer-written tests, regardless of the LLM employed.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in: 2025 IEEE Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation (ICST)</p></details> |

Traditional approaches often rely on supervised learning models that implicitly encode semantic relationships based on metaphor theories. However, these methods often suffer from a lack of transparency in their decision-making processes, which undermines the reliability of their predictions. Recent research indicates that LLMs (large language models) exhibit significant potential in metaphor detection. Nevertheless, their reasoning capabilities are constrained by predefined knowledge graphs. To overcome these limitations, we propose DMD, a novel dual-perspective framework that harnesses both implicit and explicit applications of metaphor theories to guide LLMs in metaphor detection and adopts a self-judgment mechanism to validate the responses from the aforementioned forms of guidance. In comparison to previous methods, our framework offers more transparent reasoning processes and delivers more reliable predictions. Experimental results prove the effectiveness of DMD, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance across widely-used datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Prior research efforts have focused on supporting the decisions of placing log statements, such as where/what to log, while automated generation or completion of log statements has received little attention. With the increasing use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-related tasks such as code completion or generation, automated methods for generating or completing log statements have gained much momentum. Fine-tuning open-source LLMs like the Llama series is often preferred by enterprises over using commercial ones like the GPT series due to considerations including privacy, security, openness, performance, etc. Fine-tuning LLMs requires task-specific training data and custom-designed processing algorithms, which, however, have not been thoroughly explored for the log statement generation task. This paper fills this gap by contributing such a fine-tuning method LoGFiLM and an exemplar model by using the proposed method to fine-tune Llama-3-8B. Experiments with our own curated dataset and a public dataset show that LoGFiLM consistently outperforms the original Llama-3-8B and the commercial LLMs of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. The results further reveal that fine-tuning Llama-3-8B with data encompassing broader contextual ranges surrounding log statements yields a better model for the automated generation of log statements.</p></details> |  |

Existing defensive prompting techniques rely on a static, unified safety guideline that fails to account for the specific risks inherent in different multimodal contexts. To address these limitations, we propose RapGuard, a novel framework that uses multimodal chain-of-thought reasoning to dynamically generate scenario-specific safety prompts. RapGuard enhances safety by adapting its prompts to the unique risks of each input, effectively mitigating harmful outputs while maintaining high performance on benign tasks. Our experimental results across multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that RapGuard achieves state-of-the-art safety performance, significantly reducing harmful content without degrading the quality of responses.</p></details> |  |

However, these advancements are accompanied by concerns about biased outputs, a challenge that has yet to be thoroughly explored. Existing benchmarks are not sufficiently comprehensive in evaluating biases due to their limited data scale, single questioning format and narrow sources of bias. To address this problem, we introduce VLBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases in LVLMs. VLBiasBench, features a dataset that covers nine distinct categories of social biases, including age, disability status, gender, nationality, physical appearance, race, religion, profession, social economic status, as well as two intersectional bias categories: race x gender and race x social economic status. To build a large-scale dataset, we use Stable Diffusion XL model to generate 46,848 high-quality images, which are combined with various questions to creat 128,342 samples. These questions are divided into open-ended and close-ended types, ensuring thorough consideration of bias sources and a comprehensive evaluation of LVLM biases from multiple perspectives. We conduct extensive evaluations on 15 open-source models as well as two advanced closed-source models, yielding new insights into the biases present in these models.

Proper uncertainty calibration is crucial, yet challenging, for reliable use in areas like healthcare and autonomous driving. This paper investigates representative MLLMs, focusing on their calibration across various scenarios, including before and after visual fine-tuning, as well as before and after multimodal training of the base LLMs. We observed miscalibration in their performance, and at the same time, no significant differences in calibration across these scenarios. We also highlight how uncertainty differs between text and images and how their integration affects overall uncertainty. To better understand MLLMs' miscalibration and their ability to self-assess uncertainty, we construct the IDK (I don't know) dataset, which is key to evaluating how they handle unknowns. Our findings reveal that MLLMs tend to give answers rather than admit uncertainty, but this self-assessment improves with proper prompt adjustments. Finally, to calibrate MLLMs and enhance model reliability, we propose techniques such as temperature scaling and iterative prompt optimization. Our results provide insights into improving MLLMs for effective and responsible deployment in multimodal applications.

Token pruning is an effective solution for speeding up MLLMs, but when and how to drop tokens still remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and training-free approach for the effective visual token pruning of MLLMs, termed FitPrune, which can quickly produce a complete pruning recipe for MLLMs according to a pre-defined budget. Specifically, FitPrune considers token pruning as a statistical problem of MLLM and its objective is to find out an optimal pruning scheme that can minimize the divergence of the attention distributions before and after pruning. In practice, FitPrune can be quickly accomplished based on the attention statistics from a small batch of inference data, avoiding the expensive trials of MLLMs. According to the pruning recipe, an MLLM can directly remove the redundant visual tokens of different examples during inference. To validate FitPrune, we apply it to a set of recent MLLMs, including LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-HR and LLaVA-NEXT, and conduct extensive experiments on a set of benchmarks. The experimental results show that our FitPrune can not only reduce the computational complexity to a large extent, while retaining high performance, e.g., -54.9% FLOPs for LLaVA-NEXT with only 0.5% accuracy drop. Notably, the pruning recipe can be obtained in about 5 minutes. Our code is available at https://github.com/ywh187/FitPrune.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, they have also displayed a higher degree of sensitivity to attacks than previous generation models. To help expose and address this lack of robustness, we introduce a novel ranking attack framework named Attack-in-the-Chain, which tracks interactions between large language models (LLMs) and NRMs based on chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate adversarial examples under black-box settings. Our approach starts by identifying anchor documents with higher ranking positions than the target document as nodes in the reasoning chain. We then dynamically assign the number of perturbation words to each node and prompt LLMs to execute attacks. Finally, we verify the attack performance of all nodes at each reasoning step and proceed to generate the next reasoning step. Empirical results on two web search benchmarks show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI25 |

We test different orders for methods using Kendall Tau distances, including "perfect" (where ground truths come first) and "worst" (where ground truths come last). Our results show a strong bias in order, with Top-1 accuracy falling from 57\% to 20\% when we reverse the code order. Breaking down inputs into smaller contexts helps reduce this bias, narrowing the performance gap between perfect and worst orders from 22\% to just 1\%. We also look at ordering methods based on traditional FL techniques and metrics. Ordering using DepGraph's ranking achieves 48\% Top-1 accuracy, better than more straightforward ordering approaches like CallGraph. These findings underscore the importance of how we structure inputs, manage contexts, and choose ordering methods to improve LLM performance in FL and other software engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate potential harm and prevent misuse, there have been concerted efforts to align the LLMs with human values and legal compliance by incorporating various techniques, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), into the training of the LLMs. However, recent research has exposed that even aligned LLMs are susceptible to adversarial manipulations known as Jailbreak Attacks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a method called Token Highlighter to inspect and mitigate the potential jailbreak threats in the user query. Token Highlighter introduced a concept called Affirmation Loss to measure the LLM's willingness to answer the user query. It then uses the gradient of Affirmation Loss for each token in the user query to locate the jailbreak-critical tokens. Further, Token Highlighter exploits our proposed Soft Removal technique to mitigate the jailbreak effects of critical tokens via shrinking their token embeddings. Experimental results on two aligned LLMs (LLaMA-2 and Vicuna-V1.5) demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively defend against a variety of Jailbreak Attacks while maintaining competent performance on benign questions of the AlpacaEval benchmark. In addition, Token Highlighter is a cost-effective and interpretable defense because it only needs to query the protected LLM once to compute the Affirmation Loss and can highlight the critical tokens upon refusal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025.

We fine-tune the large language model through a low-rank adaptation strategy, which significantly reduces the consumption of computing resources while maintaining the powerful capabilities of the pre-trained model. The experiment uses the QQP task as the evaluation scenario. The results show that the improved LoRA algorithm shows significant improvements in accuracy, F1 score, and MCC compared with traditional models such as BERT, Roberta, T5, and GPT-4. In particular, in terms of F1 score and MCC, our model shows stronger robustness and discrimination ability, which proves the potential of the improved LoRA algorithm in fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models. In addition, this paper also discusses the application prospects of the improved LoRA algorithm in other natural language processing tasks, emphasizing its advantages in multi-task learning and scenarios with limited computing resources. Future research can further optimize the LoRA fine-tuning strategy and expand its application in larger-scale pre-trained models to improve the generalization ability and task adaptability of the model.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAFLITE: Fuzzing Autonomous Systems via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18727v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzz testing effectively uncovers software vulnerabilities; however, it faces challenges with Autonomous Systems (AS) due to their vast search spaces and complex state spaces, which reflect the unpredictability and complexity of real-world environments. This paper presents a universal framework aimed at improving the efficiency of fuzz testing for AS. At its core is SaFliTe, a predictive component that evaluates whether a test case meets predefined safety criteria. By leveraging the large language model (LLM) with information about the test objective and the AS state, SaFliTe assesses the relevance of each test case. We evaluated SaFliTe by instantiating it with various LLMs, including GPT-3.5, Mistral-7B, and Llama2-7B, and integrating it into four fuzz testing tools: PGFuzz, DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB. These tools are designed specifically for testing autonomous drone control systems, such as ArduPilot, PX4, and PX4-Avoidance. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to PGFuzz, SaFliTe increased the likelihood of selecting operations that triggered bug occurrences in each fuzzing iteration by an average of 93.1\%. Additionally, after integrating SaFliTe, the ability of DeepHyperion-UAV, CAMBA, and TUMB to generate test cases that caused system violations increased by 234.5\%, 33.3\%, and 17.8\%, respectively. The benchmark for this evaluation was sourced from a UAV Testing Competition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Large Language Models with Domain-Specific Knowledge: The Case in Topological Materials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13732v2)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have demonstrated impressive performance in the text generation task, showing the ability to understand and respond to complex instructions. However, the performance of naive LLMs in speciffc domains is limited due to the scarcity of domain-speciffc corpora and specialized training. Moreover, training a specialized large-scale model necessitates signiffcant hardware resources, which restricts researchers from leveraging such models to drive advances. Hence, it is crucial to further improve and optimize LLMs to meet speciffc domain demands and enhance their scalability. Based on the condensed matter data center, we establish a material knowledge graph (MaterialsKG) and integrate it with literature. Using large language models and prompt learning, we develop a specialized dialogue system for topological materials called TopoChat. Compared to naive LLMs, TopoChat exhibits superior performance in structural and property querying, material recommendation, and complex relational reasoning. This system enables efffcient and precise retrieval of information and facilitates knowledge interaction, thereby encouraging the advancement on the ffeld of condensed matter materials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Large Language Models for Automated Grading of Student Writing about Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18719v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing writing in large classes for formal or informal learners presents a significant challenge. Consequently, most large classes, particularly in science, rely on objective assessment tools such as multiple-choice quizzes, which have a single correct answer. The rapid development of AI has introduced the possibility of using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate student writing. An experiment was conducted using GPT-4 to determine if machine learning methods based on LLMs can match or exceed the reliability of instructor grading in evaluating short writing assignments on topics in astronomy. The audience consisted of adult learners in three massive open online courses (MOOCs) offered through Coursera. One course was on astronomy, the second was on astrobiology, and the third was on the history and philosophy of astronomy. The results should also be applicable to non-science majors in university settings, where the content and modes of evaluation are similar. The data comprised answers from 120 students to 12 questions across the three courses. GPT-4 was provided with total grades, model answers, and rubrics from an instructor for all three courses. In addition to evaluating how reliably the LLM reproduced instructor grades, the LLM was also tasked with generating its own rubrics. Overall, the LLM was more reliable than peer grading, both in aggregate and by individual student, and approximately matched instructor grades for all three online courses. The implication is that LLMs may soon be used for automated, reliable, and scalable grading of student science writing.</p></details> | Accepted at IJAIE |

Collaborative filtering algorithms, being core to many recommendation systems, have garnered significant attention for their efficiency and interpretability. However, traditional collaborative filtering approaches face numerous challenges when integrated into large-scale LLM-based systems, including high computational costs, severe data sparsity, cold start problems, and lack of scalability. This paper investigates the optimization and scalability of collaborative filtering algorithms in large language models, addressing these limitations through advanced optimization strategies. Firstly, we analyze the fundamental principles of collaborative filtering algorithms and their limitations when applied in LLM-based contexts. Next, several optimization techniques such as matrix factorization, approximate nearest neighbor search, and parallel computing are proposed to enhance computational efficiency and model accuracy. Additionally, strategies such as distributed architecture and model compression are explored to facilitate dynamic updates and scalability in data-intensive environments.</p></details> |  |

Traditional collaborative filtering algorithms are widely used due to their effectiveness in capturing user behavior patterns, but they encounter limitations when dealing with cold start problems and data sparsity. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong natural language understanding and generation capabilities, provide a new breakthrough for recommendation systems. This study proposes an enhanced recommendation method that combines collaborative filtering and LLMs, aiming to leverage collaborative filtering's advantage in modeling user preferences while enhancing the understanding of textual information about users and items through LLMs to improve recommendation accuracy and diversity. This paper first introduces the fundamental theories of collaborative filtering and LLMs, then designs a recommendation system architecture that integrates both, and validates the system's effectiveness through experiments. The results show that the hybrid model based on collaborative filtering and LLMs significantly improves precision, recall, and user satisfaction, demonstrating its potential in complex recommendation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose a large language model based multi-agent framework named AgentsBench, which aims to simultaneously improve both efficiency and quality in judicial decision-making. Our approach leverages multiple LLM-driven agents that simulate the collaborative deliberation and decision making process of a judicial bench. We conducted experiments on legal judgment prediction task, and the results show that our framework outperforms existing LLM based methods in terms of performance and decision quality. By incorporating these elements, our framework reflects real-world judicial processes more closely, enhancing accuracy, fairness, and society consideration. AgentsBench provides a more nuanced and realistic methods of trustworthy AI decision-making, with strong potential for application across various case types and legal scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft version; Under review</p></details> |

Exceptions are thrown during program execution if an unwanted event happens, e.g., a method is invoked with an illegal argument value. Software developers write exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) to check that their code detects unwanted events and throws appropriate exceptions. Prior research studies have shown the importance of EBTs, but those studies also highlighted that developers put most of their efforts on "happy paths", e.g., paths without unwanted events. To help developers fill the gap, we present the first framework, dubbed exLong, that automatically generates EBTs. exLong is a large language model instruction fine-tuned from CodeLlama and embeds reasoning about traces that lead to throw statements, conditional expressions that guard throw statements, and non-exceptional behavior tests that execute similar traces. We compare exLong with the state-of-the-art models for test generation (CAT-LM) and one of the strongest foundation models (GPT-4o), as well as with analysis-based tools for test generation (Randoop and EvoSuite). Our results show that exLong outperforms existing models and tools. Furthermore, we contributed several pull requests to open-source projects and 23 EBTs generated by exLong were already accepted.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICSE ...</summary><p>ICSE 2025 (camera ready)</p></details> |

We argue that LLMs demonstrate that the Distributional Hypothesis (DH) is sufficient for reasonably human-like language performance, and that the emergence of human-meaningful linguistic units among tokens motivates linguistically-informed interventions in existing, linguistically-agnostic tokenization techniques, particularly with respect to their roles as (1) semantic primitives and as (2) vehicles for conveying salient distributional patterns from human language to the model. We explore tokenizations from a BPE tokenizer; extant model vocabularies obtained from Hugging Face and tiktoken; and the information in exemplar token vectors as they move through the layers of a RoBERTa (large) model. Besides creating sub-optimal semantic building blocks and obscuring the model's access to the necessary distributional patterns, we describe how tokenization pretraining can be a backdoor for bias and other unwanted content, which current alignment practices may not remediate. Additionally, we relay evidence that the tokenization algorithm's objective function impacts the LLM's cognition, despite being meaningfully insulated from the main system intelligence.</p></details> |  |

A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models into Assembly Code Obfuscation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16135v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malware authors often employ code obfuscations to make their malware harder to detect. Existing tools for generating obfuscated code often require access to the original source code (e.g., C++ or Java), and adding new obfuscations is a non-trivial, labor-intensive process. In this study, we ask the following question: Can Large Language Models (LLMs) potentially generate a new obfuscated assembly code? If so, this poses a risk to anti-virus engines and potentially increases the flexibility of attackers to create new obfuscation patterns. We answer this in the affirmative by developing the MetamorphASM benchmark comprising MetamorphASM Dataset (MAD) along with three code obfuscation techniques: dead code, register substitution, and control flow change. The MetamorphASM systematically evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate and analyze obfuscated code using MAD, which contains 328,200 obfuscated assembly code samples. We release this dataset and analyze the success rate of various LLMs (e.g., GPT-3.5/4, GPT-4o-mini, Starcoder, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeT5, and LLaMA 3.1) in generating obfuscated assembly code. The evaluation was performed using established information-theoretic metrics and manual human review to ensure correctness and provide the foundation for researchers to study and develop remediations to this risk.

| **[Distilling Fine-grained Sentiment Understanding from Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18552v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained sentiment analysis (FSA) aims to extract and summarize user opinions from vast opinionated text. Recent studies demonstrate that large language models (LLMs) possess exceptional sentiment understanding capabilities. However, directly deploying LLMs for FSA applications incurs high inference costs. Therefore, this paper investigates the distillation of fine-grained sentiment understanding from LLMs into small language models (SLMs). We prompt LLMs to examine and interpret the sentiments of given reviews and then utilize the generated content to pretrain SLMs. Additionally, we develop a comprehensive FSA benchmark to evaluate both SLMs and LLMs. Extensive experiments on this benchmark reveal that: (1) distillation significantly enhances the performance of SLMs in FSA tasks, achieving a 6.00\% improvement in $F_1$-score, and the distilled model can outperform Llama-2-7b with only 220M parameters; (2) distillation equips SLMs with excellent zero-shot sentiment classification capabilities, enabling them to match or even exceed their teacher models. These results suggest that distillation from LLMs is a highly promising direction for FSA. We will release our code, data, and pretrained model weights at \url{https://github.com/HITSZ-HLT/FSA-Distillation}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Zero-Shot Multilingual Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12564v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA), a sequence labeling task, has attracted increasing attention in multilingual contexts. While previous research has focused largely on fine-tuning or training models specifically for ABSA, we evaluate large language models (LLMs) under zero-shot conditions to explore their potential to tackle this challenge with minimal task-specific adaptation. We conduct a comprehensive empirical evaluation of a series of LLMs on multilingual ABSA tasks, investigating various prompting strategies, including vanilla zero-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), self-improvement, self-debate, and self-consistency, across nine different models. Results indicate that while LLMs show promise in handling multilingual ABSA, they generally fall short of fine-tuned, task-specific models. Notably, simpler zero-shot prompts often outperform more complex strategies, especially in high-resource languages like English. These findings underscore the need for further refinement of LLM-based approaches to effectively address ABSA task across diverse languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Large Language Models for Knowledge Graph Question Answering via Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18537v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet struggle with hallucination and outdated knowledge when tasked with complex knowledge reasoning, resulting in factually incorrect outputs. Previous studies have attempted to mitigate it by retrieving factual knowledge from large-scale knowledge graphs (KGs) to assist LLMs in logical reasoning and prediction of answers. However, this kind of approach often introduces noise and irrelevant data, especially in situations with extensive context from multiple knowledge aspects. In this way, LLM attention can be potentially mislead from question and relevant information. In our study, we introduce an Adaptive Multi-Aspect Retrieval-augmented over KGs (Amar) framework. This method retrieves knowledge including entities, relations, and subgraphs, and converts each piece of retrieved text into prompt embeddings. The Amar framework comprises two key sub-components: 1) a self-alignment module that aligns commonalities among entities, relations, and subgraphs to enhance retrieved text, thereby reducing noise interference; 2) a relevance gating module that employs a soft gate to learn the relevance score between question and multi-aspect retrieved data, to determine which information should be used to enhance LLMs' output, or even filtered altogether. Our method has achieved state-of-the-art performance on two common datasets, WebQSP and CWQ, showing a 1.9\% improvement in accuracy over its best competitor and a 6.6\% improvement in logical form generation over a method that directly uses retrieved text as context prompts. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Amar in improving the reasoning of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI'2025</p></details> |

However, DRL demands extensive computational resources to achieve a qualified policy in complex driving scenarios due to its low learning efficiency. Moreover, leveraging expert guidance from human to enhance DRL performance incurs prohibitively high labor costs, which limits its practical application. In this study, we propose a novel large language model (LLM) guided deep reinforcement learning (LGDRL) framework for addressing the decision-making problem of autonomous vehicles. Within this framework, an LLM-based driving expert is integrated into the DRL to provide intelligent guidance for the learning process of DRL. Subsequently, in order to efficiently utilize the guidance of the LLM expert to enhance the performance of DRL decision-making policies, the learning and interaction process of DRL is enhanced through an innovative expert policy constrained algorithm and a novel LLM-intervened interaction mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves superior driving performance with a 90\% task success rate but also significantly improves the learning efficiency and expert guidance utilization efficiency compared to state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Moreover, the proposed method enables the DRL agent to maintain consistent and reliable performance in the absence of LLM expert guidance.

While recent approaches have leveraged various deep learning techniques, including Transformers and complex, parameter-heavy models to achieve significant improvements in restoration effects, we demonstrate that pure CNN architectures with lightweight parameters can achieve comparable results. In this paper, we introduce UIR-PolyKernel, a novel method for underwater image restoration that leverages Polymorphic Large Kernel CNNs. Our approach uniquely combines large kernel convolutions of diverse sizes and shapes to effectively capture long-range dependencies within underwater imagery. Additionally, we introduce a Hybrid Domain Attention module that integrates frequency and spatial domain attention mechanisms to enhance feature importance. By leveraging the frequency domain, we can capture hidden features that may not be perceptible to humans but are crucial for identifying patterns in both underwater and on-air images. This approach enhances the generalization and robustness of our UIR model. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that UIR-PolyKernel achieves state-of-the-art performance in underwater image restoration tasks, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our results show that well-designed pure CNN architectures can effectively compete with more complex models, offering a balance between performance and computational efficiency. This work provides new insights into the potential of CNN-based approaches for challenging image restoration tasks in underwater environments.

An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18443v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The core of the Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) task is to predict and complete the missing relations or nodes in a KG. Common KGC tasks are mostly about inferring unknown elements with one or two elements being known in a triple. In comparison, the Triple Set Prediction (TSP) task is a more realistic knowledge graph completion task. It aims to predict all elements of unknown triples based on the information from known triples. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited significant advancements in language comprehension, demonstrating considerable potential for KGC tasks. However, the potential of LLM on the TSP task has not yet to be investigated. Thus in this paper we proposed a new framework to explore the strengths and limitations of LLM in the TSP task. Specifically, the framework consists of LLM-based rule mining and LLM-based triple set prediction. The relation list of KG embedded within rich semantic information is first leveraged to prompt LLM in the generation of rules. This process is both efficient and independent of statistical information, making it easier to mine effective and realistic rules. For each subgraph, the specified rule is applied in conjunction with the relevant triples within that subgraph to guide the LLM in predicting the missing triples. Subsequently, the predictions from all subgraphs are consolidated to derive the complete set of predicted triples on KG. Finally, the method is evaluated on the relatively complete CFamily dataset. The experimental results indicate that when LLMs are required to adhere to a large amount of factual knowledge to predict missing triples, significant hallucinations occurs, leading to a noticeable decline in performance. To further explore the causes of this phenomenon, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis supported by a detailed case study.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains an open problem that how the EDoF is influenced by the directional radiation pattern of antenna elements. In this work, empowered by the wavenumber-domain channel representation, we analyze the EDoF in a general case where the directivity of antennas, determined by the antenna structure and element spacing, is considered. Specifically, we first reveal the uneven distribution of directivity-aware wavenumber-domain coupling coefficients, i.e., channel gain towards different directions, in the isotropic Rayleigh fading channel. EDoF is then calculated based on such distribution of coupling coefficients. A numerical method is also provided to obtain coupling coefficients via electromagnetic full-wave simulations. Due to the influence of antenna directivity, how EDoF and ergodic channel capacity vary with the element spacing are explored via simulations for different antenna types.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Weak Scaling Capability in Token Space: An Observation from Large Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18387v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling capability has been widely validated with respect to the number of parameters and the size of training data. One important question that is unexplored is that does scaling capability also exists similarly with respect to the number of vision tokens? This study fills the gap by investigating the relationship between the number of vision tokens and the performance of vision-language models. Our theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations reveal that the model exhibits weak scaling capabilities on the length \(N_l\), with performance approximately \(S(N_l) \approx (c/N_l)^{\alpha}\), where \(c, \alpha\) are hyperparameters. Interestingly, this scaling behavior remains largely unaffected by the inclusion or exclusion of the user's question in the input. Furthermore, fusing the user's question with the vision token can enhance model performance when the question is relevant to the task. To address the computational challenges associated with large-scale vision tokens, we propose a novel architecture that efficiently reduces the token count while integrating user question tokens into the representation. Our findings may offer insights for developing more efficient and effective vision-language models under specific task constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Agents Based on Large Language Models for Knowledge-based Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18351v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in knowledge-based Visual Question Answering (VQA). However existing methods still have challenges: the inability to use external tools autonomously, and the inability to work in teams. Humans tend to know whether they need to use external tools when they encounter a new question, e.g., they tend to be able to give a direct answer to a familiar question, whereas they tend to use tools such as search engines when they encounter an unfamiliar question. In addition, humans also tend to collaborate and discuss with others to get better answers. Inspired by this, we propose the multi-agent voting framework. We design three LLM-based agents that simulate different levels of staff in a team, and assign the available tools according to the levels. Each agent provides the corresponding answer, and finally all the answers provided by the agents are voted to get the final answer. Experiments on OK-VQA and A-OKVQA show that our approach outperforms other baselines by 2.2 and 1.0, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, the value of AI-generated metadata, such as titles, remains unclear on user-generated content (UGC) platforms. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale field experiment on a leading short-video platform in Asia to provide about 1 million users access to AI-generated titles for their uploaded videos. Our findings show that the provision of AI-generated titles significantly boosted content consumption, increasing valid watches by 1.6% and watch duration by 0.9%. When producers adopted these titles, these increases jumped to 7.1% and 4.1%, respectively. This viewership-boost effect was largely attributed to the use of this generative AI (GAI) tool increasing the likelihood of videos having a title by 41.4%. The effect was more pronounced for groups more affected by metadata sparsity. Mechanism analysis revealed that AI-generated metadata improved user-video matching accuracy in the platform's recommender system. Interestingly, for a video for which the producer would have posted a title anyway, adopting the AI-generated title decreased its viewership on average, implying that AI-generated titles may be of lower quality than human-generated ones. However, when producers chose to co-create with GAI and significantly revised the AI-generated titles, the videos outperformed their counterparts with either fully AI-generated or human-generated titles, showcasing the benefits of human-AI co-creation. This study highlights the value of AI-generated metadata and human-AI metadata co-creation in enhancing user-content matching and content consumption for UGC platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory-Efficient Gradient Unrolling for Large-Scale Bi-level Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14095v2)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bi-level optimization (BO) has become a fundamental mathematical framework for addressing hierarchical machine learning problems. As deep learning models continue to grow in size, the demand for scalable bi-level optimization solutions has become increasingly critical. Traditional gradient-based bi-level optimization algorithms, due to their inherent characteristics, are ill-suited to meet the demands of large-scale applications. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{F}$orward $\textbf{G}$radient $\textbf{U}$nrolling with $\textbf{F}$orward $\textbf{F}$radient, abbreviated as $(\textbf{FG})^2\textbf{U}$, which achieves an unbiased stochastic approximation of the meta gradient for bi-level optimization. $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ circumvents the memory and approximation issues associated with classical bi-level optimization approaches, and delivers significantly more accurate gradient estimates than existing large-scale bi-level optimization approaches. Additionally, $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ is inherently designed to support parallel computing, enabling it to effectively leverage large-scale distributed computing systems to achieve significant computational efficiency. In practice, $(\text{FG})^2\text{U}$ and other methods can be strategically placed at different stages of the training process to achieve a more cost-effective two-phase paradigm.

| **[The Dark Side of Function Calling: Pathways to Jailbreaking Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17915v4)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, but their power comes with significant security considerations. While extensive research has been conducted on the safety of LLMs in chat mode, the security implications of their function calling feature have been largely overlooked. This paper uncovers a critical vulnerability in the function calling process of LLMs, introducing a novel "jailbreak function" attack method that exploits alignment discrepancies, user coercion, and the absence of rigorous safety filters. Our empirical study, conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5-Sonnet, and Gemini-1.5-pro, reveals an alarming average success rate of over 90\% for this attack. We provide a comprehensive analysis of why function calls are susceptible to such attacks and propose defensive strategies, including the use of defensive prompts. Our findings highlight the urgent need for enhanced security measures in the function calling capabilities of LLMs, contributing to the field of AI safety by identifying a previously unexplored risk, designing an effective attack method, and suggesting practical defensive measures.

This paper presents a novel multi-prompt ensemble decoding approach designed to bolster the generation quality of LLMs by leveraging the aggregation of outcomes from multiple prompts. Given a unique input $X$, we submit $n$ variations of prompts with $X$ to LLMs in batch mode to decode and derive probability distributions. For each token prediction, we calculate the ensemble probability by averaging the $n$ probability distributions within the batch, utilizing this aggregated probability to generate the token. This technique is dubbed Inner-Batch Ensemble. To facilitate efficient batch inference, we implement a Left-Padding strategy to maintain uniform input lengths across the n prompts. Through extensive experimentation on diverse NLP tasks, including machine translation, code generation, and text simplification, we demonstrate the efficacy of our method in enhancing LLM performance. The results show substantial improvements in BLEU scores, pass@$k$ rates, and LENS metrics over conventional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Multi-Step Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models with Direct Advantage Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18279v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The role of reinforcement learning (RL) in enhancing the reasoning of large language models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly significant. Despite the success of RL in many scenarios, there are still many challenges in improving the reasoning of LLMs. One challenge is the sparse reward, which makes optimization difficult for RL and necessitates a large amount of data samples. Another challenge stems from the inherent instability of RL, particularly when using Actor-Critic (AC) methods to derive optimal policies, which often leads to unstable training processes. To address these issues, we introduce Direct Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO), an novel step-level offline RL algorithm. Unlike standard alignment that rely solely outcome rewards to optimize policies (such as DPO), DAPO employs a critic function to predict the reasoning accuracy at each step, thereby generating dense signals to refine the generation strategy. Additionally, the Actor and Critic components in DAPO are trained independently, avoiding the co-training instability observed in standard AC algorithms like PPO. We train DAPO on mathematical and code query datasets and then evaluate its performance on multiple benchmarks. Our results show that DAPO can effectively enhance the mathematical and code capabilities on both SFT models and RL models, demonstrating the effectiveness of DAPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Large Language Models for Code Vulnerability Detection: An Experimental Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18260v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code vulnerability detection (CVD) is essential for addressing and preventing system security issues, playing a crucial role in ensuring software security. Previous learning-based vulnerability detection methods rely on either fine-tuning medium-size sequence models or training smaller neural networks from scratch. Recent advancements in large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have showcased remarkable capabilities in various code intelligence tasks including code understanding and generation. However, the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting code vulnerabilities is largely under-explored. This work aims to investigate the gap by fine-tuning LLMs for the CVD task, involving four widely-used open-source LLMs. We also implement other five previous graph-based or medium-size sequence models for comparison. Experiments are conducted on five commonly-used CVD datasets, including both the part of short samples and long samples. In addition, we conduct quantitative experiments to investigate the class imbalance issue and the model's performance on samples of different lengths, which are rarely studied in previous works. To better facilitate communities, we open-source all codes and resources of this study in https://github.com/SakiRinn/LLM4CVD and https://huggingface.co/datasets/xuefen/VulResource.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[An Automatic Graph Construction Framework based on Large Language Models for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18241v1)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as state-of-the-art methods to learn from graph-structured data for recommendation. However, most existing GNN-based recommendation methods focus on the optimization of model structures and learning strategies based on pre-defined graphs, neglecting the importance of the graph construction stage. Earlier works for graph construction usually rely on speciffic rules or crowdsourcing, which are either too simplistic or too labor-intensive. Recent works start to utilize large language models (LLMs) to automate the graph construction, in view of their abundant open-world knowledge and remarkable reasoning capabilities. Nevertheless, they generally suffer from two limitations: (1) invisibility of global view (e.g., overlooking contextual information) and (2) construction inefficiency. To this end, we introduce AutoGraph, an automatic graph construction framework based on LLMs for recommendation. Specifically, we first use LLMs to infer the user preference and item knowledge, which is encoded as semantic vectors. Next, we employ vector quantization to extract the latent factors from the semantic vectors. The latent factors are then incorporated as extra nodes to link the user/item nodes, resulting in a graph with in-depth global-view semantics. We further design metapath-based message aggregation to effectively aggregate the semantic and collaborative information. The framework is model-agnostic and compatible with different backbone models. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the efficacy and efffciency of AutoGraph compared to existing baseline methods. We have deployed AutoGraph in Huawei advertising platform, and gain a 2.69% improvement on RPM and a 7.31% improvement on eCPM in the online A/B test. Currently AutoGraph has been used as the main trafffc model, serving hundreds of millions of people.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Can Large Language Models Improve the Adversarial Robustness of Graph Neural Networks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08685v3)** | 2024-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, especially for topology perturbations, and many methods that improve the robustness of GNNs have received considerable attention. Recently, we have witnessed the significant success of large language models (LLMs), leading many to explore the great potential of LLMs on GNNs. However, they mainly focus on improving the performance of GNNs by utilizing LLMs to enhance the node features. Therefore, we ask: Will the robustness of GNNs also be enhanced with the powerful understanding and inference capabilities of LLMs? By presenting the empirical results, we find that despite that LLMs can improve the robustness of GNNs, there is still an average decrease of 23.1% in accuracy, implying that the GNNs remain extremely vulnerable against topology attacks. Therefore, another question is how to extend the capabilities of LLMs on graph adversarial robustness. In this paper, we propose an LLM-based robust graph structure inference framework, LLM4RGNN, which distills the inference capabilities of GPT-4 into a local LLM for identifying malicious edges and an LM-based edge predictor for finding missing important edges, so as to recover a robust graph structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLM4RGNN consistently improves the robustness across various GNNs. Even in some cases where the perturbation ratio increases to 40%, the accuracy of GNNs is still better than that on the clean graph.

Traditional Image Content Moderation (ICM) models fall short in producing precise moderation decisions for diverse standards, while recent multimodal large language models (MLLMs), when adopted to general rule-based ICM, often produce classification and explanation results that are inconsistent with human moderators. Aiming at flexible, explainable, and accurate ICM, we design a novel rule-based dataset generation pipeline, decomposing concise human-defined rules and leveraging well-designed multi-stage prompts to enrich short explicit image annotations. Our ICM-Instruct dataset includes detailed moderation explanation and moderation Q-A pairs. Built upon it, we create our ICM-Assistant model in the framework of rule-based ICM, making it readily applicable in real practice. Our ICM-Assistant model demonstrates exceptional performance and flexibility. Specifically, it significantly outperforms existing approaches on various sources, improving both the moderation classification (36.8\% on average) and moderation explanation quality (26.6\% on average) consistently over existing MLLMs. Code/Data is available at https://github.com/zhaoyuzhi/ICM-Assistant.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

However, their application in anomaly detection and prediction remains underexplored, with growing concerns regarding their black-box nature, lack of interpretability and applicability. This paper critically evaluates the efficacy of TSFM in anomaly detection and prediction tasks. We systematically analyze TSFM across multiple datasets, including those characterized by the absence of discernible patterns, trends and seasonality. Our analysis shows that while TSFMs can be extended for anomaly detection and prediction, traditional statistical and deep learning models often match or outperform TSFM in these tasks. Additionally, TSFMs require high computational resources but fail to capture sequential dependencies effectively or improve performance in few-shot or zero-shot scenarios. \noindent The preprocessed datasets, codes to reproduce the results and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/smtmnfg/TSFM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables.

Owing to its vast volume, diverse sources, and temporal properties, RS data is highly suitable for the development of large Visual Foundation Models (VFMs). VFMs act as robust feature extractors, learning from extensive RS data, and are subsequently fine-tuned for deployment in various geoscientific tasks. However, current VFMs in the RS domain are predominantly pretrained and tailored exclusively for specific characteristics of RS imagery, neglecting the potential of utilizing the multi-dimensional properties of RS data. Therefore, in this work, we propose SeaMo, a pioneering visual foundation model that integrates multi-seasonal and multimodal information in the RS field. SeaMo is designed to harness multiple properties of RS data. Within the masked image modeling framework, we employ non-aligned cropping techniques to extract spatial properties, use multi-source inputs for multimodal integration, and incorporate temporal-multimodal fusion blocks for effective assimilation of multi-seasonal data. SeaMo explicitly models the multi-dimensional properties of RS data, making the model more comprehensive, robust, and versatile. We applied SeaMo to several downstream geoscience tasks, which demonstrated exceptional performance. Extensive ablation studies were conducted to validate the model's superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structured Speaker-Deficiency Adaptation of Foundation Models for Dysarthric and Elderly Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18832v1)** | 2024-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-intensive fine-tuning of speech foundation models (SFMs) to scarce and diverse dysarthric and elderly speech leads to data bias and poor generalization to unseen speakers. This paper proposes novel structured speaker-deficiency adaptation approaches for SSL pre-trained SFMs on such data. Speaker and speech deficiency invariant SFMs were constructed in their supervised adaptive fine-tuning stage to reduce undue bias to training data speakers, and serves as a more neutral and robust starting point for test time unsupervised adaptation. Speech variability attributed to speaker identity and speech impairment severity, or aging induced neurocognitive decline, are modelled using separate adapters that can be combined together to model any seen or unseen speaker. Experiments on the UASpeech dysarthric and DementiaBank Pitt elderly speech corpora suggest structured speaker-deficiency adaptation of HuBERT and Wav2vec2-conformer models consistently outperforms baseline SFMs using either: a) no adapters; b) global adapters shared among all speakers; or c) single attribute adapters modelling speaker or deficiency labels alone by statistically significant WER reductions up to 3.01% and 1.50% absolute (10.86% and 6.94% relative) on the two tasks respectively. The lowest published WER of 19.45% (49.34% on very low intelligibility, 33.17% on unseen words) is obtained on the UASpeech test set of 16 dysarthric speakers.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. Fine-tuning significantly improves accuracy, indicating that zero-shot use is not optimal for VaR forecasting.</p></details> |  |

We introduce XRAG, an open-source, modular codebase that facilitates exhaustive evaluation of the performance of foundational components of advanced RAG modules. These components are systematically categorized into four core phases: pre-retrieval, retrieval, post-retrieval, and generation. We systematically analyse them across reconfigured datasets, providing a comprehensive benchmark for their effectiveness. As the complexity of RAG systems continues to escalate, we underscore the critical need to identify potential failure points in RAG systems. We formulate a suite of experimental methodologies and diagnostic testing protocols to dissect the failure points inherent in RAG engineering. Subsequently, we proffer bespoke solutions aimed at bolstering the overall performance of these modules. Our work thoroughly evaluates the performance of advanced core components in RAG systems, providing insights into optimizations for prevalent failure points.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in large-scale outdoor datasets remains constrained by the scarcity of accurate supervision signals, the extensive noise caused by variable outdoor conditions, and the abundance of unknown objects. In this work, we propose a novel label-free learning method, Adaptive Label Correction (AdaCo), for 3D semantic segmentation. AdaCo first introduces the Cross-modal Label Generation Module (CLGM), providing cross-modal supervision with the formidable interpretive capabilities of the VFMs. Subsequently, AdaCo incorporates the Adaptive Noise Corrector (ANC), updating and adjusting the noisy samples within this supervision iteratively during training. Moreover, we develop an Adaptive Robust Loss (ARL) function to modulate each sample's sensitivity to noisy supervision, preventing potential underfitting issues associated with robust loss. Our proposed AdaCo can effectively mitigate the performance limitations of label-free learning networks in 3D semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments on two outdoor benchmark datasets highlight the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | 2025 AAAI |

In the typical FL paradigm (e.g., FedAvg), model weights are sent to and from the server each round to participating clients. Recently, the use of small pre-trained models has been shown to be effective in federated learning optimization and improving convergence. However, recent state-of-the-art pre-trained models are getting more capable but also have more parameters, known as the "Foundation Models." In conventional FL, sharing the enormous model weights can quickly put a massive communication burden on the system, especially if more capable models are employed. Can we find a solution to enable those strong and readily available pre-trained models in FL to achieve excellent performance while simultaneously reducing the communication burden? To this end, we investigate the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in federated learning and thus introduce a new framework: FedPEFT. Specifically, we systemically evaluate the performance of FedPEFT across a variety of client stability, data distribution, and differential privacy settings. By only locally tuning and globally sharing a small portion of the model weights, significant reductions in the total communication overhead can be achieved while maintaining competitive or even better performance in a wide range of federated learning scenarios, providing insight into a new paradigm for practical and effective federated systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data</p></details> |

Given the complexities of these high-dimensional models, traditional techniques for constraining agent behavior, which typically rely on low-dimensional, discrete state and action spaces, cannot be directly applied. Drawing inspiration from robotic action selection techniques, we propose the grounded observer framework for constraining foundation model behavior that offers both behavioral guarantees and real-time variability. This method leverages real-time assessment of low-level behavioral characteristics to dynamically adjust model actions and provide contextual feedback. To demonstrate this, we develop a system capable of sustaining contextually appropriate, casual conversations ("small talk"), which we then apply to a robot for novel, unscripted interactions with humans. Finally, we discuss potential applications of the framework for other social contexts and areas for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2412.18023</p></details> |

Artificial Life (ALife) has not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life, Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human ingenuity alone.</p></details> | 27 pages, 17 figures |

However, existing FMs still perform poorly in the energy fields, such as building energy forecasting (BEF). This paper studies the adaptation of FM to BEF tasks. We demonstrate the shortcomings of fine-tuning FM straightforwardly from both the perspectives of FM and the data. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new \textit{contrastive curriculum learning}-based training method. Our method optimizes the ordering of training data in the context of TSFM adaptation.

The VAE framework uses hyper-priors to model latent space dependencies, enhancing compression efficiency. The SR module refines low-resolution representations into high-resolution outputs, improving reconstruction quality. By alternating between 2D and 3D convolutions, the model efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations in scientific data while maintaining low computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the FM generalizes well to unseen domains and varying data shapes, achieving up to 4 times higher compression ratios than state-of-the-art methods after domain-specific fine-tuning. The SR module improves compression ratio by 30 percent compared to simple upsampling techniques. This approach significantly reduces storage and transmission costs for large-scale scientific simulations while preserving data integrity and fidelity.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we instead propose and study a more challenging type of retrieval task, called hidden rationale retrieval, in which query and document are not similar but can be inferred by reasoning chains, logic relationships, or empirical experiences. To address such problems, an instruction-tuned Large language model (LLM) with a cross-encoder architecture could be a reasonable choice. To further strengthen pioneering LLM-based retrievers, we design a special instruction that transforms the retrieval task into a generative task by prompting LLM to answer a binary-choice question. The model can be fine-tuned with direct preference optimization (DPO). The framework is also optimized for computational efficiency with no performance degradation. We name this retrieval framework by RaHoRe and verify its zero-shot and fine-tuned performance superiority on Emotional Support Conversation (ESC), compared with previous retrieval works. Our study suggests the potential to employ LLM as a foundation for a wider scope of retrieval tasks.

Social science has a long history of studying the social impacts of transformative technologies in terms of pre-existing systems of power and how these systems are disrupted or reinforced by new technologies. In this position paper, we build on prior work studying the social impacts of earlier technologies to propose a conceptual framework studying foundation models as sociotechnical systems, incorporating social science expertise to better understand how these models affect systems of power, anticipate the impacts of deploying these models in various applications, and study the effectiveness of technical interventions intended to mitigate social harms. We advocate for an interdisciplinary and collaborative research paradigm between AI and social science across all stages of foundation model research and development to promote socially responsible research practices and use cases, and outline several strategies to facilitate such research.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Suitability of pre-trained foundational LLMs for Analysis in German Legal Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15902v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that current open-source foundational LLMs possess instruction capability and German legal background knowledge that is sufficient for some legal analysis in an educational context. However, model capability breaks down in very specific tasks, such as the classification of "Gutachtenstil" appraisal style components, or with complex contexts, such as complete legal opinions. Even with extended context and effective prompting strategies, they cannot match the Bag-of-Words baseline. To combat this, we introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation based prompt example selection method that substantially improves predictions in high data availability scenarios. We further evaluate the performance of pre-trained LLMs on two standard tasks for argument mining and automated essay scoring and find it to be more adequate. Throughout, pre-trained LLMs improve upon the baseline in scenarios with little or no labeled data with Chain-of-Thought prompting further helping in the zero-shot case.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Semantic Foundations of Reductive Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14758v2)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of logic has largely been through the 'deductive' paradigm: conclusions are inferred from established premisses. However, the use of logic in the context of both human and machine reasoning is typically through the dual 'reductive' perspective: collections of sufficient premisses are generated from putative conclusions. We call this paradigm, 'reductive logic'. This expression of logic encompass as diverse reasoning activities as proving a formula in a formal system to seeking to meet a friend before noon on Saturday. This paper is a semantical analysis of reductive logic. In particular, we provide mathematical foundations for representing and reasoning about 'reduction operators'. Heuristically, reduction operators may be thought of as `backwards' inference rules. In this paper, we address their mathematical representation, how they are used in the context of reductive reasoning, and, crucially, what makes them 'valid'.</p></details> |  |

First, we prove the availability of rotary position embedding in the state space duality algorithm, which reduces the perplexity of the hybrid quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality by more than 4%, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation unifies position encoding. Second, we propose dynamic mask attention, which maintains 100% accuracy in the more challenging multi-query associative recall task, improving by more than 150% compared to quadratic causal self-attention and state space duality, to ensure that the combining sequence transformation selectively filters relevant information. Third, we design cross domain mixture of experts, which makes the computational speed of expert retrieval with more than 1024 experts 8 to 10 times faster than the mixture of experts, to ensure that the combining state transformation quickly retrieval mixture. Finally, we summarize these matrix algorithms that can form the foundation model: Wonderful Matrices, which can be a competitor to popular model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/LoserCheems/WonderfulMatrices</p></details> |

Developed as part of Singapore's National Multimodal Large Language Model Programme, the MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder is tailored to address the speech processing needs in Singapore and the surrounding Southeast Asian region. The model currently supports mainly English, including the variety spoken in Singapore. We are actively expanding our datasets to gradually cover other languages in subsequent releases. The MERaLiON-SpeechEncoder was pre-trained from scratch on 200,000 hours of unlabelled speech data using a self-supervised learning approach based on masked language modelling. We describe our training procedure and hyperparameter tuning experiments in detail below. Our evaluation demonstrates improvements to spontaneous and Singapore speech benchmarks for speech recognition, while remaining competitive to other state-of-the-art speech encoders across ten other speech tasks. We commit to releasing our model, supporting broader research endeavours, both in Singapore and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continual Learning Using a Kernel-Based Method Over Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15571v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) learns a sequence of tasks incrementally. This paper studies the challenging CL setting of class-incremental learning (CIL). CIL has two key challenges: catastrophic forgetting (CF) and inter-task class separation (ICS). Despite numerous proposed methods, these issues remain persistent obstacles. This paper proposes a novel CIL method, called Kernel Linear Discriminant Analysis (KLDA), that can effectively avoid CF and ICS problems. It leverages only the powerful features learned in a foundation model (FM). However, directly using these features proves suboptimal. To address this, KLDA incorporates the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and its Random Fourier Features (RFF) to enhance the feature representations from the FM, leading to improved performance. When a new task arrives, KLDA computes only the mean for each class in the task and updates a shared covariance matrix for all learned classes based on the kernelized features. Classification is performed using Linear Discriminant Analysis. Our empirical evaluation using text and image classification datasets demonstrates that KLDA significantly outperforms baselines. Remarkably, without relying on replay data, KLDA achieves accuracy comparable to joint training of all classes, which is considered the upper bound for CIL performance. The KLDA code is available at https://github.com/salehmomeni/klda.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards scientific discovery with dictionary learning: Extracting biological concepts from microscopy foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16247v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dictionary learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful interpretability tool for large language models. By extracting known concepts (e.g., Golden-Gate Bridge) from human-interpretable data (e.g., text), sparse DL can elucidate a model's inner workings. In this work, we ask if DL can also be used to discover unknown concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data (e.g., cell images), ultimately enabling modern approaches to scientific discovery. As a first step, we use DL algorithms to study microscopy foundation models trained on multi-cell image data, where little prior knowledge exists regarding which high-level concepts should arise. We show that sparse dictionaries indeed extract biologically-meaningful concepts such as cell type and genetic perturbation type. We also propose a new DL algorithm, Iterative Codebook Feature Learning~(ICFL), and combine it with a pre-processing step that uses PCA whitening from a control dataset. In our experiments, we demonstrate that both ICFL and PCA improve the selectivity of extracted features compared to TopK sparse autoencoders.</p></details> |  |

However, their open nature also makes them vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors, including state-sponsored entities, who can conduct information operations (IOs) to manipulate public opinion. The spread of misinformation, false news, and misleading claims threatens democratic processes and societal cohesion, making it crucial to develop methods for the timely detection of inauthentic activity to protect the integrity of online discourse. In this work, we introduce a methodology designed to identify users orchestrating information operations, a.k.a. \textit{IO drivers}, across various influence campaigns. Our framework, named \texttt{IOHunter}, leverages the combined strengths of Language Models and Graph Neural Networks to improve generalization in \emph{supervised}, \emph{scarcely-supervised}, and \emph{cross-IO} contexts. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple sets of IOs originating from six countries, significantly surpassing existing approaches. This research marks a step toward developing Graph Foundation Models specifically tailored for the task of IO detection on social media platforms.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Relational Programming with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14515v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have vast potential to enable diverse AI applications. The powerful yet incomplete nature of these models has spurred a wide range of mechanisms to augment them with capabilities such as in-context learning, information retrieval, and code interpreting. We propose Vieira, a declarative framework that unifies these mechanisms in a general solution for programming with foundation models. Vieira follows a probabilistic relational paradigm and treats foundation models as stateless functions with relational inputs and outputs. It supports neuro-symbolic applications by enabling the seamless combination of such models with logic programs, as well as complex, multi-modal applications by streamlining the composition of diverse sub-models. We implement Vieira by extending the Scallop compiler with a foreign interface that supports foundation models as plugins. We implement plugins for 12 foundation models including GPT, CLIP, and SAM. We evaluate Vieira on 9 challenging tasks that span language, vision, and structured and vector databases. Our evaluation shows that programs in Vieira are concise, can incorporate modern foundation models, and have comparable or better accuracy than competitive baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Vision-Language Foundation Model to Enhance Efficiency of Chest X-ray Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12208v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over 1.4 billion chest X-rays (CXRs) are performed annually due to their cost-effectiveness as an initial diagnostic test. This scale of radiological studies provides a significant opportunity to streamline CXR interpretation and documentation. While foundation models are a promising solution, the lack of publicly available large-scale datasets and benchmarks inhibits their iterative development and real-world evaluation. To overcome these challenges, we constructed a large-scale dataset (CheXinstruct), which we utilized to train a vision-language foundation model (CheXagent). We systematically demonstrated competitive performance across eight distinct task types on our novel evaluation benchmark (CheXbench). Beyond technical validation, we assessed the real-world utility of CheXagent in directly drafting radiology reports. Our clinical assessment with eight radiologists revealed a 36% time saving for residents using CheXagent-drafted reports, while attending radiologists showed no significant time difference editing resident-drafted or CheXagent-drafted reports. The CheXagent-drafted reports improved the writing efficiency of both radiology residents and attending radiologists in 81% and 61% of cases, respectively, without loss of quality. Overall, we demonstrate that CheXagent can effectively perform a variety of CXR interpretation tasks and holds potential to assist radiologists in routine clinical workflows.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Foundation Models Meet Low-Cost Sensors: Test-Time Adaptation for Rescaling Disparity for Zero-Shot Metric Depth Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14103v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of foundation models for monocular depth estimation such as Depth Anything paved the way to zero-shot monocular depth estimation. Since it returns an affine-invariant disparity map, the favored technique to recover the metric depth consists in fine-tuning the model. However, this stage is costly to perform because of the training but also due to the creation of the dataset. It must contain images captured by the camera that will be used at test time and the corresponding ground truth. Moreover, the fine-tuning may also degrade the generalizing capacity of the original model. Instead, we propose in this paper a new method to rescale Depth Anything predictions using 3D points provided by low-cost sensors or techniques such as low-resolution LiDAR, stereo camera, structure-from-motion where poses are given by an IMU. Thus, this approach avoids fine-tuning and preserves the generalizing power of the original depth estimation model while being robust to the noise of the sensor or of the depth model. Our experiments highlight improvements relative to other metric depth estimation methods and competitive results compared to fine-tuned approaches.

| **[Adaptive Concept Bottleneck for Foundation Models Under Distribution Shifts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14097v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in foundation models (FMs) have led to a paradigm shift in machine learning. The rich, expressive feature representations from these pre-trained, large-scale FMs are leveraged for multiple downstream tasks, usually via lightweight fine-tuning of a shallow fully-connected network following the representation. However, the non-interpretable, black-box nature of this prediction pipeline can be a challenge, especially in critical domains such as healthcare, finance, and security. In this paper, we explore the potential of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) for transforming complex, non-interpretable foundation models into interpretable decision-making pipelines using high-level concept vectors. Specifically, we focus on the test-time deployment of such an interpretable CBM pipeline "in the wild", where the input distribution often shifts from the original training distribution. We first identify the potential failure modes of such a pipeline under different types of distribution shifts. Then we propose an adaptive concept bottleneck framework to address these failure modes, that dynamically adapts the concept-vector bank and the prediction layer based solely on unlabeled data from the target domain, without access to the source (training) dataset. Empirical evaluations with various real-world distribution shifts show that our adaptation method produces concept-based interpretations better aligned with the test data and boosts post-deployment accuracy by up to 28%, aligning the CBM performance with that of non-interpretable classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The preliminary version of the work appeared in the ICML 2024 Workshop on Foundation Models in the Wild</p></details> |
| **[Data-Efficient Inference of Neural Fluid Fields via SciML Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13897v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in 3D vision have enabled successful progress in inferring neural fluid fields and realistic rendering of fluid dynamics. However, these methods require real-world flow captures, which demand dense video sequences and specialized lab setups, making the process costly and challenging. Scientific machine learning (SciML) foundation models, which are pretrained on extensive simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), encode rich multiphysics knowledge and thus provide promising sources of domain priors for inferring fluid fields. Nevertheless, their potential to advance real-world vision problems remains largely underexplored, raising questions about the transferability and practical utility of these foundation models. In this work, we demonstrate that SciML foundation model can significantly improve the data efficiency of inferring real-world 3D fluid dynamics with improved generalization. At the core of our method is leveraging the strong forecasting capabilities and meaningful representations of SciML foundation models. We equip neural fluid fields with a novel collaborative training approach that utilizes augmented views and fluid features extracted by our foundation model. Our method demonstrates significant improvements in both quantitative metrics and visual quality, showcasing the practical applicability of SciML foundation models in real-world fluid dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Toxicity in Open Source Software Communications Using Psycholinguistics and Moral Foundations Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13133v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies have shown that toxic behavior can cause contributors to leave, and hinder newcomers' (especially from underrepresented communities) participation in Open Source Software (OSS) projects. Thus, detection of toxic language plays a crucial role in OSS collaboration and inclusivity. Off-the-shelf toxicity detectors are ineffective when applied to OSS communications, due to the distinct nature of toxicity observed in these channels (e.g., entitlement and arrogance are more frequently observed on GitHub than on Reddit or Twitter). In this paper, we investigate a machine learning-based approach for the automatic detection of toxic communications in OSS. We leverage psycholinguistic lexicons, and Moral Foundations Theory to analyze toxicity in two types of OSS communication channels; issue comments and code reviews. Our evaluation indicates that our approach can achieve a significant performance improvement (up to 7% increase in F1 score) over the existing domain-specific toxicity detector. We found that using moral values as features is more effective than linguistic cues, resulting in 67.50% F1-measure in identifying toxic instances in code review data and 64.83% in issue comments. While the detection accuracy is far from accurate, this improvement demonstrates the potential of integrating moral and psycholinguistic features in toxicity detection models. These findings highlight the importance of context-specific models that consider the unique communication styles within OSS, where interpersonal and value-driven language dynamics differ markedly from general social media platforms. Future work could focus on refining these models to further enhance detection accuracy, possibly by incorporating community-specific norms and conversational context to better capture the nuanced expressions of toxicity in OSS environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of the Theory of Performance-Based Ranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04227v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ranking entities such as algorithms, devices, methods, or models based on their performances, while accounting for application-specific preferences, is a challenge. To address this challenge, we establish the foundations of a universal theory for performance-based ranking. First, we introduce a rigorous framework built on top of both the probability and order theories. Our new framework encompasses the elements necessary to (1) manipulate performances as mathematical objects, (2) express which performances are worse than or equivalent to others, (3) model tasks through a variable called satisfaction, (4) consider properties of the evaluation, (5) define scores, and (6) specify application-specific preferences through a variable called importance. On top of this framework, we propose the first axiomatic definition of performance orderings and performance-based rankings. Then, we introduce a universal parametric family of scores, called ranking scores, that can be used to establish rankings satisfying our axioms, while considering application-specific preferences. Finally, we show, in the case of two-class classification, that the family of ranking scores encompasses well-known performance scores, including the accuracy, the true positive rate (recall, sensitivity), the true negative rate (specificity), the positive predictive value (precision), and F1. However, we also show that some other scores commonly used to compare classifiers are unsuitable to derive performance orderings satisfying the axioms. Therefore, this paper provides the computer vision and machine learning communities with a rigorous framework for evaluating and ranking entities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARATR-X: Towards Building A Foundation Model for SAR Target Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09365v3)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable progress in synthetic aperture radar automatic target recognition (SAR ATR), recent efforts have concentrated on detecting and classifying a specific category, e.g., vehicles, ships, airplanes, or buildings. One of the fundamental limitations of the top-performing SAR ATR methods is that the learning paradigm is supervised, task-specific, limited-category, closed-world learning, which depends on massive amounts of accurately annotated samples that are expensively labeled by expert SAR analysts and have limited generalization capability and scalability. In this work, we make the first attempt towards building a foundation model for SAR ATR, termed SARATR-X. SARATR-X learns generalizable representations via self-supervised learning (SSL) and provides a cornerstone for label-efficient model adaptation to generic SAR target detection and classification tasks. Specifically, SARATR-X is trained on 0.18 M unlabelled SAR target samples, which are curated by combining contemporary benchmarks and constitute the largest publicly available dataset till now. Considering the characteristics of SAR images, a backbone tailored for SAR ATR is carefully designed, and a two-step SSL method endowed with multi-scale gradient features was applied to ensure the feature diversity and model scalability of SARATR-X. The capabilities of SARATR-X are evaluated on classification under few-shot and robustness settings and detection across various categories and scenes, and impressive performance is achieved, often competitive with or even superior to prior fully supervised, semi-supervised, or self-supervised algorithms. Our SARATR-X and the curated dataset are released at https://github.com/waterdisappear/SARATR-X to foster research into foundation models for SAR image interpretation.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Efficient Transfer Learning for Video-language Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11223v2)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models provide a robust foundation for efficient transfer learning across various downstream tasks. In the field of video action recognition, mainstream approaches often introduce additional parameter modules to capture temporal information. While the increased model capacity brought by these additional parameters helps better fit the video-specific inductive biases, existing methods require learning a large number of parameters and are prone to catastrophic forgetting of the original generalizable knowledge. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Multi-modal Spatio-Temporal Adapter (MSTA) to improve the alignment between representations in the text and vision branches, achieving a balance between general knowledge and task-specific knowledge. Furthermore, to mitigate over-fitting and enhance generalizability, we introduce a spatio-temporal description-guided consistency constraint. This constraint involves feeding template inputs (i.e., ``a video of $\{\textbf{cls}\}$'') into the trainable language branch, while LLM-generated spatio-temporal descriptions are input into the pre-trained language branch, enforcing consistency between the outputs of the two branches. This mechanism prevents over-fitting to downstream tasks and improves the distinguishability of the trainable branch within the spatio-temporal semantic space. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach across four tasks: zero-shot transfer, few-shot learning, base-to-novel generalization, and fully-supervised learning. Compared to many state-of-the-art methods, our MSTA achieves outstanding performance across all evaluations, while using only 2-7\% of the trainable parameters in the original model. Code will be avaliable at https://github.com/chenhaoxing/ETL4Video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Fine-Tuning of Single-Cell Foundation Models Enables Zero-Shot Molecular Perturbation Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13478v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting transcriptional responses to novel drugs provides a unique opportunity to accelerate biomedical research and advance drug discovery efforts. However, the inherent complexity and high dimensionality of cellular responses, combined with the extremely limited available experimental data, makes the task challenging. In this study, we leverage single-cell foundation models (FMs) pre-trained on tens of millions of single cells, encompassing multiple cell types, states, and disease annotations, to address molecular perturbation prediction. We introduce a drug-conditional adapter that allows efficient fine-tuning by training less than 1% of the original foundation model, thus enabling molecular conditioning while preserving the rich biological representation learned during pre-training. The proposed strategy allows not only the prediction of cellular responses to novel drugs, but also the zero-shot generalization to unseen cell lines. We establish a robust evaluation framework to assess model performance across different generalization tasks, demonstrating state-of-the-art results across all settings, with significant improvements in the few-shot and zero-shot generalization to new cell lines compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

To achieve high reliability and scalability in deploying these agent services, it is essential to collaboratively optimize computational and communication resources, thereby ensuring effective resource allocation and seamless service delivery. In pursuit of this vision, this paper proposes a unified framework aimed at providing a comprehensive survey on deploying FM-based agent services across heterogeneous devices, with the emphasis on the integration of model and resource optimization to establish a robust infrastructure for these services. Particularly, this paper begins with exploring various low-level optimization strategies during inference and studies approaches that enhance system scalability, such as parallelism techniques and resource scaling methods. The paper then discusses several prominent FMs and investigates research efforts focused on inference acceleration, including techniques such as model compression and token reduction. Moreover, the paper also investigates critical components for constructing agent services and highlights notable intelligent applications. Finally, the paper presents potential research directions for developing real-time agent services with high Quality of Service (QoS).</p></details> |  |

OCTCube-M first developed OCTCube, a 3D foundation model pre-trained on 26,685 3D OCT volumes encompassing 1.62 million 2D OCT images. It then exploits a novel multi-modal contrastive learning framework COEP to integrate other retinal imaging modalities, such as fundus autofluorescence and infrared retinal imaging, into OCTCube, efficiently extending it into multi-modal foundation models. OCTCube achieves best performance on predicting 8 retinal diseases, demonstrating strong generalizability on cross-cohort, cross-device and cross-modality prediction. OCTCube can also predict cross-organ nodule malignancy (CT) and low cardiac ejection fraction as well as systemic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension, revealing its wide applicability beyond retinal diseases. We further develop OCTCube-IR using COEP with 26,685 OCT and IR image pairs. OCTCube-IR can accurately retrieve between OCT and IR images, allowing joint analysis between 3D and 2D retinal imaging modalities. Finally, we trained a tri-modal foundation model OCTCube-EF from 4 million 2D OCT images and 400K en face retinal images. OCTCube-EF attains the best performance on predicting the growth rate of geographic atrophy (GA) across datasets collected from 6 multi-center global trials conducted in 23 countries. This improvement is statistically equivalent to running a clinical trial with more than double the size of the original study. Our analysis based on another retrospective case study reveals OCTCube-EF's ability to avoid false positive Phase-III results according to its accurate treatment effect estimation on the Phase-II results. In sum, OCTCube-M is a 3D multi-modal foundation model framework that integrates OCT and other retinal imaging modalities revealing substantial diagnostic and prognostic benefits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proposer-Agent-Evaluator(PAE): Autonomous Skill Discovery For Foundation Model Internet Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13194v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vision of a broadly capable and goal-directed agent, such as an Internet-browsing agent in the digital world and a household humanoid in the physical world, has rapidly advanced, thanks to the generalization capability of foundation models. Such a generalist agent needs to have a large and diverse skill repertoire, such as finding directions between two travel locations and buying specific items from the Internet. If each skill needs to be specified manually through a fixed set of human-annotated instructions, the agent's skill repertoire will necessarily be limited due to the quantity and diversity of human-annotated instructions. In this work, we address this challenge by proposing Proposer-Agent-Evaluator, an effective learning system that enables foundation model agents to autonomously discover and practice skills in the wild. At the heart of PAE is a context-aware task proposer that autonomously proposes tasks for the agent to practice with context information of the environment such as user demos or even just the name of the website itself for Internet-browsing agents. Then, the agent policy attempts those tasks with thoughts and actual grounded operations in the real world with resulting trajectories evaluated by an autonomous VLM-based success evaluator. The success evaluation serves as the reward signal for the agent to refine its policies through RL. We validate PAE on challenging vision-based web navigation, using both real-world and self-hosted websites from WebVoyager and WebArena.To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first effective learning system to apply autonomous task proposal with RL for agents that generalizes real-world human-annotated benchmarks with SOTA performances. Our open-source checkpoints and code can be found in https://yanqval.github.io/PAE/</p></details> |  |

However, prevalent approaches primarily rely on extensive labeled data and computationally intensive voxel-based modeling, restricting the scalability and generalizability of 3D representation learning. In this paper, we introduce GaussTR, a novel Gaussian Transformer that leverages alignment with foundation models to advance self-supervised 3D spatial understanding. GaussTR adopts a Transformer architecture to predict sparse sets of 3D Gaussians that represent scenes in a feed-forward manner. Through aligning rendered Gaussian features with diverse knowledge from pre-trained foundation models, GaussTR facilitates the learning of versatile 3D representations and enables open-vocabulary occupancy prediction without explicit annotations. Empirical evaluations on the Occ3D-nuScenes dataset showcase GaussTR's state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, achieving 11.70 mIoU while reducing training duration by approximately 50%. These experimental results highlight the significant potential of GaussTR for scalable and holistic 3D spatial understanding, with promising implications for autonomous driving and embodied agents.

The learnable distance measure captures motif similarity and domain-specific semantic information such as rotation invariance. The learned distance provides a measurement of semantic similarity between a pair of accelerometer time-series segments, which is used to measure the distance between an anchor and various other sampled candidate segments. The self-supervised model is trained on 1 billion segments from 87,376 participants from a large wearables dataset. The model achieves strong performance across multiple downstream tasks, encompassing both classification and regression. To our knowledge, we are the first to show the generalizability of a self-supervised learning model with motion data from wearables across distinct evaluation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Knowledge-enhanced Pathology Vision-language Foundation Model for Cancer Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13126v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has enabled the development of highly robust foundation models for various pathological tasks across diverse diseases and patient cohorts. Among these models, vision-language pre-training, which leverages large-scale paired data to align pathology image and text embedding spaces, and provides a novel zero-shot paradigm for downstream tasks. However, existing models have been primarily data-driven and lack the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, which limits their performance in cancer diagnosis, especially for rare tumor subtypes. To address this limitation, we establish a Knowledge-enhanced Pathology (KEEP) foundation model that harnesses disease knowledge to facilitate vision-language pre-training. Specifically, we first construct a disease knowledge graph (KG) that covers 11,454 human diseases with 139,143 disease attributes, including synonyms, definitions, and hypernym relations. We then systematically reorganize the millions of publicly available noisy pathology image-text pairs, into 143K well-structured semantic groups linked through the hierarchical relations of the disease KG. To derive more nuanced image and text representations, we propose a novel knowledge-enhanced vision-language pre-training approach that integrates disease knowledge into the alignment within hierarchical semantic groups instead of unstructured image-text pairs.

| **[On Foundation Models for Dynamical Systems from Purely Synthetic Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00395v2)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable generalization, data efficiency, and robustness properties across various domains. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of foundation models for applications in the control domain. The success of these models is enabled by large-scale pretaining on Internet-scale datasets. These are available in fields like natural language processing and computer vision, but do not exist for dynamical systems. We address this challenge by pretraining a transformer-based foundation model exclusively on synthetic data and propose to sample dynamics functions from a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Our pretrained model generalizes for prediction tasks across different dynamical systems, which we validate in simulation and hardware experiments, including cart-pole and Furuta pendulum setups. Additionally, the model can be fine-tuned effectively to new systems to increase performance even further. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of foundation models for dynamical systems that outperform specialist models in terms of generalization, data efficiency, and robustness.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In this study, we evaluate the zero-shot prediction capabilities of five Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs)-a new approach for STLP where models perform predictions without task-specific training-against two classical models, Gaussian Process (GP) and Support Vector Regression (SVR), which are trained on task-specific datasets. Our findings indicate that even without training, TSFMs like Chronos, TimesFM, and TimeGPT can surpass the performance of GP and SVR. This finding highlights the potential of TSFMs in STLP.</p></details> |  |

In this proposal, we demonstrate that indeed ChatGPT can assist in data cleaning by suggesting corrections for specific cells in a data table (scenario 1). However, ChatGPT may struggle with datasets it has never encountered before (e.g., local enterprise data) or when the user requires an explanation of the source of the suggested clean values. To address these issues, we developed a retrieval-based method that complements ChatGPT's power with a user-provided data lake. The data lake is first indexed, we then retrieve the top-k relevant tuples to the user's query tuple and finally leverage ChatGPT to infer the correct value (scenario 2). Nevertheless, sharing enterprise data with ChatGPT, an externally hosted model, might not be feasible for privacy reasons. To assist with this scenario, we developed a custom RoBERTa-based foundation model that can be locally deployed. By fine-tuning it on a small number of examples, it can effectively make value inferences based on the retrieved tuples (scenario 3). Our proposed system, RetClean, seamlessly supports all three scenarios and provides a user-friendly GUI that enables the VLDB audience to explore and experiment with the system.</p></details> |  |

However, automating LULC map generation using machine learning is rendered challenging due to noisy labels. Typically, the ground truths (e.g. ESRI LULC, MapBioMass) have noisy labels that hamper the model's ability to learn to accurately classify the pixels. Further, these erroneous labels can significantly distort the performance metrics of a model, leading to misleading evaluations. Traditionally, the ambiguous labels are rectified using unsupervised algorithms. These algorithms struggle not only with scalability but also with generalization across different geographies. To overcome these challenges, we propose a zero-shot approach using the foundation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to automatically delineate different land parcels/regions and leverage them to relabel the unsure pixels by using the local label statistics within each detected region. We achieve a significant reduction in label noise and an improvement in the performance of the downstream segmentation model by $\approx 5\%$ when trained with denoised labels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferable and Forecastable User Targeting Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12468v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User targeting, the process of selecting targeted users from a pool of candidates for non-expert marketers, has garnered substantial attention with the advancements in digital marketing. However, existing user targeting methods encounter two significant challenges: (i) Poor cross-domain and cross-scenario transferability and generalization, and (ii) Insufficient forecastability in real-world applications. These limitations hinder their applicability across diverse industrial scenarios. In this work, we propose FIND, an industrial-grade, transferable, and forecastable user targeting foundation model. To enhance cross-domain transferability, our framework integrates heterogeneous multi-scenario user data, aligning them with one-sentence targeting demand inputs through contrastive pre-training. For improved forecastability, the text description of each user is derived based on anticipated future behaviors, while user representations are constructed from historical information. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing baselines in cross-domain, real-world user targeting scenarios, showcasing the superior capabilities of FIND. Moreover, our method has been successfully deployed on the Alipay platform and is widely utilized across various scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Previous works on interpretability for machine learning models on pathology images have revolved around methods such as attention value visualization and deriving human-interpretable features from model heatmaps. Mechanistic interpretability is an emerging area of model interpretability that focuses on reverse-engineering neural networks. Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising direction in terms of extracting monosemantic features from polysemantic model activations. In this work, we trained a Sparse Autoencoder on the embeddings of a pathology pretrained foundation model. We found that Sparse Autoencoder features represent interpretable and monosemantic biological concepts. In particular, individual SAE dimensions showed strong correlations with cell type counts such as plasma cells and lymphocytes. These biological representations were unique to the pathology pretrained model and were not found in a self-supervised model pretrained on natural images. We demonstrated that such biologically-grounded monosemantic representations evolved across the model's depth, and the pathology foundation model eventually gained robustness to non-biological factors such as scanner type. The emergence of biologically relevant SAE features was generalizable to an out-of-domain dataset. Our work paves the way for further exploration around interpretable feature dimensions and their utility for medical and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Previous research has primarily focused on separately training patch-level and whole-slide image (WSI)-level models, limiting the integration of learned knowledge across patches and WSIs, and resulting in redundant models. In this work, we introduce CPath-Omni, the first 15-billion-parameter LMM designed to unify both patch and WSI level image analysis, consolidating a variety of tasks at both levels, including classification, visual question answering, captioning, and visual referring prompting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CPath-Omni achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across seven diverse tasks on 39 out of 42 datasets, outperforming or matching task-specific models trained for individual tasks. Additionally, we develop a specialized pathology CLIP-based visual processor for CPath-Omni, CPath-CLIP, which, for the first time, integrates different vision models and incorporates a large language model as a text encoder to build a more powerful CLIP model, which achieves SOTA performance on nine zero-shot and four few-shot datasets. Our findings highlight CPath-Omni's ability to unify diverse pathology tasks, demonstrating its potential to streamline and advance the field of foundation model in pathology.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

We make the first attempt and propose a self-supervised pretraining framework to learn fundamental representations of real face images, FSFM, that leverages the synergy between masked image modeling (MIM) and instance discrimination (ID). We explore various facial masking strategies for MIM and present a simple yet powerful CRFR-P masking, which explicitly forces the model to capture meaningful intra-region consistency and challenging inter-region coherency. Furthermore, we devise the ID network that naturally couples with MIM to establish underlying local-to-global correspondence via tailored self-distillation. These three learning objectives, namely 3C, empower encoding both local features and global semantics of real faces. After pretraining, a vanilla ViT serves as a universal vision foundation model for downstream face security tasks: cross-dataset deepfake detection, cross-domain face anti-spoofing, and unseen diffusion facial forgery detection. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets demonstrate that our model transfers better than supervised pretraining, visual and facial self-supervised learning arts, and even outperforms task-specialized SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures, project page: https://fsfm-3c.github.io</p></details> |

To reduce the costs of these essential controls, this paper investigates the use of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) to automate the validation process, examining for the first time the cost/quality trade-off in data acquisition. Experiments conducted on French, German, and Korean data demonstrate that SFM-based validation has the potential to reduce reliance on human validation, resulting in an estimated cost saving of over 40.0% without degrading final data quality. These findings open new opportunities for more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable speech data acquisition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at COLING 2025 main conference</p></details> |

However, the invariance of these representations to patch rotation remains unexplored. This study investigates the rotational invariance of latent representations across twelve foundation models by quantifying the alignment between non-rotated and rotated patches using mutual $k$-nearest neighbours and cosine distance. Models that incorporated rotation augmentation during self-supervised training exhibited significantly greater invariance to rotations. We hypothesise that the absence of rotational inductive bias in the transformer architecture necessitates rotation augmentation during training to achieve learned invariance.

However, such solutions are not yet available for Tetun, making it challenging to find relevant documents for text-based search queries in this language. To address these challenges, this study investigates Tetun text retrieval with a focus on the ad-hoc retrieval task. It begins by developing essential language resources -- including a list of stopwords, a stemmer, and a test collection -- which serve as foundational components for solutions tailored to Tetun text retrieval. Various strategies are then explored using both document titles and content to evaluate retrieval effectiveness. The results show that retrieving document titles, after removing hyphens and apostrophes without applying stemming, significantly improves retrieval performance compared to the baseline. Efficiency increases by 31.37%, while effectiveness achieves an average gain of 9.40% in MAP@10 and 30.35% in nDCG@10 with DFR BM25. Beyond the top-10 cutoff point, Hiemstra LM demonstrates strong performance across various retrieval strategies and evaluation metrics. Contributions of this work include the development of Labadain-Stopwords (a list of 160 Tetun stopwords), Labadain-Stemmer (a Tetun stemmer with three variants), and Labadain-Avaliad\'or (a Tetun test collection containing 59 topics, 33,550 documents, and 5,900 qrels).</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Foundation Model-Agnostic Slide-Level Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13623v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representation learning of pathology whole-slide images(WSIs) has primarily relied on weak supervision with Multiple Instance Learning (MIL). This approach leads to slide representations highly tailored to a specific clinical task. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has been successfully applied to train histopathology foundation models (FMs) for patch embedding generation. However, generating patient or slide level embeddings remains challenging. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from patch level learning to entire slides by aligning different augmentations of the slide or by utilizing multimodal data. By integrating tile embeddings from multiple FMs, we propose a new single modality SSL method in feature space that generates useful slide representations. Our contrastive pretraining strategy, called COBRA, employs multiple FMs and an architecture based on Mamba-2. COBRA exceeds performance of state-of-the-art slide encoders on four different public Clinical Protemic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) cohorts on average by at least +4.5% AUC, despite only being pretrained on 3048 WSIs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Additionally, COBRA is readily compatible at inference time with previously unseen feature extractors. Code available at https://github.com/KatherLab/COBRA.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking Foundation Models Against End-to-End Training for Mitotic Figure Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06365v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs), i.e., models trained on a vast amount of typically unlabeled data, have become popular and available recently for the domain of histopathology. The key idea is to extract semantically rich vectors from any input patch, allowing for the use of simple subsequent classification networks potentially reducing the required amounts of labeled data, and increasing domain robustness. In this work, we investigate to which degree this also holds for mitotic figure classification. Utilizing two popular public mitotic figure datasets, we compared linear probing of five publicly available FMs against models trained on ImageNet and a simple ResNet50 end-to-end-trained baseline. We found that the end-to-end-trained baseline outperformed all FM-based classifiers, regardless of the amount of data provided. Additionally, we did not observe the FM-based classifiers to be more robust against domain shifts, rendering both of the above assumptions incorrect.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

However, most traditional deep learning predictors rely solely on unimodal numerical data, using a fixed-length window for training and prediction on a single dataset, and cannot adapt to different scenarios. The powered pre-trained large language model has introduced new opportunities for time series analysis. Yet, existing methods are either inefficient in training, incapable of handling textual information, or lack zero-shot forecasting capability. In this paper, we innovatively model time series as a foreign language and construct ChatTime, a unified framework for time series and text processing. As an out-of-the-box multimodal time series foundation model, ChatTime provides zero-shot forecasting capability and supports bimodal input/output for both time series and text. We design a series of experiments to verify the superior performance of ChatTime across multiple tasks and scenarios, and create four multimodal datasets to address data gaps. The experimental results demonstrate the potential and utility of ChatTime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing models often struggle to detect gait bouts in individuals with neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) involving involuntary movements. We developed J-Net, a deep learning model inspired by U-Net, which uses a pre-trained self-supervised foundation model fine-tuned with Huntington`s disease (HD) in-lab data and paired with a segmentation head for gait detection. J-Net processes wrist-worn accelerometer data to detect gait during daily living. We evaluated J-Net on in-lab and daily-living data from HD, Parkinson`s disease (PD), and controls. J-Net achieved a 10-percentage point improvement in ROC-AUC for HD over existing methods, reaching 0.97 for in-lab data. In daily-living environments, J-Net estimates showed no significant differences in median daily walking time between HD and controls (p = 0.23), in contrast to other models, which indicated counterintuitive results (p < 0.005). Walking time measured by J-Net correlated with the UHDRS-TMS clinical severity score (r=-0.52; p=0.02), confirming its clinical relevance. Fine-tuning J-Net on PD data also improved gait detection over current methods. J-Net`s architecture effectively addresses the challenges of gait detection in severe chorea and offers robust performance in daily living. The dataset and J-Net model are publicly available, providing a resource for further research into NDD-related gait impairments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wearable Accelerometer Foundation Models for Health via Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11276v1)** | 2024-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern wearable devices can conveniently and continuously record various biosignals in the many different environments of daily living, ultimately enabling a rich view of individual health. However, not all biosignals are the same: high-fidelity measurements, such as photoplethysmography (PPG), contain more physiological information, but require optical sensors with a high power footprint. In a resource-constrained setting, such biosignals may be unavailable. Alternatively, a lower-fidelity biosignal, such as accelerometry that captures minute cardiovascular information during low-motion periods, has a significantly smaller power footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. Here, we demonstrate that we can distill representational knowledge across biosignals, i.e., from PPG to accelerometry, using 20 million minutes of unlabeled data, collected from ~172K participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study under informed consent. We first pre-train PPG encoders via self-supervised learning, and then distill their representational knowledge to accelerometry encoders. We demonstrate strong cross-modal alignment on unseen data, e.g., 99.2% top-1 accuracy for retrieving PPG embeddings from accelerometry embeddings. We show that distilled accelerometry encoders have significantly more informative representations compared to self-supervised or supervised encoders trained directly on accelerometry data, observed by at least 23%-49% improved performance for predicting heart rate and heart rate variability. We also show that distilled accelerometry encoders are readily predictive of a wide array of downstream health targets, i.e., they are generalist foundation models. We believe accelerometry foundation models for health may unlock new opportunities for developing digital biomarkers from any wearable device, and help individuals track their health more frequently and conveniently.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods usually employ neural radiance fields to produce voxelized 3D occupancy, lacking instance-level semantic reasoning and temporal photometric consistency. In this paper, we propose ViPOcc, which leverages the visual priors from vision foundation models (VFMs) for fine-grained 3D occupancy prediction. Unlike previous works that solely employ volume rendering for RGB and depth image reconstruction, we introduce a metric depth estimation branch, in which an inverse depth alignment module is proposed to bridge the domain gap in depth distribution between VFM predictions and the ground truth. The recovered metric depth is then utilized in temporal photometric alignment and spatial geometric alignment to ensure accurate and consistent 3D occupancy prediction. Additionally, we also propose a semantic-guided non-overlapping Gaussian mixture sampler for efficient, instance-aware ray sampling, which addresses the redundant and imbalanced sampling issue that still exists in previous state-of-the-art methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of ViPOcc in both 3D occupancy prediction and depth estimation tasks on the KITTI-360 and KITTI Raw datasets.

Leveraging the zero-shot capabilities of foundation models offers a promising solution to these challenges. In this paper, we introduce ZeroReg, a zero-shot registration approach that utilizes 2D foundation models to predict 3D correspondences. Specifically, ZeroReg adopts an object-to-point matching strategy, starting with object localization and semantic feature extraction from multi-view images using foundation models. In the object matching stage, semantic features help identify correspondences between objects across views. However, relying solely on semantic features can lead to ambiguity, especially in scenes with multiple instances of the same category. To address this, we construct scene graphs to capture spatial relationships among objects and apply a graph matching algorithm to these graphs to accurately identify matched objects. Finally, computing fine-grained point-level correspondences within matched object regions using algorithms like SuperGlue and LoFTR achieves robust point cloud registration. Evaluations on benchmarks such as 3DMatch, 3DLoMatch, and ScanNet demonstrate ZeroReg's competitive performance, highlighting its potential to advance point-cloud registration by integrating semantic features from foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has increasingly focused on the explicit extraction of 3D features, while still facing challenges such as the lack of large-scale robotic 3D data and the potential loss of spatial geometry. To address these limitations, we propose the Lift3D framework, which progressively enhances 2D foundation models with implicit and explicit 3D robotic representations to construct a robust 3D manipulation policy. Specifically, we first design a task-aware masked autoencoder that masks task-relevant affordance patches and reconstructs depth information, enhancing the 2D foundation model's implicit 3D robotic representation. After self-supervised fine-tuning, we introduce a 2D model-lifting strategy that establishes a positional mapping between the input 3D points and the positional embeddings of the 2D model. Based on the mapping, Lift3D utilizes the 2D foundation model to directly encode point cloud data, leveraging large-scale pretrained knowledge to construct explicit 3D robotic representations while minimizing spatial information loss. In experiments, Lift3D consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods across several simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present SMARTFEAT, an efficient automated feature engineering tool to assist data users, even non-experts, in constructing useful features. Leveraging the power of Foundation Models (FMs), our approach enables the creation of new features from the data, based on contextual information and open-world knowledge. Our method incorporates an intelligent operator selector that discerns a subset of operators, effectively avoiding exhaustive combinations of original features, as is typically observed in traditional automated feature engineering tools. Moreover, we address the limitations of performing data tasks through row-level interactions with FMs, which could lead to significant delays and costs due to excessive API calls. We introduce a function generator that facilitates the acquisition of efficient data transformations, such as dataframe built-in methods or lambda functions, ensuring the applicability of SMARTFEAT to generate new features for large datasets.

Existing FMs have struggled to establish sequence-structure alignment, hindering the free flow of genomic information between RNA sequences and structures. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, an RNA FM trained to align RNA sequences with respect to secondary structures based on structure-contextualised modelling. The alignment enables free and bidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the flexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output modalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate the Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2 benchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only solved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure alignment. We leverage four comprehensive in-silico genome modelling benchmarks to evaluate performance across a diverse set of genome downstream tasks, where the results show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on RNA and DNA benchmarks, even without any training on DNA genomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

While recent iterative optimization-based methods have achieved promising performance, their feature extraction capabilities still have room for improvement. Inspired by the ability of vision foundation models (VFMs) to extract general representations, in this work, we propose AIO-Stereo which can flexibly select and transfer knowledge from multiple heterogeneous VFMs to a single stereo matching model. To better reconcile features between heterogeneous VFMs and the stereo matching model and fully exploit prior knowledge from VFMs, we proposed a dual-level feature utilization mechanism that aligns heterogeneous features and transfers multi-level knowledge. Based on the mechanism, a dual-level selective knowledge transfer module is designed to selectively transfer knowledge and integrate the advantages of multiple VFMs. Experimental results show that AIO-Stereo achieves start-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets and ranks $1^{st}$ on the Middlebury dataset and outperforms all the published work on the ETH3D benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Models like ChatGPT are empowered by the concept of transfer learning and self-supervised learning, so they can be easily applied to the downstream tasks after fine-tuning or prompting. These models, so-called Foundation Models (FM), fouce on understanding the human's intent and perform following their designed roles in the specific tasks, which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and language domains. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations.

We begin by outlining the characteristics of THz UM-MIMO systems, and identify three primary challenges for the transceiver design: 'hard to compute', 'hard to model', and 'hard to measure'. We argue that AI can provide a promising solution to these challenges. We then propose two systematic research roadmaps for developing AI algorithms tailored for THz UM-MIMO systems. The first roadmap, called model-driven deep learning (DL), emphasizes the importance to leverage available domain knowledge and advocates for adopting AI only to enhance the bottleneck modules within an established signal processing or optimization framework. We discuss four essential steps to make it work, including algorithmic frameworks, basis algorithms, loss function design, and neural architecture design. Afterwards, we present a forward-looking vision through the second roadmap, i.e., physical layer foundation models. This approach seeks to unify the design of different transceiver modules by focusing on their common foundation, i.e., the wireless channel. We propose to train a single, compact foundation model to estimate the score function of wireless channels, which can serve as a versatile prior for designing a wide variety of transceiver modules. We will also guide the readers through four essential steps, including general frameworks, conditioning, site-specific adaptation, and the joint design of foundation models and model-driven DL.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, tutorial paper.

More recently, these workflows have been significantly augmented with the advent of large language models (LLMs) and systems of autonomous agents capable of utilizing pre-trained models to make predictions in the context of more complex research tasks. While effective, there is still room for substantial improvement within agentic systems on the retrieval of salient information for material design tasks. Within this context, alternative uses of predictive deep learning models, such as leveraging their latent representations to facilitate cross-modal retrieval augmented generation within agentic systems for task-specific materials design, has remained unexplored. Herein, we demonstrate that large, pre-trained chemistry foundation models can serve as a basis for enabling structure-focused, semantic chemistry information retrieval for both small-molecules, complex polymeric materials, and reactions. Additionally, we show the use of chemistry foundation models in conjunction with multi-modal models such as OpenCLIP facilitate unprecedented queries and information retrieval across multiple characterization data domains. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of these models within multi-agent systems to facilitate structure and topological-based natural language queries and information retrieval for different research tasks.</p></details> |  |

As a result, FM leaderboards have become essential tools for SE teams to compare and select the best third-party FMs for their specific products and purposes. However, the lack of standardized guidelines for FM evaluation and comparison threatens the transparency of FM leaderboards and limits stakeholders' ability to perform effective FM selection. As a first step towards addressing this challenge, our research focuses on understanding how these FM leaderboards operate in real-world scenarios ("leaderboard operations") and identifying potential pitfalls and areas for improvement ("leaderboard smells"). In this regard, we collect up to 1,045 FM leaderboards from five different sources: GitHub, Hugging Face Spaces, Papers With Code, spreadsheet and independent platform, to examine their documentation and engage in direct communication with leaderboard operators to understand their workflows. Through card sorting and negotiated agreement, we identify five distinct workflow patterns and develop a domain model that captures the key components and their interactions within these workflows. We then identify eight unique types of leaderboard smells in LBOps. By mitigating these smells, SE teams can improve transparency, accountability, and collaboration in current LBOps practices, fostering a more robust and responsible ecosystem for FM comparison and selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>aweso...</summary><p>awesome foundation model leaderboard list: https://github.com/SAILResearch/awesome-foundation-model-leaderboards</p></details> |

Wearable sensing data, on the other hand, contain more variability in both patterns and frequency bands of interest and generally emphasize more on the ability to infer healthcare-related outcomes. The main challenge of crafting a foundation model for wearable sensing physiological signals is to learn generalizable representations that support efficient adaptation across heterogeneous sensing configurations and applications. In this work, we propose NormWear, a step toward such a foundation model, aiming to extract generalized and informative wearable sensing representations. NormWear has been pretrained on a large set of physiological signals, including PPG, ECG, EEG, GSR, and IMU, from various public resources. For a holistic assessment, we perform downstream evaluation on 11 public wearable sensing datasets, spanning 18 applications in the areas of mental health, body state inference, biomarker estimations, and disease risk evaluations. We demonstrate that NormWear achieves a better performance improvement over competitive baselines in general time series foundation modeling. In addition, leveraging a novel representation-alignment-match-based method, we align physiological signals embeddings with text embeddings. This alignment enables our proposed foundation model to perform zero-shot inference, allowing it to generalize to previously unseen wearable signal-based health applications. Finally, we perform nonlinear dynamic analysis on the waveform features extracted by the model at each intermediate layer. This analysis quantifies the model's internal processes, offering clear insights into its behavior and fostering greater trust in its inferences among end users.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code is available at: http://github.com/Mobile-Sensing-and-UbiComp-Laboratory/NormWear</p></details> |

With the differences in architecture and training protocols (i.e., objectives, proxy tasks), a unified framework to fairly and comprehensively probe their 3D awareness is urgently needed. Existing works on 3D probing suggest single-view 2.5D estimation (e.g., depth and normal) or two-view sparse 2D correspondence (e.g., matching and tracking). Unfortunately, these tasks ignore texture awareness, and require 3D data as ground-truth, which limits the scale and diversity of their evaluation set. To address these issues, we introduce Feat2GS, which readout 3D Gaussians attributes from VFM features extracted from unposed images. This allows us to probe 3D awareness for geometry and texture via novel view synthesis, without requiring 3D data. Additionally, the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry ($\boldsymbol{x}, \alpha, \Sigma$) and texture ($\boldsymbol{c}$) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS, we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs, and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM. Building on these findings, we develop several variants that achieve state-of-the-art across diverse datasets. This makes Feat2GS useful for probing VFMs, and as a simple-yet-effective baseline for novel-view synthesis. Code and data will be made available at https://fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://fanegg.github.io/Feat2GS/</p></details> |
| **[Foundational Large Language Models for Materials Research](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09560v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Medical Foundation Model Features in Graph Neural Network-Based Retrieval of Breast Histopathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04211v3)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Breast cancer is the most common cancer type in women worldwide. Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly reduce its impact. While histopathology examinations play a vital role in rapid and accurate diagnosis, they often require experienced medical experts for proper recognition and cancer grading. Automated image retrieval systems have the potential to assist pathologists in identifying cancerous tissues, thereby accelerating the diagnostic process. Nevertheless, proposing an accurate image retrieval model is challenging due to considerable variability among the tissue and cell patterns in histological images. In this work, we leverage the features from foundation models in a novel attention-based adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder model for breast histological image retrieval. Our results confirm the superior performance of models trained with foundation model features compared to those using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (up to 7.7% and 15.5% for mAP and mMV, respectively), with the pre-trained general-purpose self-supervised model for computational pathology (UNI) delivering the best overall performance. By evaluating two publicly available histology image datasets of breast cancer, our top-performing model, trained with UNI features, achieved average mAP/mMV scores of 96.7%/91.5% and 97.6%/94.2% for the BreakHis and BACH datasets, respectively. Our proposed retrieval model has the potential to be used in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic performance and ultimately benefit patients.</p></details> | 29 pages |

However, existing AI4SI research is often labor-intensive and resource-demanding, limiting its accessibility and scalability; the standard approach is to design a (base-level) system tailored to a specific AI4SI problem. We propose the development of a novel meta-level multi-agent system designed to accelerate the development of such base-level systems, thereby reducing the computational cost and the burden on social impact domain experts and AI researchers. Leveraging advancements in foundation models and large language models, our proposed approach focuses on resource allocation problems providing help across the full AI4SI pipeline from problem formulation over solution design to impact evaluation. We highlight the ethical considerations and challenges inherent in deploying such systems and emphasize the importance of a human-in-the-loop approach to ensure the responsible and effective application of AI systems.</p></details> |  |

While counterfactual generation enables bias analysis, existing methods introduce artifacts by modifying contextual elements like clothing and background. We present a localized counterfactual generation method that preserves image context by constraining counterfactual modifications to specific attribute-relevant regions through automated masking and guided inpainting. When applied to the Conceptual Captions dataset for creating gender counterfactuals, our method results in higher visual and semantic fidelity than state-of-the-art alternatives, while maintaining the performance of models trained using only real data on non-human-centric tasks. Models fine-tuned with our counterfactuals demonstrate measurable bias reduction across multiple metrics, including a decrease in gender classification disparity and balanced person preference scores, while preserving ImageNet zero-shot performance. The results establish a framework for creating balanced datasets that enable both accurate bias profiling and effective mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Foundation Models on Heterogeneous Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08906v1)** | 2024-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a general-purpose time series foundation models with robust generalization capabilities across diverse applications from scratch is still an open challenge. Efforts are primarily focused on fusing cross-domain time series datasets to extract shared subsequences as tokens for training models on Transformer architecture. However, due to significant statistical heterogeneity across domains, this cross-domain fusing approach doesn't work effectively as the same as fusing texts and images. To tackle this challenge, this paper proposes a novel federated learning approach to address the heterogeneity in time series foundation models training, namely FFTS. Specifically, each data-holding organization is treated as an independent client in a collaborative learning framework with federated settings, and then many client-specific local models will be trained to preserve the unique characteristics per dataset. Moreover, a new regularization mechanism will be applied to both client-side and server-side, thus to align the shared knowledge across heterogeneous datasets from different domains. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed federated learning approach. The newly learned time series foundation models achieve superior generalization capabilities on cross-domain time series analysis tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Main Track in AAAI'25</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Adaptive Pre-training of Self-Supervised Foundation Models for Medical Image Classification in Gastrointestinal Endoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21302v4)** | 2024-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video capsule endoscopy has transformed gastrointestinal endoscopy (GIE) diagnostics by offering a non-invasive method for capturing detailed images of the gastrointestinal tract, enabling early disease detection. However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large GIE dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring patient integrity across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical image diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the ViT architecture and trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Our model demonstrates robust performance, securing third place in the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge. We achieved a macro AUC of 0.762 and a balanced accuracy of 37.1% on the test set. These results emphasize the effectiveness of our domain-adaptive pre-training approach and the enriched EndoExtend24 dataset in advancing gastrointestinal endoscopy diagnostics.</p></details> |  |

Existing outlier-aware algorithm/architecture co-design techniques either use mixed-precision, retaining outliers at high precision but compromise hardware efficiency, or quantize inliers and outliers at the same precision, improving hardware efficiency at the cost of accuracy. To address this mutual exclusivity, in this paper, we propose MicroScopiQ, a novel co-design technique that leverages pruning to complement outlier-aware quantization. MicroScopiQ retains outliers at higher precision while pruning a certain fraction of least important weights to distribute the additional outlier bits; ensuring high accuracy, aligned memory and hardware efficiency. We design a high-throughput, low overhead accelerator architecture composed of simple multi-precision INT processing elements and a novel network-on-chip called ReCoN that efficiently abstracts the complexity of supporting high-precision outliers. Additionally, unlike existing alternatives, MicroScopiQ does not assume any locality of outlier weights, enabling applicability to a broad range of FMs. Extensive experiments across various quantization settings show that MicroScopiQ achieves SoTA quantization performance while simultaneously improving inference performance by 3x and reducing energy by 2x over existing alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review</p></details> |

However, due to the high-dimensional nature of the problem space and scarcity of high-quality 3D data, these pre-trained models still struggle to generalize to many challenging circumstances, such as limited view overlap or low lighting. To address this, we propose LoRA3D, an efficient self-calibration pipeline to $\textit{specialize}$ the pre-trained models to target scenes using their own multi-view predictions. Taking sparse RGB images as input, we leverage robust optimization techniques to refine multi-view predictions and align them into a global coordinate frame. In particular, we incorporate prediction confidence into the geometric optimization process, automatically re-weighting the confidence to better reflect point estimation accuracy. We use the calibrated confidence to generate high-quality pseudo labels for the calibrating views and use low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the models on the pseudo-labeled data. Our method does not require any external priors or manual labels. It completes the self-calibration process on a $\textbf{single standard GPU within just 5 minutes}$. Each low-rank adapter requires only $\textbf{18MB}$ of storage. We evaluated our method on $\textbf{more than 160 scenes}$ from the Replica, TUM and Waymo Open datasets, achieving up to $\textbf{88% performance improvement}$ on 3D reconstruction, multi-view pose estimation and novel-view rendering.</p></details> |  |

This strategy enables the efficient creation of robust models, combining the strengths of individual teachers while significantly reducing computational and resource demands. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze state-of-the-art agglomerative models, identifying critical challenges including resolution mode shifts, teacher imbalance, idiosyncratic teacher artifacts, and an excessive number of output tokens. To address these issues, we propose several novel solutions: multi-resolution training, mosaic augmentation, and improved balancing of teacher loss functions. Specifically, in the context of Vision Language Models, we introduce a token compression technique to maintain high-resolution information within a fixed token count. We release our top-performing models, available in multiple scales (-B, -L, -H, and -g), alongside inference code and pretrained weights.</p></details> |  |

However, the general applicability of these encodings and their potential to serve as foundational representations for graphs remain uncertain. This paper investigates the fine-tuning efficiency, scalability with sample size, and generalization capability of learnable PSEs across diverse graph datasets. Specifically, we evaluate their potential as universal pre-trained models that can be easily adapted to new tasks with minimal fine-tuning and limited data. Furthermore, we assess the expressivity of the learned representations, particularly, when used to augment downstream GNNs. We demonstrate through extensive benchmarking and empirical analysis that PSEs generally enhance downstream models. However, some datasets may require specific PSE-augmentations to achieve optimal performance. Nevertheless, our findings highlight their significant potential to become integral components of future graph foundation models. We provide new insights into the strengths and limitations of PSEs, contributing to the broader discourse on foundation models in graph learning.</p></details> |  |

In this context, ensuring the quality attributes of foundation model-based systems is of paramount importance, and with a particular focus on the challenging issue of privacy due to the sensitive nature of the data and information involved. However, there is currently a lack of consensus regarding the comprehensive scope of both technical and non-technical issues that the privacy evaluation process should encompass. Additionally, there is uncertainty about which existing methods are best suited to effectively address these privacy concerns. In response to this challenge, this paper introduces a novel conceptual framework that integrates various responsible AI patterns from multiple perspectives, with the specific aim of safeguarding privacy.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability.

This paper presents the UniAudio system, which, unlike prior task-specific approaches, leverages LLM techniques to generate multiple types of audio (including speech, sounds, music, and singing) with given input conditions. UniAudio 1) first tokenizes all types of target audio along with other condition modalities, 2) concatenates source-target pair as a single sequence, and 3) performs next-token prediction using LLM. Also, a multi-scale Transformer model is proposed to handle the overly long sequences caused by the residual vector quantization based neural codec in tokenization. Training of UniAudio is scaled up to 165K hours of audio and 1B parameters, based on all generative tasks, aiming to obtain sufficient prior knowledge not only in the intrinsic properties of audio but also the inter-relationship between audio and other modalities. Therefore, the trained UniAudio model has the potential to become a foundation model for universal audio generation: it shows strong capability in all trained tasks and can seamlessly support new audio generation tasks after simple fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate that UniAudio achieves state-of-the-art or at least competitive results on most of the 11 tasks. Demo and code are released at https://github.com/yangdongchao/UniAudio</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art methods typically employ fully supervised approaches, necessitating a huge labeled dataset acquired through expensive LiDAR sensors and meticulous voxel-wise labeling by human annotators. The resource-intensive nature of this annotating process significantly hampers the application and scalability of these methods. We introduce a novel semi-supervised framework to alleviate the dependency on densely annotated data. Our approach leverages 2D foundation models to generate essential 3D scene geometric and semantic cues, facilitating a more efficient training process. Our framework exhibits notable properties: (1) Generalizability, applicable to various 3D semantic scene completion approaches, including 2D-3D lifting and 3D-2D transformer methods. (2) Effectiveness, as demonstrated through experiments on SemanticKITTI and NYUv2, wherein our method achieves up to 85% of the fully-supervised performance using only 10% labeled data. This approach not only reduces the cost and labor associated with data annotation but also demonstrates the potential for broader adoption in camera-based systems for 3D semantic occupancy prediction.</p></details> | Accepted at AAAI2025 |

Why is it important? Because at the core of medicine, pharmacy, public health, longevity, agriculture and food security, environmental protection, and clean energy, it is biology at work. Biology in the physical world is too complex to manipulate and always expensive and risky to tamper with. In this perspective, we layout an engineering viable approach to address this challenge by constructing an AI-Driven Digital Organism (AIDO), a system of integrated multiscale foundation models, in a modular, connectable, and holistic fashion to reflect biological scales, connectedness, and complexities. An AIDO opens up a safe, affordable and high-throughput alternative platform for predicting, simulating and programming biology at all levels from molecules to cells to individuals. We envision that an AIDO is poised to trigger a new wave of better-guided wet-lab experimentation and better-informed first-principle reasoning, which can eventually help us better decode and improve life.</p></details> |  |

Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoning capabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between these models and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understanding benchmark named UniQA-3D. UniQA-3D covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it. Our results show that VLMs generally perform poorly, while the specialized models are accurate but not robust, failing under geometric perturbations. In contrast, human vision continues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. We further demonstrate that neural networks align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms compared to classical computer vision methods, and Transformer-based networks such as ViT align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms than CNNs.

To assess the information gathering abilities of foundation models in interactive environments, we introduce a framework in which a model must determine the factors influencing a hidden reward function by iteratively reasoning about its previously gathered information and proposing its next exploratory action to maximize information gain at each step. We implement this framework in both a text-based environment, which offers a tightly controlled setting and enables high-throughput parameter sweeps, and in an embodied 3D environment, which requires addressing complexities of multi-modal interaction more relevant to real-world applications. We further investigate whether approaches such as self-correction and increased inference time improve information gathering efficiency. In a relatively simple task that requires identifying a single rewarding feature, we find that LLM's information gathering capability is close to optimal. However, when the model must identify a conjunction of rewarding features, performance is suboptimal. The hit in performance is due partly to the model translating task description to a policy and partly to the model's effectiveness in using its in-context memory. Performance is comparable in both text and 3D embodied environments, although imperfect visual object recognition reduces its accuracy in drawing conclusions from gathered information in the 3D embodied case. For single-feature-based rewards, we find that smaller models curiously perform better; for conjunction-based rewards, incorporating self correction into the model improves performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Pre-training Data Quality without Labels for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06368v1)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been a growing interest in time series foundation models that generalize across different downstream tasks. A key to strong foundation models is a diverse pre-training dataset, which is particularly challenging to collect for time series classification. In this work, we explore the performance of a contrastive-learning-based foundation model as a function of the data used for pre-training. We introduce contrastive accuracy, a new measure to evaluate the quality of the representation space learned by the foundation model. Our experiments reveal the positive correlation between the proposed measure and the accuracy of the model on a collection of downstream tasks. This suggests that the contrastive accuracy can serve as a criterion to search for time series datasets that can enhance the pre-training and improve thereby the foundation model's generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Interpretable Concepts: Unifying Causal Representation Learning and Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09236v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To build intelligent machine learning systems, there are two broad approaches. One approach is to build inherently interpretable models, as endeavored by the growing field of causal representation learning. The other approach is to build highly-performant foundation models and then invest efforts into understanding how they work. In this work, we relate these two approaches and study how to learn human-interpretable concepts from data. Weaving together ideas from both fields, we formally define a notion of concepts and show that they can be provably recovered from diverse data. Experiments on synthetic data and large language models show the utility of our unified approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in NeurIPS 2024 under the modified title 'From Causal to Concept-Based Representation Learning'</p></details> |
| **[WeatherGFM: Learning A Weather Generalist Foundation Model via In-context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05420v2)** | 2024-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Earth's weather system encompasses intricate weather data modalities and diverse weather understanding tasks, which hold significant value to human life. Existing data-driven models focus on single weather understanding tasks (e.g., weather forecasting). Although these models have achieved promising results, they fail to tackle various complex tasks within a single and unified model. Moreover, the paradigm that relies on limited real observations for a single scenario hinders the model's performance upper bound. In response to these limitations, we draw inspiration from the in-context learning paradigm employed in state-of-the-art visual foundation models and large language models. In this paper, we introduce the first generalist weather foundation model (WeatherGFM), designed to address a wide spectrum of weather understanding tasks in a unified manner. More specifically, we initially unify the representation and definition of the diverse weather understanding tasks. Subsequently, we devised weather prompt formats to manage different weather data modalities, namely single, multiple, and temporal modalities. Finally, we adopt a visual prompting question-answering paradigm for the training of unified weather understanding tasks. Extensive experiments indicate that our WeatherGFM can effectively handle up to ten weather understanding tasks, including weather forecasting, super-resolution, weather image translation, and post-processing. Our method also showcases generalization ability on unseen tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking foundation models as feature extractors for weakly-supervised computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15823v2)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in artificial intelligence have driven the development of numerous pathology foundation models capable of extracting clinically relevant information. However, there is currently limited literature independently evaluating these foundation models on truly external cohorts and clinically-relevant tasks to uncover adjustments for future improvements. In this study, we benchmarked 19 histopathology foundation models on 13 patient cohorts with 6,818 patients and 9,528 slides from lung, colorectal, gastric, and breast cancers. The models were evaluated on weakly-supervised tasks related to biomarkers, morphological properties, and prognostic outcomes. We show that a vision-language foundation model, CONCH, yielded the highest performance when compared to vision-only foundation models, with Virchow2 as close second. The experiments reveal that foundation models trained on distinct cohorts learn complementary features to predict the same label, and can be fused to outperform the current state of the art. An ensemble combining CONCH and Virchow2 predictions outperformed individual models in 55% of tasks, leveraging their complementary strengths in classification scenarios. Moreover, our findings suggest that data diversity outweighs data volume for foundation models. Our work highlights actionable adjustments to improve pathology foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are foundation models for computer vision good conformal predictors?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06082v1)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervision and constrastive learning have brought the performance of foundation models to unprecedented levels in a variety of tasks. Fueled by this progress, these models are becoming the prevailing approach for a wide array of real-world vision problems, including risk-sensitive and high-stakes applications. However, ensuring safe deployment in these scenarios requires a more comprehensive understanding of their uncertainty modeling capabilities, which has been barely explored. In this work, we delve into the behavior of vision and vision-language foundation models under Conformal Prediction (CP), a statistical framework that provides theoretical guarantees of marginal coverage of the true class. Across extensive experiments including popular vision classification benchmarks, well-known foundation vision models, and three CP methods, our findings reveal that foundation models are well-suited for conformalization procedures, particularly those integrating Vision Transformers. Furthermore, we show that calibrating the confidence predictions of these models leads to efficiency degradation of the conformal set on adaptive CP methods. In contrast, few-shot adaptation to downstream tasks generally enhances conformal scores, where we identify Adapters as a better conformable alternative compared to Prompt Learning strategies. Our empirical study identifies APS as particularly promising in the context of vision foundation models, as it does not violate the marginal coverage property across multiple challenging, yet realistic scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15731v3)** | 2024-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
