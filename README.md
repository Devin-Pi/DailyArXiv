| **[GeoRSMLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model for Vision-Language Tasks in Geoscience and Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12490v1)** | 2025-03-16 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2503.12490v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in remote sensing (RS) has demonstrated significant potential in traditional tasks such as scene classification, object detection, and image captioning. However, current models, which excel in Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), struggle with tasks involving complex instructions (e.g., exists multiple conditions) or pixel-level operations like segmentation and change detection. In this white paper, we provide a comprehensive hierarchical summary of vision-language tasks in RS, categorized by the varying levels of cognitive capability required. We introduce the Remote Sensing Vision-Language Task Set (RSVLTS), which includes Open-Vocabulary Tasks (OVT), Referring Expression Tasks (RET), and Described Object Tasks (DOT) with increased difficulty, and Visual Question Answering (VQA) aloneside. Moreover, we propose a novel unified data representation using a set-of-points approach for RSVLTS, along with a condition parser and a self-augmentation strategy based on cyclic referring. These features are integrated into the GeoRSMLLM model, and this enhanced model is designed to handle a broad range of tasks of RSVLTS, paving the way for a more generalized solution for vision-language tasks in geoscience and remote sensing.</p></details> |  |

This success has led to the development of geoscience foundation models (FMs), which promise to accomplish multiple tasks within a workflow or replace the workflow altogether. However, lack of robust evaluation frameworks, even for traditional DLMs, leaves the geoscience community ill prepared for the inevitable adoption of FMs. We address this gap by designing an evaluation framework that jointly incorporates three crucial aspects to current DLMs and future FMs: performance uncertainty, learning efficiency, and overlapping training-test data splits. To target the three aspects, we meticulously construct the training, validation, and test splits using clustering methods tailored to geoscience data and enact an expansive training design to segregate performance uncertainty arising from stochastic training processes and random data sampling. The framework's ability to guard against misleading declarations of model superiority is demonstrated through evaluation of PhaseNet, a popular seismic phase picking DLM, under 3 training approaches. Furthermore, we show how the performance gains due to overlapping training-test data can lead to biased FM evaluation. Our framework helps practitioners choose the best model for their problem and set performance expectations by explicitly analyzing model performance at varying budgets of training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Foundation Models: Towards General Geoscience Artificial Intelligence System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06799v5)** | 2024-11-12 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2309.06799v5) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly advanced Earth sciences, yet its full potential in to comprehensively modeling Earth's complex dynamics remains unrealized. Geoscience foundation models (GFMs) emerge as a paradigm-shifting solution, integrating extensive cross-disciplinary data to enhance the simulation and understanding of Earth system dynamics. These data-centric AI models extract insights from petabytes of structured and unstructured data, effectively addressing the complexities of Earth systems that traditional models struggle to capture. The unique strengths of GFMs include flexible task specification, diverse input-output capabilities, and multi-modal knowledge representation, enabling analyses that surpass those of individual data sources or traditional AI methods. This review not only highlights the key advantages of GFMs, but also presents essential techniques for their construction, with a focus on transformers, pre-training, and adaptation strategies. Subsequently, we examine recent advancements in GFMs, including large language models, vision models, and vision-language models, particularly emphasizing the potential applications in remote sensing. Additionally, the review concludes with a comprehensive analysis of the challenges and future trends in GFMs, addressing five critical aspects: data integration, model complexity, uncertainty quantification, interdisciplinary collaboration, and concerns related to privacy, trust, and security. This review offers a comprehensive overview of emerging geoscientific research paradigms, emphasizing the untapped opportunities at the intersection of advanced AI techniques and geoscience. It examines major methodologies, showcases advances in large-scale models, and discusses the challenges and prospects that will shape the future landscape of GFMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>accpe...</summary><p>accpeted by IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Magazine</p></details> |

In this work, we discuss a series of developments in the field of prototype-based XAI that show potential for scientific learning tasks, with a focus on the geosciences. We organize the prototype-based XAI literature into three themes: the development and visualization of prototypes, types of prototypes, and the use of prototypes in various learning tasks. We discuss how the authors use prototype-based methods, their novel contributions, and any limitations or challenges that may arise when adapting these methods for geoscientific learning tasks. We highlight differences between geoscientific data sets and the standard benchmarks used to develop XAI methods, and discuss how specific geoscientific applications may benefit from using or modifying existing prototype-based XAI techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI for Science Workshop-Oral (Attention Track), Proceedings of 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Geoscience Artificial Intelligence (XGeoS-AI): Application to Demystify Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04940v2)** | 2024-05-07 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2311.04940v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Earth science enters the era of big data, artificial intelligence (AI) not only offers great potential for solving geoscience problems, but also plays a critical role in accelerating the understanding of the complex, interactive, and multiscale processes of Earth's behavior. As geoscience AI models are progressively utilized for significant predictions in crucial situations, geoscience researchers are increasingly demanding their interpretability and versatility. This study proposes an interpretable geoscience artificial intelligence (XGeoS-AI) framework to unravel the mystery of image recognition in the Earth sciences, and its effectiveness and versatility is demonstrated by taking computed tomography (CT) image recognition as an example. Inspired by the mechanism of human vision, the proposed XGeoS-AI framework generates a threshold value from a local region within the whole image to complete the recognition. Different kinds of artificial intelligence (AI) methods, such as Support Vector Regression (SVR), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), can be adopted as the AI engines of the proposed XGeoS-AI framework to efficiently complete geoscience image recognition tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that the effectiveness, versatility, and heuristics of the proposed framework have great potential in solving geoscience image recognition problems. Interpretable AI should receive more and more attention in the field of the Earth sciences, which is the key to promoting more rational and wider applications of AI in the field of Earth sciences. In addition, the proposed interpretable framework may be the forerunner of technological innovation in the Earth sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>there...</summary><p>there are some erros in the results, and a newer revision is still preparing</p></details> |
| **[GeoGalactica: A Scientific Large Language Model in Geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00434v2)** | 2024-04-13 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2401.00434v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved huge success for their general knowledge and ability to solve a wide spectrum of tasks in natural language processing (NLP). Due to their impressive abilities, LLMs have shed light on potential inter-discipline applications to foster scientific discoveries of a specific domain by using artificial intelligence (AI for science, AI4S). In the meantime, utilizing NLP techniques in geoscience research and practice is wide and convoluted, contributing from knowledge extraction and document classification to question answering and knowledge discovery. In this work, we take the initial step to leverage LLM for science, through a rather straightforward approach. We try to specialize an LLM into geoscience, by further pre-training the model with a vast amount of texts in geoscience, as well as supervised fine-tuning (SFT) the resulting model with our custom collected instruction tuning dataset. These efforts result in a model GeoGalactica consisting of 30 billion parameters. To our best knowledge, it is the largest language model for the geoscience domain. More specifically, GeoGalactica is from further pre-training of Galactica. We train GeoGalactica over a geoscience-related text corpus containing 65 billion tokens, preserving as the largest geoscience-specific text corpus. Then we fine-tune the model with 1 million pairs of instruction-tuning data consisting of questions that demand professional geoscience knowledge to answer. In this technical report, we will illustrate in detail all aspects of GeoGalactica, including data collection, data cleaning, base model selection, pre-training, SFT, and evaluation. We open-source our data curation tools and the checkpoints of GeoGalactica during the first 3/4 of pre-training.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel approach for estimating functions in the multivariate setting based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines with an application to a chemical system used in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00686v3)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2306.00686v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we will outline a novel data-driven method for estimating functions in a multivariate nonparametric regression model based on an adaptive knot selection for B-splines. The underlying idea of our approach for selecting knots is to apply the generalized lasso, since the knots of the B-spline basis can be seen as changes in the derivatives of the function to be estimated. This method was then extended to functions depending on several variables by processing each dimension independently, thus reducing the problem to a univariate setting. The regularization parameters were chosen by means of a criterion based on EBIC. The nonparametric estimator was obtained using a multivariate B-spline regression with the corresponding selected knots. Our procedure was validated through numerical experiments by varying the number of observations and the level of noise to investigate its robustness. The influence of observation sampling was also assessed and our method was applied to a chemical system commonly used in geoscience. For each different framework considered in this paper, our approach performed better than state-of-the-art methods. Our completely data-driven method is implemented in the glober R package which is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).</p></details> | 29 pages, 27 figures |
| **[When Geoscience Meets Generative AI and Large Language Models: Foundations, Trends, and Future Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03349v1)** | 2024-01-25 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2402.03349v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) represents an emerging field that promises the creation of synthetic data and outputs in different modalities. GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models that have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks (GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience community in several applications, including (but not limited to) data generation/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze removal, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain such as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and trustworthiness. Beyond that, GAI models show promises to the geoscience community, especially with the support to climate change, urban science, atmospheric science, marine science, and planetary science through their extraordinary ability to data-driven modeling and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable modeling to unify machine learning and physical models and advance Geosciences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04027v2)** | 2023-12-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2301.04027v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Process-Based Modeling (PBM) and Machine Learning (ML) are often perceived as distinct paradigms in the geosciences. Here we present differentiable geoscientific modeling as a powerful pathway toward dissolving the perceived barrier between them and ushering in a paradigm shift. For decades, PBM offered benefits in interpretability and physical consistency but struggled to efficiently leverage large datasets. ML methods, especially deep networks, presented strong predictive skills yet lacked the ability to answer specific scientific questions. While various methods have been proposed for ML-physics integration, an important underlying theme -- differentiable modeling -- is not sufficiently recognized. Here we outline the concepts, applicability, and significance of differentiable geoscientific modeling (DG). "Differentiable" refers to accurately and efficiently calculating gradients with respect to model variables, critically enabling the learning of high-dimensional unknown relationships. DG refers to a range of methods connecting varying amounts of prior knowledge to neural networks and training them together, capturing a different scope than physics-guided machine learning and emphasizing first principles. Preliminary evidence suggests DG offers better interpretability and causality than ML, improved generalizability and extrapolation capability, and strong potential for knowledge discovery, while approaching the performance of purely data-driven ML. DG models require less training data while scaling favorably in performance and efficiency with increasing amounts of data. With DG, geoscientists may be better able to frame and investigate questions, test hypotheses, and discover unrecognized linkages.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we bring LLMs to the realm of geoscience with the objective of advancing research and applications in this field. To this end, we present the first-ever LLM in geoscience, K2, alongside a suite of resources developed to further promote LLM research within geoscience. For instance, we have curated the first geoscience instruction tuning dataset, GeoSignal, which aims to align LLM responses to geoscience-related user queries. Additionally, we have established the first geoscience benchmark, GeoBench, to evaluate LLMs in the context of geoscience. In this work, we experiment with a complete recipe to adapt a pre-trained general-domain LLM to the geoscience domain. Specifically, we further train the LLaMA-7B model on 5.5B tokens of geoscience text corpus, including over 1 million pieces of geoscience literature, and utilize GeoSignal's supervised data to fine-tune the model. Moreover, we share a protocol that can efficiently gather domain-specific data and construct domain-supervised data, even in situations where manpower is scarce. Meanwhile, we equip K2 with the abilities of using tools to be a naive geoscience aide. Experiments conducted on the GeoBench demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and datasets on geoscience knowledge understanding and utilization.We open-source all the training data and K2 model checkpoints at https://github.com/davendw49/k2.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Security for Geoscience and Remote Sensing: Challenges and Future Trends](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09360v2)** | 2023-06-22 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2212.09360v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly intensified research in the geoscience and remote sensing (RS) field. AI algorithms, especially deep learning-based ones, have been developed and applied widely to RS data analysis. The successful application of AI covers almost all aspects of Earth observation (EO) missions, from low-level vision tasks like super-resolution, denoising and inpainting, to high-level vision tasks like scene classification, object detection and semantic segmentation. While AI techniques enable researchers to observe and understand the Earth more accurately, the vulnerability and uncertainty of AI models deserve further attention, considering that many geoscience and RS tasks are highly safety-critical. This paper reviews the current development of AI security in the geoscience and RS field, covering the following five important aspects: adversarial attack, backdoor attack, federated learning, uncertainty and explainability. Moreover, the potential opportunities and trends are discussed to provide insights for future research. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to provide a systematic review of AI security-related research in the geoscience and RS community. Available code and datasets are also listed in the paper to move this vibrant field of research forward.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coarse-to-fine Task-driven Inpainting for Geoscience Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11059v3)** | 2022-12-06 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2211.11059v3) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The processing and recognition of geoscience images have wide applications. Most of existing researches focus on understanding the high-quality geoscience images by assuming that all the images are clear. However, in many real-world cases, the geoscience images might contain occlusions during the image acquisition. This problem actually implies the image inpainting problem in computer vision and multimedia. To the best of our knowledge, all the existing image inpainting algorithms learn to repair the occluded regions for a better visualization quality, they are excellent for natural images but not good enough for geoscience images by ignoring the geoscience related tasks. This paper aims to repair the occluded regions for a better geoscience task performance with the advanced visualization quality simultaneously, without changing the current deployed deep learning based geoscience models. Because of the complex context of geoscience images, we propose a coarse-to-fine encoder-decoder network with coarse-to-fine adversarial context discriminators to reconstruct the occluded image regions. Due to the limited data of geoscience images, we use a MaskMix based data augmentation method to exploit more information from limited geoscience image data. The experimental results on three public geoscience datasets for remote sensing scene recognition, cross-view geolocation and semantic segmentation tasks respectively show the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the fidelity of explainable artificial intelligence methods for applications of convolutional neural networks in geoscience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.03407v2)** | 2022-09-05 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2202.03407v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently attracted great attention in geoscience due to their ability to capture non-linear system behavior and extract predictive spatiotemporal patterns. Given their black-box nature however, and the importance of prediction explainability, methods of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) are gaining popularity as a means to explain the CNN decision-making strategy. Here, we establish an intercomparison of some of the most popular XAI methods and investigate their fidelity in explaining CNN decisions for geoscientific applications. Our goal is to raise awareness of the theoretical limitations of these methods and gain insight into the relative strengths and weaknesses to help guide best practices. The considered XAI methods are first applied to an idealized attribution benchmark, where the ground truth of explanation of the network is known a priori, to help objectively assess their performance. Secondly, we apply XAI to a climate-related prediction setting, namely to explain a CNN that is trained to predict the number of atmospheric rivers in daily snapshots of climate simulations. Our results highlight several important issues of XAI methods (e.g., gradient shattering, inability to distinguish the sign of attribution, ignorance to zero input) that have previously been overlooked in our field and, if not considered cautiously, may lead to a distorted picture of the CNN decision-making strategy. We envision that our analysis will motivate further investigation into XAI fidelity and will help towards a cautious implementation of XAI in geoscience, which can lead to further exploitation of CNNs and deep learning for prediction problems.</p></details> |  |

However, the predominant reliance on visual encoding of data continues to create accessibility barriers for people who are blind/vision impaired resulting in their under representation in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This research study seeks to understand the experiences of professionals who are blind/vision impaired in one such STEM discipline (geosciences) in accessing data visualizations. In-depth, semi-structured interviews with seven professionals were conducted to examine the accessibility barriers and areas for improvement to inform accessibility research pertaining to data visualizations through a socio-technical lens. A reflexive thematic analysis revealed the negative impact of visualizations in influencing their career path, lack of data exploration tools for research, barriers in accessing works of peers and mismatched pace of visualization and accessibility research. The article also includes recommendations from the participants to address some of these accessibility barriers.</p></details> |  |

Many different methods have been introduced in the emerging field of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), which aim at attributing the network s prediction to specific features in the input domain. XAI methods are usually assessed by using benchmark datasets (like MNIST or ImageNet for image classification). However, an objective, theoretically derived ground truth for the attribution is lacking for most of these datasets, making the assessment of XAI in many cases subjective. Also, benchmark datasets specifically designed for problems in geosciences are rare. Here, we provide a framework, based on the use of additively separable functions, to generate attribution benchmark datasets for regression problems for which the ground truth of the attribution is known a priori. We generate a large benchmark dataset and train a fully connected network to learn the underlying function that was used for simulation. We then compare estimated heatmaps from different XAI methods to the ground truth in order to identify examples where specific XAI methods perform well or poorly. We believe that attribution benchmarks as the ones introduced herein are of great importance for further application of neural networks in the geosciences, and for more objective assessment and accurate implementation of XAI methods, which will increase model trust and assist in discovering new science.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an updated preprint version of the manuscript.

Quantifying complexity and non-stationarity of these data is a challenging task, and advanced complexity-based exploratory tool are required for understanding and visualizing such data.

The state-of-the-art studies related to the Fisher-Shannon measures are collected, and new analytical formulas for positive unimodal skewed distributions are proposed. Case studies on both synthetic and real data illustrate the usefulness of the Fisher-Shannon method, which can find application in different domains including time series discrimination and generation of times series features for clustering, modeling and forecasting. The paper is accompanied with Python and R libraries for the non-parametric estimation of the proposed measures.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

In remote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better understand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the governing processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference, thus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set of empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario that requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be used. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive noise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause and the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such principle only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward directions, and 2) the estimation of {\em statistical independence} between the obtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more independent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a criterion that uses the {\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence estimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting the dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious detections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal inference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and machine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182 problems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a carbon cycle problem. The criterion achieves state-of-the-art detection rates in all cases, it is generally robust to noise sources and distortions.</p></details> |  |

A thorough analysis of the co-developments of machine learning applications throughout the last 70 years relates the recent enthusiasm for machine learning to developments in geoscience. I explore the shift of kriging towards a mainstream machine learning method and the historic application of neural networks in geoscience, following the general trend of machine learning enthusiasm through the decades. Furthermore, this chapter explores the shift from mathematical fundamentals and knowledge in software development towards skills in model validation, applied statistics, and integrated subject matter expertise. The review is interspersed with code examples to complement the theoretical foundations and illustrate model validation and machine learning explainability for science. The scope of this review includes various shallow machine learning methods, e.g. Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support-Vector Machines, and Gaussian Processes, as well as, deep neural networks, including feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, recurrent neural networks and generative adversarial networks. Regarding geoscience, the review has a bias towards geophysics but aims to strike a balance with geochemistry, geostatistics, and geology, however excludes remote sensing, as this would exceed the scope.

As such, neural networks have often been used within the geosciences to most accurately identify a desired output given a set of inputs, with the interpretation of what the network learns used as a secondary metric to ensure the network is making the right decision for the right reason. Neural network interpretation techniques have become more advanced in recent years, however, and we therefore propose that the ultimate objective of using a neural network can also be the interpretation of what the network has learned rather than the output itself. We show that the interpretation of neural networks can enable the discovery of scientifically meaningful connections within geoscientific data. In particular, we use two methods for neural network interpretation called backwards optimization and layerwise relevance propagation, both of which project the decision pathways of a network back onto the original input dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, LRP has not yet been applied to geoscientific research, and we believe it has great potential in this area. We show how these interpretation techniques can be used to reliably infer scientifically meaningful information from neural networks by applying them to common climate patterns. These results suggest that combining interpretable neural networks with novel scientific hypotheses will open the door to many new avenues in neural network-related geoscience research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The second version of this manuscript is currently under review at the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems (JAMES)</p></details> |

Such extreme quantities of generated and modeled data greatly impact computational performances on many levels of high-performance computing (HPC): storage media, memory requirements, transfer capability, and finally simulation interactivity, necessary to exploit this instance of big data. Efficient representations and storage are thus becoming "enabling technologies'' in HPC experimental and simulation science. We propose HexaShrink, an original decomposition scheme for structured hexahedral volume meshes. The latter are used for instance in biomedical engineering, materials science, or geosciences. HexaShrink provides a comprehensive framework allowing efficient mesh visualization and storage. Its exactly reversible multiresolution decomposition yields a hierarchy of meshes of increasing levels of details, in terms of either geometry, continuous or categorical properties of cells. Starting with an overview of volume meshes compression techniques, our contribution blends coherently different multiresolution wavelet schemes in different dimensions. It results in a global framework preserving discontinuities (faults) across scales, implemented as a fully reversible upscaling at different resolutions. Experimental results are provided on meshes of varying size and complexity. They emphasize the consistency of the proposed representation, in terms of visualization, attribute downsampling and distribution at different resolutions. Finally, HexaShrink yields gains in storage space when combined to lossless compression techniques.</p></details> |  |

They have been applied in numerous science areas, but their application to the geosciences has been limited due to their inefficiency in high-dimensional systems in standard settings. However, huge progress has been made, and this limitation is disappearing fast due to recent developments in proposal densities, the use of ideas from (optimal) transportation, the use of localisation and intelligent adaptive resampling strategies. Furthermore, powerful hybrids between particle filters and ensemble Kalman filters and variational methods have been developed. We present a state of the art discussion of present efforts of developing particle filters for highly nonlinear geoscience state-estimation problems with an emphasis on atmospheric and oceanic applications, including many new ideas, derivations, and unifications, highlighting hidden connections, and generating a valuable tool and guide for the community. Initial experiments show that particle filters can be competitive with present-day methods for numerical weather prediction suggesting that they will become mainstream soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revie...</summary><p>Review paper, 36 pages, 9 figures, Resubmitted to Q.J.Royal Meteorol.

A rigorous statistical analysis of such observations is tricky, though. Observables can span several orders of magnitude, but the range for which the power law may be valid is typically truncated, usually because the smallest events are too tiny to be detected and the largest ones are limited by the system size. We revisit several examples of proposed power-law distributions dealing with potentially damaging natural phenomena. Adequate fits of the distributions of sizes are especially important in these cases, given that they may be used to assess long-term hazard. After reviewing the theoretical background for power-law distributions, we improve an objective statistical fitting method and apply it to diverse data sets. The method is described in full detail and it is easy to implement. Our analysis elucidates the range of validity of the power-law fit and the corresponding exponent, and whether a power-law tail is improved by a truncated log-normal. We confirm that impact fireballs and Californian earthquakes show untruncated power-law behavior, whereas global earthquakes follow a double power law. Rain precipitation over space and time and tropical cyclones show a truncated power-law regime. Karst sinkholes and wildfires, in contrast, are better described by truncated log-normals, although wildfires also may show power-law regimes. Our conclusions only apply to the analyzed data sets, but show the potential of applying this robust statistical technique in the future.</p></details> |  |

This term encompasses the entire sequence of operations that, starting from the observations of a system, and from additional statistical and dynamical information (such as a dynamical evolution model), provides an estimate of its state. Data assimilation is standard practice in numerical weather prediction, but its application is becoming widespread in many other areas of climate, atmosphere, ocean and environment modeling; in all circumstances where one intends to estimate the state of a large dynamical system based on limited information. While the complexity of data assimilation, and of the methods thereof, stands on its interdisciplinary nature across statistics, dynamical systems and numerical optimization, when applied to geosciences an additional difficulty arises by the continually increasing sophistication of the environmental models. Thus, in spite of data assimilation being nowadays ubiquitous in geosciences, it has so far remained a topic mostly reserved to experts. We aim this overview article at geoscientists with a background in mathematical and physical modeling, who are interested in the rapid development of data assimilation and its growing domains of application in environmental science, but so far have not delved into its conceptual and methodological complexities.</p></details> | <details><summary>79 pa...</summary><p>79 pages, 10 figures, Invited review</p></details> |

Thus, Wind Power Forecasting (WPF) has been widely recognized as one of the most critical issues in wind power integration and operation. There has been an explosion of studies on wind power forecasting problems in the past decades. Nevertheless, how to well handle the WPF problem is still challenging, since high prediction accuracy is always demanded to ensure grid stability and security of supply. We present a unique Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting dataset: SDWPF, which includes the spatial distribution of wind turbines, as well as the dynamic context factors. Whereas, most of the existing datasets have only a small number of wind turbines without knowing the locations and context information of wind turbines at a fine-grained time scale. By contrast, SDWPF provides the wind power data of 134 wind turbines from a wind farm over half a year with their relative positions and internal statuses. We use this dataset to launch the Baidu KDD Cup 2022 to examine the limit of current WPF solutions. The dataset is released at https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/competition/detail/152/0/datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a journal paper published in Scientific Data, titled SDWPF: A Dataset for Spatial Dynamic Wind Power Forecasting over a Large Turbine Array.

We find that spatial relations are generally rare in widely used VL datasets, with only a few being well represented, while most form a long tail of underrepresented relations. This gap leaves VLMs ill-equipped to handle diverse spatial relationships. To bridge it, we construct a synthetic VQA dataset focused on spatial reasoning generated from hyper-detailed image descriptions in Localized Narratives, DOCCI, and PixMo-Cap. Our dataset consists of 455k samples containing 3.4 million QA pairs. Trained on this dataset, our Spatial-Reasoning Enhanced (SpaRE) VLMs show strong improvements on spatial reasoning benchmarks, achieving up to a 49% performance gain on the What's Up benchmark, while maintaining strong results on general tasks. Our work narrows the gap between human and VLM spatial reasoning and makes VLMs more capable in real-world tasks such as robotics and navigation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing systems such as Simba and Sedona, which incorporate distributed spatial indexing, still incur substantial index construction overheads, rendering them far from optimal for real-time analytics. Recent studies demonstrate that learned indices can achieve high efficiency through well-designed machine learning models, but how to design a learned index for distributed spatial analytics remains unaddressed. In this paper, we present LiLIS, a Lightweight Distributed Learned Index for big spatial data. LiLIS combines machine-learned search strategies with spatial-aware partitioning within a distributed framework, and efficiently implements common spatial queries, including point query, range query, k-nearest neighbors (kNN), and spatial joins. Extensive experimental results over real-world and synthetic datasets show that LiLIS outperforms state-of-the-art big spatial data analytics by $2-3$ orders of magnitude for most spatial queries, and the index building achieves $1.5-2\times$ speed-up.

However, most linear models in imaging genetics didn't explicitly model the inner relationship among QTs, which might miss some potential efficiency gains from information borrowing across brain regions. In this work, we developed a novel Bayesian regression framework for identifying significant associations between QTs and genetic markers while explicitly modeling spatial dependency between QTs, with the main contributions as follows. Firstly, we developed a spatial-correlated multitask linear mixed-effects model (LMM) to account for dependencies between QTs. We incorporated a population-level mixed effects term into the model, taking full advantage of the dependent structure of brain imaging-derived QTs. Secondly, we implemented the model in the Bayesian framework and derived a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to achieve the model inference. Further, we incorporated the MCMC samples with the Cauchy combination test (CCT) to examine the association between SNPs and QTs, which avoided computationally intractable multi-test issues. The simulation studies indicated improved power of our proposed model compared to classic models where inner dependencies of QTs were not modeled. We also applied the new spatial model to an imaging dataset obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.</p></details> | 32 pages, 5 figures |

This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos and dataset are available at https://aaronz345.github.io/ISDramaDemo.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Mamba-based methods usually neglect the spectral and spatial directional characteristics related to heterogeneous objects in hyperspectral scenes, leading to limited classification performance. To address these issues, we propose MambaMoE, a novel spectral-spatial mixture-of-experts framework, representing the first MoE-based approach in the HSI classification community. Specifically, we design a Mixture of Mamba Expert Block (MoMEB) that leverages sparse expert activation to enable adaptive spectral-spatial modeling. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty-guided corrective learning (UGCL) strategy to encourage the model's attention toward complex regions prone to prediction ambiguity. Extensive experiments on multiple public HSI benchmarks demonstrate that MambaMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency compared to existing advanced approaches, especially for Mamba-based methods. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |

This allows attackers to control the model to misclassify poisoned samples with triggers into any desired target class during inference, exhibiting superior attack performance compared with conventional backdoor attacks. However, existing multi-target backdoor attacks fail to guarantee trigger specificity and stealthiness in black-box settings, resulting in two main issues. First, they are unable to simultaneously target all classes when only training data can be manipulated, limiting their effectiveness in realistic attack scenarios. Second, the triggers often lack visual imperceptibility, making poisoned samples easy to detect. To address these problems, we propose a Spatial-based Full-target Invisible Backdoor Attack, called SFIBA. It restricts triggers for different classes to specific local spatial regions and morphologies in the pixel space to ensure specificity, while employing a frequency-domain-based trigger injection method to guarantee stealthiness. Specifically, for injection of each trigger, we first apply fast fourier transform to obtain the amplitude spectrum of clean samples in local spatial regions. Then, we employ discrete wavelet transform to extract the features from the amplitude spectrum and use singular value decomposition to integrate the trigger. Subsequently, we selectively filter parts of the trigger in pixel space to implement trigger morphology constraints and adjust injection coefficients based on visual effects. We conduct experiments on multiple datasets and models. The results demonstrate that SFIBA can achieve excellent attack performance and stealthiness, while preserving the model's performance on benign samples, and can also bypass existing backdoor defenses.</p></details> |  |

However, the performance gap between SNNs and ANNs remains a substantial challenge hindering the widespread adoption of SNNs. In this paper, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Attention Aggregator SNN (STAA-SNN) framework, which dynamically focuses on and captures both spatial and temporal dependencies. First, we introduce a spike-driven self-attention mechanism specifically designed for SNNs. Additionally, we pioneeringly incorporate position encoding to integrate latent temporal relationships into the incoming features. For spatial-temporal information aggregation, we employ step attention to selectively amplify relevant features at different steps. Finally, we implement a time-step random dropout strategy to avoid local optima. As a result, STAA-SNN effectively captures both spatial and temporal dependencies, enabling the model to analyze complex patterns and make accurate predictions. The framework demonstrates exceptional performance across diverse datasets and exhibits strong generalization capabilities. Notably, STAA-SNN achieves state-of-the-art results on neuromorphic datasets CIFAR10-DVS, with remarkable performances of 97.14%, 82.05% and 70.40% on the static datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, respectively. Furthermore, our model exhibits improved performance ranging from 0.33\% to 2.80\% with fewer time steps.

These observations are commonly streams of RGB images, whose high dimensionality includes substantial task-irrelevant information, requiring large models to extract relevant patterns. In contrast, using more structured observations, such as the spatial poses (positions and orientations) of key objects over time, enables training more compact policies that can recognize relevant patterns with fewer parameters. However, obtaining accurate object poses in open-set, real-world environments remains challenging. For instance, it is impractical to assume that all relevant objects are equipped with markers, and recent learning-based 6D pose estimation and tracking methods often depend on pre-scanned object meshes, requiring manual reconstruction. In this work, we propose PRISM-DP, an approach that leverages segmentation, mesh generation, pose estimation, and pose tracking models to enable compact diffusion policy learning directly from the spatial poses of task-relevant objects. Crucially, because PRISM-DP uses a mesh generation model, it eliminates the need for manual mesh processing or creation, improving scalability and usability in open-set, real-world environments. Experiments across a range of tasks in both simulation and real-world settings show that PRISM-DP outperforms high-dimensional image-based diffusion policies and achieves performance comparable to policies trained with ground-truth state information. We conclude with a discussion of the broader implications and limitations of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose the Dynamic Contextual Attention Network (DCAN). This novel approach transforms spatial representations into adaptive contextual insights, using an attention mechanism that enhances focus on critical polyp regions without explicit localization modules. By integrating contextual awareness into the classification process, DCAN improves decision interpretability and overall diagnostic performance. This advancement in imaging could lead to more reliable colorectal cancer detection, enabling better patient outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 47th Annual International Conference of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society (EMBC) 2025</p></details> |

In this work we introduce SpatialReasoner, a novel large vision-language model (LVLM) that address 3D spatial reasoning with explicit 3D representations shared between stages -- 3D perception, computation, and reasoning. Explicit 3D representations provide a coherent interface that supports advanced 3D spatial reasoning and enable us to study the factual errors made by LVLMs. Results show that our SpatialReasoner achieve improved performance on a variety of spatial reasoning benchmarks and generalizes better when evaluating on novel 3D spatial reasoning questions.

To address this gap, we propose a novel generalized linear model to analyze such that using a von Mises Fisher (vMF) distributed error structure. Using a novel link function that relies on the transformation between Cartesian and spherical coordinates, we regress the vMF-distributed directional data on the external covariates. This regression model enables us to quantify the impact of external factors on the observed directional data. Furthermore, we impose the spatial dependence using an autoregressive model, appropriately accounting for the directional dependence in the outcome. This novel specification renders computational efficiency and flexibility. In addition, a comprehensive Bayesian inferential toolbox is thoroughly developed and applied to our analysis. Subsequently, employing our regression model on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, we gain new insights into the relationship between cognitive impairment and the orientations of brain fibers, along with examining empirical efficacy through simulation experiments.

Recognizing the sparsity and complexity of 3D space, previous vision-centric methods have employed implicit learning-based approaches to model spatial and temporal information. However, these approaches struggle to capture local details and diminish the model's spatial discriminative ability. To address these challenges, we propose a novel explicit state-based modeling method designed to leverage the occupied state to renovate the 3D features. Specifically, we propose a sparse occlusion-aware attention mechanism, integrated with a cascade refinement strategy, which accurately renovates 3D features with the guidance of occupied state information. Additionally, we introduce a novel method for modeling long-term dynamic interactions, which reduces computational costs and preserves spatial information. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art methods, our efficient explicit renovation strategy not only delivers superior performance in terms of RayIoU and mAVE for occupancy and scene flow prediction but also markedly reduces GPU memory usage during training, bringing it down to 8.7GB.

However, they face challenges in real-time collision-free planning. Hence, Robotic Attention Mamba (RAM) is designed for refined planning. Specifically, by integrating Mamba and parallel single-view attention, RAM aligns multi-view vision and task-related language features, ensuring efficient fine-grained task planning with linear complexity and robust real-time performance. Nevertheless, it has the potential for further improvement in high-precision grasping and manipulation. Thus, Grasp-Pretraining Augmentation (GPA) is devised, with a grasp pose feature extractor pretrained utilizing object grasp poses directly inherited from whole-task demonstrations. Subsequently, the extracted grasp features are fused with the spatially aligned planning features from RAM through attention-based Pre-trained Location Fusion, preserving high-resolution grasping cues overshadowed by an overemphasis on global planning. To summarize, we propose Grasp-Pretraining Augmented Robotic Attention Mamba (GPA-RAM), dividing spatial task learning into RAM for planning skill learning and GPA for grasping skill learning. GPA-RAM demonstrates superior performance across three robot systems with distinct camera configurations in simulation and the real world. Compared with previous state-of-the-art methods, it improves the absolute success rate by 8.2% (from 79.3% to 87.5%) on the RLBench multi-task benchmark and 40\% (from 16% to 56%), 12% (from 86% to 98%) on the ALOHA bimanual manipulation tasks, while delivering notably faster inference. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that both RAM and GPA enhance task learning, with GPA proving robust to different architectures of pretrained grasp pose feature extractors.

However, the motifs previously considered are either limited to a handful of nodes and edges, or do not include triangles, which are thought to be of critical relevance to understand the dynamics of social systems. Thus, we introduce a new class of motifs, that include these triangles, are not limited in their number of nodes or edges, and yet can be mined efficiently in any temporal network. Referring to these motifs as the edge-centered motifs, we show analytically how they subsume the Egocentric Temporal Neighborhoods motifs of the literature. We also confirm in empirical data that the edge-centered motifs bring relevant information with respect to the Egocentric motifs by using a principle of maximum entropy. Then, we show how mining for the edge-centered motifs in a network can be used to probe for spatial correlations in the underlying dynamics that have produced that network. We deduce an approximate formula for the distribution of the edge-centered motifs in empirical networks of social face-to-face interactions. In the last section of this paper, we explore how the statistics of the edge-centered motifs can be used to infer the complete topology of the network they were sampled from. This leads to the needs of mathematical development, that we inaugurate here under the name of graph tiling theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bullet: Boosting GPU Utilization for LLM Serving via Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19516v1)** | 2025-04-28 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.19516v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern LLM serving systems confront inefficient GPU utilization due to the fundamental mismatch between compute-intensive prefill and memory-bound decode phases. While current practices attempt to address this by organizing these phases into hybrid batches, such solutions create an inefficient tradeoff that sacrifices either throughput or latency, leaving substantial GPU resources underutilized. We identify two key root causes: 1) the prefill phase suffers from suboptimal compute utilization due to wave quantization and attention bottlenecks. 2) hybrid batches disproportionately prioritize latency over throughput, resulting in wasted compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate the issues, we present Bullet, a novel spatial-temporal orchestration system that eliminates these inefficiencies through precise phase coordination. Bullet enables concurrent execution of prefill and decode phases, while dynamically provisioning GPU resources using real-time performance modeling. By integrating SLO-aware scheduling and adaptive resource allocation, Bullet maximizes utilization without compromising latency targets. Experimental evaluations on real-world workloads demonstrate that Bullet delivers 1.26x average throughput gains (up to 1.55x) over state-of-the-arts, while consistently meeting latency constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency Domain Resampling for Gridded Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19337v1)** | 2025-04-27 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.19337v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In frequency domain analysis for spatial data, spectral averages based on the periodogram often play an important role in understanding spatial covariance structure, but also have complicated sampling distributions due to complex variances from aggregated periodograms. In order to nonparametrically approximate these sampling distributions for purposes of inference, resampling can be useful, but previous developments in spatial bootstrap have faced challenges in the scope of their validity, specifically due to issues in capturing the complex variances of spatial spectral averages. As a consequence, existing frequency domain bootstraps for spatial data are highly restricted in application to only special processes (e.g. Gaussian) or certain spatial statistics. To address this limitation and to approximate a wide range of spatial spectral averages, we propose a practical hybrid-resampling approach that combines two different resampling techniques in the forms of spatial subsampling and spatial bootstrap. Subsampling helps to capture the variance of spectral averages while bootstrap captures the distributional shape. The hybrid resampling procedure can then accurately quantify uncertainty in spectral inference under mild spatial assumptions. Moreover, compared to the more studied time series setting, this work fills a gap in the theory of subsampling/bootstrap for spatial data regarding spectral average statistics.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an adaptive and robust approach to changepoint testing. Specifically, by generalizing the classical mean-based cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic, we construct CUSUM statistics based on spatial medians and spatial signs. We introduce test statistics that consider the maximum and summation of the CUSUM statistics across different dimensions, respectively, and take the maximum across all potential changepoint locations. The asymptotic distributions of test statistics under the null hypothesis are derived. Furthermore, the test statistics exhibit asymptotic independence under mild conditions. Building on these results, we propose an adaptive testing procedure that combines the max-$L_\infty$-type and max-$L_2$-type statistics to achieve high power under both sparse and dense alternatives. Through numerical experiments and theoretical analysis, the proposed method demonstrates strong performance and exhibits robustness across a wide range of signal sparsity levels and heavy-tailed distributions.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep vision models such as the U-Net have been adapted to radio map estimation, whose effectiveness can be guaranteed with sufficient spatial observations (typically 0.01% to 1% of pixels) in each map, to model local dependency of observed signal power. However, such a setting of sufficient measurements can be less practical in real-world scenarios, where extreme sparsity in spatial sampling can be widely encountered. To address this challenge, we propose RadioFormer, a novel multiple-granularity transformer designed to handle the constraints posed by spatial sparse observations. Our RadioFormer, through a dual-stream self-attention (DSA) module, can respectively discover the correlation of pixel-wise observed signal power and also learn patch-wise buildings' geometries in a style of multiple granularities, which are integrated into multi-scale representations of radio maps by a cross stream cross-attention (CCA) module. Extensive experiments on the public RadioMapSeer dataset demonstrate that RadioFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in radio map estimation while maintaining the lowest computational cost. Furthermore, the proposed approach exhibits exceptional generalization capabilities and robust zero-shot performance, underscoring its potential to advance radio map estimation in a more practical setting with very limited observation nodes.</p></details> |  |

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality. Our code is open-sourced and is available at https://github.com/svg-project/Sparse-VideoGen</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We show that this approximate posterior retains the rate of recovery of the full data posterior distribution, where the rate of recovery adapts to the smoothness of the true regression function. As particular examples we consider Gaussian process priors based on integrated Brownian motion and the Mat\'ern kernel augmented with a prior on the length scale. Besides theoretical guarantees we present a numerical study of the methods both on synthetic and real world data. We also propose a new aggregation technique, which numerically outperforms previous approaches. Finally, we demonstrate empirically that spatially distributed methods can adapt to local regularities, potentially outperforming the original Gaussian process.</p></details> | 90 pages, 6 figures |

Although approaches have been proposed to support spatial dataset search and data point search, they consider the two types of searches independently. To enable search operations ranging from the coarse-grained dataset level to the fine-grained data point level, we provide an integrated one that supports diverse query types and distance metrics. In this paper, we focus on designing a multi-granularity spatial data search system, called Spadas, that supports both dataset and data point search operations. To address the challenges of the high cost of indexing and susceptibility to outliers, we propose a unified index that can drastically improve query efficiency in various scenarios by organizing data reasonably and removing outliers in datasets. Moreover, to accelerate all data search operations, we propose a set of pruning mechanisms based on the unified index, including fast bound estimation, approximation technique with error bound, and pruning in batch techniques, to effectively filter out non-relevant datasets and points. Finally, we report the results of a detailed experimental evaluation using six spatial data repositories, achieving orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art algorithms and demonstrating the effectiveness by case study. An online spatial data search system of Spadas is also implemented and made accessible to users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time High-fidelity Gaussian Human Avatars with Position-based Interpolation of Spatially Distributed MLPs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12909v2)** | 2025-04-26 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.12909v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many works have succeeded in reconstructing Gaussian human avatars from multi-view videos. However, they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP, or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation, for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis, and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way, although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly, the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets, allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body, to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method, our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

In recent years, with advances in geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI), numerous models have been developed to improve the accuracy of geographic variable predictions. Beyond achieving higher accuracy, it is equally important to obtain predictions with uncertainty measures to enhance model credibility and support responsible spatial prediction. Although geostatistic methods like Kriging offer some level of uncertainty assessment, such as Kriging variance, these measurements are not always accurate and lack general applicability to other spatial models. To address this issue, we propose a model-agnostic uncertainty assessment method called GeoConformal Prediction, which incorporates geographical weighting into conformal prediction. We applied it to two classic spatial prediction cases, spatial regression and spatial interpolation, to evaluate its reliability. First, in the spatial regression case, we used XGBoost to predict housing prices, followed by GeoConformal to calculate uncertainty. Our results show that GeoConformal achieved a coverage rate of 93.67%, while Bootstrap methods only reached a maximum coverage of 81.00% after 2000 runs. Next, we applied GeoConformal to spatial interpolation models. We found that the uncertainty obtained from GeoConformal aligned closely with the variance in Kriging. Finally, using GeoConformal, we analyzed the sources of uncertainty in spatial prediction. We found that explicitly including local features in AI models can significantly reduce prediction uncertainty, especially in areas with strong local dependence. Our findings suggest that GeoConformal holds potential not only for geographic knowledge discovery but also for guiding the design of future GeoAI models, paving the way for more reliable and interpretable spatial prediction frameworks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce spatial speech translation, a novel concept for hearables that translate speakers in the wearer's environment, while maintaining the direction and unique voice characteristics of each speaker in the binaural output. To achieve this, we tackle several technical challenges spanning blind source separation, localization, real-time expressive translation, and binaural rendering to preserve the speaker directions in the translated audio, while achieving real-time inference on the Apple M2 silicon. Our proof-of-concept evaluation with a prototype binaural headset shows that, unlike existing models, which fail in the presence of interference, we achieve a BLEU score of up to 22.01 when translating between languages, despite strong interference from other speakers in the environment. User studies further confirm the system's effectiveness in spatially rendering the translated speech in previously unseen real-world reverberant environments. Taking a step back, this work marks the first step towards integrating spatial perception into speech translation.</p></details> | Accepted by CHI2025 |

However, this task is often challenging due to the diversity of scenes, large number of fine-grained objects, and complex free-form nature of language references. Furthermore, in the 3D domain, obtaining large amounts of natural language training data is difficult. Thus, it is important for methods to learn from little data and zero-shot generalize to new environments. To address these challenges, we propose SORT3D, an approach that utilizes rich object attributes from 2D data and merges a heuristics-based spatial reasoning toolbox with the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform sequential reasoning. Importantly, our method does not require text-to-3D data for training and can be applied zero-shot to unseen environments. We show that SORT3D achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex view-dependent grounding tasks on two benchmarks. We also implement the pipeline to run real-time on an autonomous vehicle and demonstrate that our approach can be used for object-goal navigation on previously unseen real-world environments.

In this work, we present a novel system architecture that incorporates spatial speech understanding into LLMs, enabling contextually aware and adaptive applications for wearable technologies. Our approach leverages microstructure-based spatial sensing to extract precise Direction of Arrival (DoA) information using a monaural microphone. To address the lack of existing dataset for microstructure-assisted speech recordings, we synthetically create a dataset called OmniTalk by using the LibriSpeech dataset. This spatial information is fused with linguistic embeddings from OpenAI's Whisper model, allowing each modality to learn complementary contextual representations. The fused embeddings are aligned with the input space of LLaMA-3.2 3B model and fine-tuned with lightweight adaptation technique LoRA to optimize for on-device processing. SING supports spatially-aware automatic speech recognition (ASR), achieving a mean error of $25.72^\circ$-a substantial improvement compared to the 88.52$^\circ$ median error in existing work-with a word error rate (WER) of 5.3. SING also supports soundscaping, for example, inference how many people were talking and their directions, with up to 5 people and a median DoA error of 16$^\circ$. Our system demonstrates superior performance in spatial speech understanding while addressing the challenges of power efficiency, privacy, and hardware constraints, paving the way for advanced applications in augmented reality, accessibility, and immersive experiences.</p></details> |  |

We present a spatial reasoning framework that bridges geometric facts with symbolic predicates and relations to handle key tasks such as determining how 3D objects are arranged among each other ('on', 'behind', 'near', etc.). Its foundation relies on oriented 3D bounding box representations, enhanced by a comprehensive set of spatial predicates, ranging from topology and connectivity to directionality and orientation, expressed in a formalism related to natural language. The derived predicates form a spatial knowledge graph and, in combination with a pipeline-based inference model, enable spatial queries and dynamic rule evaluation. Implementations for client- and server-side processing demonstrate the framework's capability to efficiently translate geometric data into actionable knowledge, ensuring scalable and technology-independent spatial reasoning in complex 3D environments. The Spatial Reasoner framework is fostering the creation of spatial ontologies, and seamlessly integrates with and therefore enriches machine learning, natural language processing, and rule systems in XR applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, preprint of ICVARS 2025 paper</p></details> |

Compared to previous work, our Flow MAtching Postprocessing (FMAP) better represents the correlation structures of the observations distribution, while also improving marginal performance at the stations. FMAP generates forecasts that are not bound to what is already modeled by the underlying gridded prediction and can infer new correlation structures from data. The resulting model can generate an arbitrary number of forecasts from a limited number of numerical simulations, allowing for low-cost forecasting systems. A single training is sufficient to perform postprocessing at multiple lead times, in contrast with other methods which use multiple trained networks at generation time. This work details our methodology, including a spatial attention transformer backbone trained within a flow matching generative modeling framework. FMAP shows promising performance in experiments on the EUPPBench dataset, forecasting surface temperature and wind gust values at station locations in western Europe up to five-day lead times.</p></details> | 26 pages, 7 figures |

However, conventional MIL methods such as Attention-Based Deep Multiple Instance Learning (ABMIL) typically disregard spatial interactions among patches that are crucial to pathological diagnosis. Recent advancements, such as Transformer based MIL (TransMIL), have incorporated spatial context and inter-patch relationships. However, it remains unclear whether explicitly modeling patch relationships yields similar performance gains in ABMIL, which relies solely on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). In contrast, TransMIL employs Transformer-based layers, introducing a fundamental architectural shift at the cost of substantially increased computational complexity. In this work, we enhance the ABMIL framework by integrating interaction-aware representations to address this question. Our proposed model, Global ABMIL (GABMIL), explicitly captures inter-instance dependencies while preserving computational efficiency. Experimental results on two publicly available datasets for tumor subtyping in breast and lung cancers demonstrate that GABMIL achieves up to a 7 percentage point improvement in AUPRC and a 5 percentage point increase in the Kappa score over ABMIL, with minimal or no additional computational overhead. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating patch interactions within MIL frameworks.

However, challenges remain: (1) Semantic features often fail to provide accurate directional information, leading to superfluous actions, and (2) performance drops significantly when viewpoint inconsistencies arise between training and application. To address these challenges, we propose RSRNav, a simple yet effective method that reasons spatial relationships between the goal and current observations as navigation guidance. Specifically, we model the spatial relationship by constructing correlations between the goal and current observations, which are then passed to the policy network for action prediction. These correlations are progressively refined using fine-grained cross-correlation and direction-aware correlation for more precise navigation. Extensive evaluation of RSRNav on three benchmark datasets demonstrates superior navigation performance, particularly in the "user-matched goal" setting, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

They have demonstrated excellent performance in multiple domains involving graph-structured data. However, an important category of learning tasks, namely link weight prediction, has received less emphasis due to its increased complexity compared to binary link classification. Link weight prediction becomes even more challenging when considering multilayer networks, where nodes can be interconnected across multiple layers. To address these challenges, we propose a new method named Multiplex Spatial Graph Convolution Network (MSGCN), which spatially embeds information across multiple layers to predict interlayer link weights. The MSGCN model generalizes spatial graph convolution to multiplex networks and captures the geometric structure of nodes across multiple layers. Extensive experiments using data with known interlayer link information show that the MSGCN model has robust, accurate, and generalizable link weight prediction performance across a wide variety of multiplex network structures.</p></details> |  |

Previously proposed techniques require dense training data or have limited ability to handle significant spatial variability within a single place-type. Most importantly, these deep neural network (DNN) approaches are not designed to work in non-Euclidean space, particularly point sets. Existing non-Euclidean DNN methods are limited to one-size-fits-all approaches.

While current deep learning methods have made significant advancements, challenges remain in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy, robustness, and inference speed. To address these challenges, we propose the StereoMamba architecture, which is specifically designed for stereo disparity estimation in RAMIS. Our approach is based on a novel Feature Extraction Mamba (FE-Mamba) module, which enhances long-range spatial dependencies both within and across stereo images. To effectively integrate multi-scale features from FE-Mamba, we then introduce a novel Multidimensional Feature Fusion (MFF) module. Experiments against the state-of-the-art on the ex-vivo SCARED benchmark demonstrate that StereoMamba achieves superior performance on EPE of 2.64 px and depth MAE of 2.55 mm, the second-best performance on Bad2 of 41.49% and Bad3 of 26.99%, while maintaining an inference speed of 21.28 FPS for a pair of high-resolution images (1280*1024), striking the optimum balance between accuracy, robustness, and efficiency. Furthermore, by comparing synthesized right images, generated from warping left images using the generated disparity maps, with the actual right image, StereoMamba achieves the best average SSIM (0.8970) and PSNR (16.0761), exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization on the in-vivo RIS2017 and StereoMIS datasets.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches like on-device storage or reactive data fetching from the cloud often result in limited AR experiences or unacceptable lag. Edge caching, which caches AR objects closer to the user, provides a promising solution. However, existing edge caching approaches do not consider AR-specific features such as AR object sizes, user interactions, and physical location. This paper investigates how to further optimize edge caching by employing AR-aware prefetching techniques. We present SPAARC, a Spatial Proximity and Association-based Prefetching policy specifically designed for MAR Caches. SPAARC intelligently prioritizes the caching of virtual objects based on their association with other similar objects and the user's proximity to them. It also considers the recency of associations and uses a lazy fetching strategy to efficiently manage edge resources and maximize Quality of Experience (QoE). Through extensive evaluation using both synthetic and real-world workloads, we demonstrate that SPAARC significantly improves cache hit rates compared to standard caching algorithms, achieving gains ranging from 3% to 40% while reducing the need for on-demand data retrieval from the cloud. Further, we present an adaptive tuning algorithm that automatically tunes SPAARC parameters to achieve optimal performance. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SPAARC to substantially enhance the user experience in MAR applications by ensuring the timely availability of virtual objects.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods predominantly rely on spatial domain analysis, frequency domain operations are primarily limited to feature-level augmentation, leaving frequency-native artifacts and spatial-frequency interactions insufficiently exploited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel detection framework that integrates multi-scale spatial-frequency analysis for universal deepfake detection. Our framework comprises three key components: (1) a local spectral feature extraction pipeline that combines block-wise discrete cosine transform with cascaded multi-scale convolutions to capture subtle spectral artifacts; (2) a global spectral feature extraction pipeline utilizing scale-invariant differential accumulation to identify holistic forgery distribution patterns; and (3) a multi-stage cross-modal fusion mechanism that incorporates shallow-layer attention enhancement and deep-layer dynamic modulation to model spatial-frequency interactions.

This problem is societally important for many applications, such as generating clinical hypotheses for designing new immunotherapies for cancer treatment. The challenge lies in the spatial variability, the inherent heterogeneity and variation observed in spatial properties or arrangements across different locations (i.e., place-types). Previous techniques focus on self-supervised tasks to learn domain-invariant features and mitigate domain differences; however, they often neglect the underlying spatial arrangements among data points, leading to significant discrepancies across different place-types. We explore a novel multi-task self-learning framework that targets spatial arrangements, such as spatial mix-up masking and spatial contrastive predictive coding, for spatially-delineated domain-adapted AI classification. Experimental results on real-world datasets (e.g., oncology data) show that the proposed framework provides higher prediction accuracy than baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

Most existing functional regression models have limited applicability because they do not consider spatial correlations. Although functional kriging methods can predict the curves at unobserved spatial locations, they are based on variogram fittings rather than constructing hierarchical statistical models. In this manuscript, we propose a Bayesian framework for spatial function-on-function regression that can carry out parameter estimations and predictions. However, the proposed model has computational and inferential challenges because the model needs to account for within and between-curve dependencies. Furthermore, high-dimensional and spatially correlated parameters can lead to the slow mixing of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. To address these issues, we first utilize a basis transformation approach to simplify the covariance and apply projection methods for dimension reduction. We also develop a simultaneous band score for the proposed model to detect the significant region in the regression function. We apply our method to both areal and point-level spatial functional data, showing the proposed method is computationally efficient and provides accurate estimations and predictions.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian inference for such models is challenging since the resulting posterior distribution is doubly intractable. Although auxiliary variable MCMC (AVM) algorithms are known to be the most practical, they are computationally expensive due to the repeated auxiliary variable simulations. To address this, we propose delayed-acceptance AVM (DA-AVM) methods, which can reduce the number of auxiliary variable simulations. The first stage of the kernel uses a cheap surrogate to decide whether to accept or reject the proposed parameter value. The second stage guarantees detailed balance with respect to the posterior. The auxiliary variable simulation is performed only on the parameters accepted in the first stage. We construct various surrogates specifically tailored for doubly intractable problems, including subsampling strategy, Gaussian process emulation, and frequentist estimator-based approximation. We validate our method through simulated and real data applications, demonstrating its practicality for complex spatial models.</p></details> |  |

The problem is important since accurate quantification of the carbon cycle in agroecosystems is crucial for mitigating climate change and ensuring sustainable food production. Predicting accurate land emissions is challenging since calibrating the heterogeneous nature of soil properties, moisture, and environmental conditions is hard at decision-relevant scales. Traditional approaches do not adequately estimate land emissions due to location-independent parameters failing to leverage the spatial heterogeneity and also require large datasets. To overcome these limitations, we proposed Spatial Distribution-Shift Aware Knowledge-Guided Machine Learning (SDSA-KGML), which leverages location-dependent parameters that account for significant spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture from multiple sites within the same region. Experimental results demonstrate that SDSA-KGML models achieve higher local accuracy for the specified states in the Midwest Region.</p></details> |  |

However, its effectiveness in video recognition tasks is hampered by two main challenges. First, fast adversarial training for video models remains largely unexplored, which severely impedes its practical applications. Specifically, most video adversarial training methods are computationally costly, with long training times and high expenses. Second, existing methods struggle with the trade-off between clean accuracy and adversarial robustness. To address these challenges, we introduce Video Fast Adversarial Training with Weak-to-Strong consistency (VFAT-WS), the first fast adversarial training method for video data. Specifically, VFAT-WS incorporates the following key designs: First, it integrates a straightforward yet effective temporal frequency augmentation (TF-AUG), and its spatial-temporal enhanced form STF-AUG, along with a single-step PGD attack to boost training efficiency and robustness. Second, it devises a weak-to-strong spatial-temporal consistency regularization, which seamlessly integrates the simpler TF-AUG and the more complex STF-AUG. Leveraging the consistency regularization, it steers the learning process from simple to complex augmentations. Both of them work together to achieve a better trade-off between clean accuracy and robustness. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and HMDB-51 with both CNN and Transformer-based models demonstrate that VFAT-WS achieves great improvements in adversarial robustness and corruption robustness, while accelerating training by nearly 490%.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After the submission of the paper, we realized that the study still has room for expansion.

Some research suggests that VLMs can exhibit humanlike scene understanding, while other investigations reveal difficulties in their ability to process relational information. To achieve widespread applicability, VLMs must perform reliably, yielding comparable competence across a wide variety of related tasks. We sought to test how reliable these architectures are at engaging in trivial spatial cognition, e.g., recognizing whether one object is left of another in an uncluttered scene. We developed a benchmark dataset -- TableTest -- whose images depict 3D scenes of objects arranged on a table, and used it to evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs. Results show that performance could be degraded by minor variations of prompts that use logically equivalent descriptions. These analyses suggest limitations in how VLMs may reason about spatial relations in real-world applications. They also reveal novel opportunities for bolstering image caption corpora for more efficient training and testing.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on evidence that visual landmarks play a central role in spatial encoding, the proposed VPCE model activates visual place cells by clustering high-dimensional appearance features extracted from images captured by a robot-mounted camera. Each cluster center defines a receptive field, and activation is computed based on visual similarity using a radial basis function. We evaluate whether the resulting activation patterns correlate with key properties of biological place cells, including spatial proximity, orientation alignment, and boundary differentiation. Experiments demonstrate that the VPCE can distinguish between visually similar yet spatially distinct locations and adapt to environment changes such as the insertion or removal of walls. These results suggest that structured visual input, even in the absence of motion cues or reward-driven learning, is sufficient to generate place-cell-like spatial representations and support biologically inspired cognitive mapping.</p></details> |  |

CV is applicable in a wide range of statistical settings. However, in cases where data are not exchangeable, the design of CV schemes should account for suspected correlation structures within the data. CV scheme designs include the selection of left-out blocks and the choice of scoring function for evaluating predictive performance. This paper focuses on the impact of two scoring strategies for block-wise CV applied to spatial models with Gaussian covariance structures. We investigate, through several experiments, whether evaluating the predictive performance of blocks of left-out observations jointly, rather than aggregating individual (pointwise) predictions, improves model selection performance. Extending recent findings for data with serial correlation (such as time-series data), our experiments suggest that joint scoring reduces the variability of CV estimates, leading to more reliable model selection, particularly when spatial dependence is strong and model differences are subtle.</p></details> |  |

Recently, adopted event oriented multi-track methods affect the generality in polyphonic environments due to the limitation of the number of tracks. To enhance the generality in polyphonic environments, we propose Spatial Mapping and Regression Localization for SELD (SMRL-SELD). SMRL-SELD segments the 3D spatial space, mapping it to a 2D plane, and a new regression localization loss is proposed to help the results converge toward the location of the corresponding event. SMRL-SELD is location-oriented, allowing the model to learn event features based on orientation. Thus, the method enables the model to process polyphonic sounds regardless of the number of overlapping events. We conducted experiments on STARSS23 and STARSS22 datasets and our proposed SMRL-SELD outperforms the existing SELD methods in overall evaluation and polyphony environments.</p></details> |  |

To test models' ability to reason about multiple occluded objects, we introduce a novel task, Counting Amodally for Patterns Through Unseen REgions (CAPTURe), which requires a model to count objects arranged in a pattern by inferring how the pattern continues behind an occluder (an object which blocks parts of the scene). CAPTURe requires both recognizing visual patterns and reasoning, making it a useful testbed for evaluating vision-language models (VLMs) on whether they understand occluded patterns and possess spatial understanding skills. By requiring models to reason about occluded objects, CAPTURe also tests VLMs' ability to form world models that would allow them to fill in missing information. CAPTURe consists of two parts: (1) CAPTURe-real, with manually filtered images of real objects in patterns and (2) CAPTURe-synthetic, a controlled diagnostic with generated patterned images. We evaluate four strong VLMs (GPT-4o, Intern-VL2, Molmo, and Qwen2-VL) on CAPTURe, finding that models struggle to count on both occluded and unoccluded patterns. Crucially, we find that models perform worse with occlusion, suggesting that VLMs are also deficient in inferring unseen spatial relationships: even the strongest VLMs like GPT-4o fail to count with occlusion. In contrast, we find that humans achieve very little error on CAPTURe. We also find that providing auxiliary information of occluded object locations increases performance, underscoring that the model error comes both from an inability to handle occlusion as well as difficulty counting in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data: https://github.com/atinpothiraj/CAPTURe</p></details> |

Current surrogate models fall short in the flexibility of point- or region-based predictions as the entire field reconstruction is required for each parameter setting, hence hindering the efficiency of parameter space exploration. Limitations exist in capturing physical attribute distributions and pinpointing optimal parameter configurations. In this work, we propose Explorable INR, a novel implicit neural representation-based surrogate model, designed to facilitate exploration and allow point-based spatial queries without computing full-scale field data. In addition, to further address computational bottlenecks of spatial exploration, we utilize probabilistic affine forms (PAFs) for uncertainty propagation through Explorable INR to obtain statistical summaries, facilitating various ensemble analysis and visualization tasks that are expensive with existing models. Furthermore, we reformulate the parameter exploration problem as optimization tasks using gradient descent and KL divergence minimization that ensures scalability. We demonstrate that the Explorable INR with the proposed approach for spatial and parameter exploration can significantly reduce computation and memory costs while providing effective ensemble analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics (TVCG)</p></details> |

While MLLMs have been extensively studied for visual semantic understanding tasks, their ability to perform precise and quantitative spatial-temporal understanding in real-world applications remains largely unexamined, leading to uncertain prospects. To evaluate models' Spatial-Temporal Intelligence, we introduce STI-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' spatial-temporal understanding through challenging tasks such as estimating and predicting the appearance, pose, displacement, and motion of objects. Our benchmark encompasses a wide range of robot and vehicle operations across desktop, indoor, and outdoor scenarios. The extensive experiments reveals that the state-of-the-art MLLMs still struggle in real-world spatial-temporal understanding, especially in tasks requiring precise distance estimation and motion analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have exposed critical limitations in their spatial reasoning capabilities. This deficiency in spatial reasoning significantly constrains MLLMs' ability to interact effectively with the physical world, thereby limiting their broader applications. We argue that spatial reasoning capabilities will not naturally emerge from merely scaling existing architectures and training methodologies. Instead, this challenge demands dedicated attention to fundamental modifications in the current MLLM development approach. In this position paper, we first establish a comprehensive framework for spatial reasoning within the context of MLLMs. We then elaborate on its pivotal role in real-world applications. Through systematic analysis, we examine how individual components of the current methodology-from training data to reasoning mechanisms-influence spatial reasoning capabilities. This examination reveals critical limitations while simultaneously identifying promising avenues for advancement. Our work aims to direct the AI research community's attention toward these crucial yet underexplored aspects. By highlighting these challenges and opportunities, we seek to catalyze progress toward achieving human-like spatial reasoning capabilities in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we introduce a novel task, 360V2SA, to generate spatial audio from 360-degree videos, specifically producing First-order Ambisonics (FOA) audio - a standard format for representing 3D spatial audio that captures sound directionality and enables realistic 3D audio reproduction. We first create Sphere360, a novel dataset tailored for this task that is curated from real-world data. We also design an efficient semi-automated pipeline for collecting and cleaning paired video-audio data. To generate spatial audio from 360-degree video, we propose a novel framework OmniAudio, which leverages self-supervised pre-training using both spatial audio data (in FOA format) and large-scale non-spatial data. Furthermore, OmniAudio features a dual-branch framework that utilizes both panoramic and FoV video inputs to capture comprehensive local and global information from 360-degree videos. Experimental results demonstrate that OmniAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance across both objective and subjective metrics on Sphere360.

While classification models have seen extensive development of defense mechanisms, generative models remain largely unprotected due to their high-dimensional output space, which complicates the detection and mitigation of subtle perturbations. Defense strategies for diffusion models, in particular, remain under-explored. In this work, we propose Spatial Attention Unlearning (SAU), a novel technique for mitigating backdoor attacks in diffusion models. SAU leverages latent space manipulation and spatial attention mechanisms to isolate and remove the latent representation of backdoor triggers, ensuring precise and efficient removal of malicious effects. We evaluate SAU across various types of backdoor attacks, including pixel-based and style-based triggers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in achieving 100% trigger removal accuracy. Furthermore, SAU achieves a CLIP score of 0.7023, outperforming existing methods while preserving the model's ability to generate high-quality, semantically aligned images. Our results show that SAU is a robust, scalable, and practical solution for securing text-to-image diffusion models against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, in many practical scenarios such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data includes label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. Bayesian inference requires computing the posterior distribution of label errors, which becomes intractable when spatial correlations are present. We represent the correlation of label errors between adjacent pixels through a Gaussian distribution whose covariance is structured by a Kac-Murdock-Szeg\"{o} (KMS) matrix, solving the computational challenges. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

However, the high cost, limited coverage, and technical complexity of current ST technologies restrict their widespread use in clinical and research settings, making obtaining high-resolution transcriptomic profiles across large tissue areas challenging. Predicting ST from H\&E-stained histology images has emerged as a promising alternative to address these limitations but remains challenging due to the heterogeneous relationship between histomorphology and gene expression, which is affected by substantial variability across patients and tissue sections. In response, we propose PH2ST, a prompt-guided hypergraph learning framework, which leverages limited ST signals to guide multi-scale histological representation learning for accurate and robust spatial gene expression prediction. Extensive evaluations on two public ST datasets and multiple prompt sampling strategies simulating real-world scenarios demonstrate that PH2ST not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, but also shows strong potential for practical applications such as imputing missing spots, ST super-resolution, and local-to-global prediction, highlighting its value for scalable and cost-effective spatial gene expression mapping in biomedical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Traditional solutions typically involve training dedicated models per degradation, resulting in inefficiency and redundancy. More recent approaches either introduce additional modules to learn visual prompts, significantly increasing model size, or incorporate cross-modal transfer from large language models trained on vast datasets, adding complexity to the system architecture. In contrast, our approach, termed AnyIR, takes a unified path that leverages inherent similarity across various degradations to enable both efficient and comprehensive restoration through a joint embedding mechanism, without scaling up the model or relying on large language models.Specifically, we examine the sub-latent space of each input, identifying key components and reweighting them first in a gated manner. To fuse the intrinsic degradation awareness and the contextualized attention, a spatial-frequency parallel fusion strategy is proposed for enhancing spatial-aware local-global interactions and enriching the restoration details from the frequency perspective. Extensive benchmarking in the all-in-one restoration setting confirms AnyIR's SOTA performance, reducing model complexity by around 82\% in parameters and 85\% in FLOPs.

Neural network-based thermal prediction models can perform real-time predictions for many unseen new designs. However, existing CNN-based and GCN-based methods cannot effectively capture the global thermal features, especially for high-frequency components, hindering prediction accuracy enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel frequency-spatial dual domain aware prediction network (FSA-Heat) for fast and high-accuracy thermal prediction in 2.5D ICs. It integrates high-to-low frequency and spatial domain encoder (FSTE) module with frequency domain cross-scale interaction module (FCIFormer) to achieve high-to-low frequency and global-to-local thermal dissipation feature extraction. Additionally, a frequency-spatial hybrid loss (FSL) is designed to effectively attenuate high-frequency thermal gradient noise and spatial misalignments. The experimental results show that the performance enhancements offered by our proposed method are substantial, outperforming the newly-proposed 2.5D method, GCN+PNA, by considerable margins (over 99% RMSE reduction, 4.23X inference time speedup). Moreover, extensive experiments demonstrate that FSA-Heat also exhibits robust generalization capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 22nd Design, Automation and Test in Europe Conference (DATE '25)</p></details> |

This allows models to develop a comprehensive understanding of the 3D scene, enabling their applicability to a broader range of areas, such as autonomous navigation, robotics, and AR/VR. While large multi-modal models (LMMs) have achieved remarkable progress in a wide range of image and video understanding tasks, their capabilities to perform 3D spatial reasoning on diverse natural images are less studied. In this work we present the first comprehensive 3D spatial reasoning benchmark, 3DSRBench, with 2,772 manually annotated visual question-answer pairs across 12 question types.

However, they still struggle to properly render the spatial relationships described in text prompts. To address the lack of spatial information in T2I generations, existing methods typically use external network conditioning and predefined layouts, resulting in higher computational costs and reduced flexibility. Our approach builds upon a curated dataset of spatially explicit prompts, meticulously extracted and synthesized from LAION-400M to ensure precise alignment between textual descriptions and spatial layouts. Alongside this dataset, we present ESPLoRA, a flexible fine-tuning framework based on Low-Rank Adaptation, specifically designed to enhance spatial consistency in generative models without increasing generation time or compromising the quality of the outputs. In addition to ESPLoRA, we propose refined evaluation metrics grounded in geometric constraints, capturing 3D spatial relations such as \textit{in front of} or \textit{behind}. These metrics also expose spatial biases in T2I models which, even when not fully mitigated, can be strategically exploited by our TORE algorithm to further improve the spatial consistency of generated images. Our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art framework, CoMPaSS, by 13.33% on established spatial consistency benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Previous work has established that the VAMP decoder for SS achieves Shannon capacity when the design matrix satisfies a specific spectral criterion and exponential decay power allocation is used. In this work, we propose a spatially coupled VAMP (SC-VAMP) decoder for SS with spatially coupled design matrices. Based on state evolution (SE) analysis, we demonstrate that the SC-VAMP decoder is capacity-achieving when the design matrices satisfy the spectra criterion. Empirically, we show that the SC-VAMP decoder outperforms the VAMP decoder with exponential decay power allocation, achieving a lower section error rate.

Existing benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities. To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning: multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across 5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns observed in real-world image settings.

Our method proposes using HDR Gaussian Splats as light source representation, marking the first time regular images can serve as light sources in a 3D renderer. Our two-stage process first enhances the dynamic range of images plausibly and accurately by leveraging the priors embedded in diffusion models. Next, we employ Gaussian Splats to model 3D lighting, achieving spatially variant lighting. Our approach yields state-of-the-art results on HDR estimations and their applications in illuminating virtual objects and scenes. To facilitate the benchmarking of images as light sources, we introduce a novel dataset of calibrated and unsaturated HDR to evaluate images as light sources.

We propose a novel estimator of the parametric component based on random thinning, a common sampling technique in point processes. The proposed estimator of the parametric component is shown to be consistent and asymptotically normal if the nonparametric component can be estimated at the desired rate. We then extend a popular kernel-based estimator in i.i.d. settings and establish convergence rates that will enable inference for the parametric component. Next, we generalize the notion of semiparametric efficiency lower bound in i.i.d. settings to spatial point processes and show that the proposed estimator achieves the efficiency lower bound if the process is Poisson. Computationally, we show how to efficiently evaluate the proposed estimator with existing software for generalized partial linear models in i.i.d. settings by tailoring the sampling weights to replicate the dependence induced by the point process. We conclude with a small simulation study and a re-analysis of the spatial distribution of rainforest trees.</p></details> |  |

Although single-pattern structured light enables single-shot shape reconstruction, the reflectance is challenging to recover due to the lack of angular sampling of incident light and the entanglement of the projected pattern and the surface color texture. We design a spatially multiplexed pattern of polarization that can be robustly and uniquely decoded for shape reconstruction by quantizing the AoLP values. At the same time, our spatial-multiplexing enables single-shot ellipsometry of linear polarization by projecting differently polarized light within a local region, which separates the specular and diffuse reflections for BRDF estimation. We achieve this spatial polarization multiplexing with a constrained de Bruijn sequence. Unlike single-pattern structured light with intensity and color, our polarization pattern is invisible to the naked eye and retains the natural surface appearance which is essential for accurate appearance modeling and also interaction with people. We experimentally validate our method on real data. The results show that our method can recover the shape, the Mueller matrix, and the BRDF from a single-shot polarimetric image. We also demonstrate the application of our method to dynamic surfaces.</p></details> |  |

While spatial language understanding and reasoning by vision-language models (VLMs) have gained increasing attention, potential ambiguities in these models are still under-explored. To address this issue, we present the COnsistent Multilingual Frame Of Reference Test (COMFORT), an evaluation protocol to systematically assess the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs using COMFORT. Despite showing some alignment with English conventions in resolving ambiguities, our experiments reveal significant shortcomings of VLMs: notably, the models (1) exhibit poor robustness and consistency, (2) lack the flexibility to accommodate multiple FoRs, and (3) fail to adhere to language-specific or culture-specific conventions in cross-lingual tests, as English tends to dominate other languages. With a growing effort to align vision-language models with human cognitive intuitions, we call for more attention to the ambiguous nature and cross-cultural diversity of spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025 (Oral) | Project page: https://spatial-comfort.github.io/</p></details> |

Methods are developed to control the FDR, separately for positive and negative excursions, as well as jointly over both. Furthermore, power is increased by incorporating a two-stage adaptive procedure. Simulation results with various signals show that our confidence regions successfully control the FDR under the nominal level. We showcase our methods with an application to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data from the Human Connectome Project illustrating the improvement in statistical power over existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce VistaDPO, a novel framework for Video Hierarchical Spatial-Temporal Direct Preference Optimization. VistaDPO enhances text-video preference alignment across three hierarchical levels: i) Instance Level, aligning overall video content with responses; ii) Temporal Level, aligning video temporal semantics with event descriptions; and iii) Perceptive Level, aligning spatial objects with language tokens. Given the lack of datasets for fine-grained video-language preference alignment, we construct VistaDPO-7k, a dataset of 7.2K QA pairs annotated with chosen and rejected responses, along with spatial-temporal grounding information such as timestamps, keyframes, and bounding boxes. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as Video Hallucination, Video QA, and Captioning performance tasks demonstrate that VistaDPO significantly improves the performance of existing LVMs, effectively mitigating video-language misalignment and hallucination.

While previous studies have evaluated the robustness of semantic segmentation (SS) models under whole-image natural or adversarial corruptions, a comprehensive investigation into the spatial robustness of dense vision models under localized corruptions remained underexplored. This paper fills this gap by introducing specialized metrics for benchmarking the spatial robustness of segmentation models, alongside with an evaluation framework to assess the impact of localized corruptions. Furthermore, we uncover the inherent complexity of characterizing worst-case robustness using a single localized adversarial perturbation. To address this, we propose region-aware multi-attack adversarial analysis, a method that enables a deeper understanding of model robustness against adversarial perturbations applied to specific regions. The proposed metrics and analysis were exploited to evaluate 14 segmentation models in driving scenarios, uncovering key insights into the effects of localized corruption in both natural and adversarial forms. The results reveal that models respond to these two types of threats differently; for instance, transformer-based segmentation models demonstrate notable robustness to localized natural corruptions but are highly vulnerable to adversarial ones and vice-versa for CNN-based models. Consequently, we also address the challenge of balancing robustness to both natural and adversarial localized corruptions by means of ensemble models, thereby achieving a broader threat coverage and improved reliability for dense vision tasks.</p></details> | Under review |

In this study, a spatial functional deep neural network model was developed with a novel non-linear modeling framework that seamlessly integrates spatial dependencies and functional predictors using deep learning techniques. The proposed model extends classical scalar-on-function regression by incorporating a spatial autoregressive component while leveraging functional deep neural networks to capture complex non-linear relationships. To ensure a robust estimation, the methodology employs an adaptive estimation approach, where the spatial dependence parameter was first inferred via maximum likelihood estimation, followed by non-linear functional regression using deep learning. The effectiveness of the proposed model was evaluated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations and an application to Brazilian COVID-19 data, where the goal was to predict the average daily number of deaths. Comparative analysis with maximum likelihood-based spatial functional linear regression and functional deep neural network models demonstrates that the proposed algorithm significantly improves predictive performance. The results for the Brazilian COVID-19 data showed that while all models achieved similar mean squared error values over the training modeling phase, the proposed model achieved the lowest mean squared prediction error in the testing phase, indicating superior generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, the non-stationary nature of EEG signals and significant inter-subject variability cause substantial challenges for developing robust cross-subject classification models. This paper introduces a novel Spatial-Spectral-Temporal Attention Fusion (SSTAF) Transformer specifically designed for upper-limb motor imagery classification. Our architecture consists of a spectral transformer and a spatial transformer, followed by a transformer block and a classifier network. Each module is integrated with attention mechanisms that dynamically attend to the most discriminative patterns across multiple domains, such as spectral frequencies, spatial electrode locations, and temporal dynamics. The short-time Fourier transform is incorporated to extract features in the time-frequency domain to make it easier for the model to obtain a better feature distinction. We evaluated our SSTAF Transformer model on two publicly available datasets, the EEGMMIDB dataset, and BCI Competition IV-2a. SSTAF Transformer achieves an accuracy of 76.83% and 68.30% in the data sets, respectively, outperforms traditional CNN-based architectures and a few existing transformer-based approaches.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Rather than directly stabilizing the uncertain system, we focus on stabilizing an interval observer in a higher dimensional space, whose states bound the true system states. Our nonlinear dynamic control method introduces added flexibility over traditional static and linear approaches, effectively compensating for system nonlinearities and enabling potentially tighter closed-loop intervals. Additionally, we establish a separation principle that allows for the design of observer and control gains. We further derive tractable matrix inequalities to ensure system stability in the closed-loop configuration.

In contrast, our knowledge of the \emph{message complexity} of distributed computing problems and its relationship (if any) with round complexity is still quite limited. To illustrate, for many fundamental distributed graph optimization problems such as (exact) diameter computation, All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP), Maximum Matching etc., while (near) round-optimal algorithms are known, message-optimal algorithms are hitherto unknown. More importantly, the existing round-optimal algorithms are not message-optimal. This raises two important questions: (1) Can we design message-optimal algorithms for these problems? (2) Can we give message-time tradeoffs for these problems in case the message-optimal algorithms are not round-optimal? In this work, we focus on a fundamental graph optimization problem, \emph{All Pairs Shortest Path (APSP)}, whose message complexity is still unresolved. We present two main results in the CONGEST model: (1) We give a message-optimal (up to logarithmic factors) algorithm that solves weighted APSP, using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ messages. This algorithm takes $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ rounds. (2) For any $0 \leq \varepsilon \le 1$, we show how to solve unweighted APSP in $\tilde{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon })$ rounds and $\tilde{O}(n^{2+\varepsilon })$ messages. At one end of this smooth trade-off, we obtain a (nearly) message-optimal algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n^2)$ messages (for $\varepsilon = 0$), whereas at the other end we get a (nearly) round-optimal algorithm using $\tilde{O}(n)$ rounds (for $\varepsilon = 1$). This is the first such message-time trade-off result known.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PODC 2025, abstract shortened to fit arXiv constraints</p></details> |

This can be used to enhance the accuracy of maintenance policies and increase the effectiveness of the equipment. In this work, we propose a method for one-step probabilistic multivariate forecasting of time variables involved in a production process. The method is based on an Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IO-HMM), in which the parameters of interest are the state transition probabilities and the parameters of the observations' joint density. The ultimate goal of the method is to predict operational process times in the near future, which enables the identification of hidden losses and the location of improvement areas in the process. The input stream in the IO-HMM model includes past values of the response variables and other process features, such as calendar variables, that can have an impact on the model's parameters. The discrete part of the IO-HMM models the operational mode of the process. The state transition probabilities are supposed to change over time and are updated using Bayesian principles. The continuous part of the IO-HMM models the joint density of the response variables. The estimate of the continuous model parameters is recursively computed through an adaptive algorithm that also admits a Bayesian interpretation. The adaptive algorithm allows for efficient updating of the current parameter estimates as soon as new information is available. We evaluate the method's performance using a real data set obtained from a company in a particular sector, and the results are compared with a collection of benchmark models.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

While the standard toolkit for multivariate time series analysis has many advantages, it can be difficult to capture nonlinear dynamics using linear vector autoregressive models. This difficulty has motivated the development of methods for variable selection, causal discovery, and graphical modeling for nonlinear time series, which routinely employ nonparametric tests for conditional independence. In this paper, we introduce the first framework for conditional independence testing that works with a single realization of a nonstationary nonlinear process. The key technical ingredients are time-varying nonlinear regression, time-varying covariance estimation, and a distribution-uniform strong Gaussian approximation.</p></details> |  |

Inference for these estimators is well-developed in settings where all post-treatment data is available at the time of analysis. However, in settings where data arrives sequentially, these tests do not permit real-time inference, as they require a pre-specified sample size T. We introduce real-time inference for program evaluation through anytime-valid rank tests. Our methodology relies on interpreting the absence of a treatment effect as exchangeability of the treatment estimates. We then convert these treatment estimates into sequential ranks, and construct optimal finite-sample valid sequential tests for exchangeability. We illustrate our methods in the context of difference-in-differences and synthetic control. In simulations, they control size even under mild exchangeability violations. While our methods suffer slight power loss at T, they allow for early rejection (before T) and preserve the ability to reject later (after T).</p></details> |  |

The recent effort in simplifying the masked diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper, however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models, and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation raises doubts about whether MDMs can truly beat ARMs in text generation. We identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the commonly used 32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical sampling. We show that it lowers the effective temperature both theoretically and empirically, and the resulting decrease in token diversity makes previous evaluations, which assess the generation quality solely through the incomplete generative perplexity metric, somewhat unfair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, their monotonicity and $L^{\infty}$-stability remain underexplored. Extending existing results on simpler BGK schemes, we derive conditions ensuring that TRT schemes are monotone and stable by leveraging their unique relaxation structure. Our analysis culminates in proving convergence of the numerical solution to the weak entropy solution of the conservation law. Compared to BGK schemes, TRT schemes achieve reduced numerical diffusion while retaining provable convergence. Numerical experiments validate and illustrate the theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods generate new yet effective data during model training to improve performance. However, deploying them requires retraining, architecture modification, or introducing additional learnable parameters. The above steps are time-consuming and costly for well-trained models, especially when the model scale becomes large. In this work, we explore the test-time augmentation (TTA) for sequential recommendation, which augments the inputs during the model inference and then aggregates the model's predictions for augmented data to improve final accuracy. It avoids significant time and cost overhead from loss calculation and backward propagation. We first experimentally disclose the potential of existing augmentation operators for TTA and find that the Mask and Substitute consistently achieve better performance. Further analysis reveals that these two operators are effective because they retain the original sequential pattern while adding appropriate perturbations. Meanwhile, we argue that these two operators still face time-consuming item selection or interference information from mask tokens. Based on the analysis and limitations, we present TNoise and TMask. The former injects uniform noise into the original representation, avoiding the computational overhead of item selection. The latter blocks mask token from participating in model calculations or directly removes interactions that should have been replaced with mask tokens. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and generalizability of our method.

Both the space-time white noise ($d=1$) and the trace-class noise in multiple dimensions $d=2,3$ are examined for the considered SPDEs. Based on a spectral Galerkin spatial semi-discretization, we propose a class of novel full-discretization schemes of exponential type, which are explicit, easily implementable and preserve the ergodicity of the original dissipative SPDEs with possibly non-contractive coefficients. The uniform-in-time weak approximation errors are carefully analyzed in a low regularity and non-contractive setting, with uniform-in-time weak convergence rates obtained. A key ingredient is to establish the uniform-in-time moment bounds (in $L^{4q-2}$-norm, $q \geq 1$) for the proposed fully discrete schemes in a super-linear setting. This is highly non-trivial for the explicit full-discretization schemes and new arguments are elaborated by fully exploiting a contractive property of the semi-group in $L^{4q-2}$, the dissipativity of the nonlinearity and the particular benefit of the taming strategy. Numerical experiments are finally reported to verify the theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

However, mobility and non-rigid sensor mounts introduce extrinsic calibration errors, necessitating online calibration, further complicated by limited overlap in sensing regions. Moreover, maintaining fresh information is crucial for timely and accurate sensing. To address calibration errors and ensure timely and accurate perception, we propose a robust task-oriented communication strategy to optimize online self-calibration and efficient feature sharing for Real-time Adaptive Collaborative Perception (R-ACP). Specifically, we first formulate an Age of Perceived Targets (AoPT) minimization problem to capture data timeliness of multi-view streaming. Then, in the calibration phase, we introduce a channel-aware self-calibration technique based on reidentification (Re-ID), which adaptively compresses key features according to channel capacities, effectively addressing calibration issues via spatial and temporal cross-camera correlations. In the streaming phase, we tackle the trade-off between bandwidth and inference accuracy by leveraging an Information Bottleneck (IB) based encoding method to adjust video compression rates based on task relevance, thereby reducing communication overhead and latency. Finally, we design a priority-aware network to filter corrupted features to mitigate performance degradation from packet corruption. Extensive studies demonstrate that our framework outperforms five baselines, improving multiple object detection accuracy (MODA) by 25.49% and reducing communication costs by 51.36% under severely poor channel conditions.

Transformer-based SRS have achieved distinguished successes recently. However, studies reveal self-attention mechanism in Transformer-based models is essentially a low-pass filter and ignores high frequency information potentially including meaningful user interest patterns. This motivates us to seek better filtering technologies for SRS, and finally we find Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), a famous time-frequency analysis technique from digital signal processing field, can effectively process both low-frequency and high-frequency information. We design an adaptive time-frequency filter with DWT technique, which decomposes user interests into multiple signals with different frequency and time, and can automatically learn weights of these signals. Furthermore, we develop DWTRec, a model for sequential recommendation all based on the adaptive time-frequency filter. Thanks to fast DWT technique, DWTRec has a lower time complexity and space complexity theoretically, and is Proficient in modeling long sequences. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baseline models in datasets with different domains, sparsity levels and average sequence lengths. Especially, our model shows great performance increase in contrast with previous models when the sequence grows longer, which demonstrates another advantage of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>17pag...</summary><p>17pages, accepted by ICIC 2025 oral</p></details> |
| **[Hurdle Network Model With Latent Dynamic Shrinkage For Enhanced Edge Prediction in Zero-Inflated Directed Network Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21275v1)** | 2025-04-30 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.21275v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article aims to model international trade relationships among 29 countries in the apparel industry between 1994 and 2013. Bilateral trade flows can be represented as a directed network, where nodes correspond to countries and directed edges indicate trade flows (i.e., whether one country exported to another in a given year). Additionally, node (e.g., GDP) and edge-specific (e.g., labor provision) covariates are also available. The study focuses on two key challenges: (1) capturing multiple forms of temporal and network dependence, and dependence on covariates; and (2) accounting for potential trade volume as an important but partially observed edge-specific covariate, which is only available for country pairs that engaged in trade. To address these challenges, we introduce the dynamic hurdle network model (Hurdle-Net) for zero-inflated directed network time series that incorporates several novel features. First, it represents the time series as a paired binary and continuous time series and utilizes a hurdle model that effectively handles sparsity in edge occurrence. Second, the model captures evolving network dependencies using node-specific latent variables governed by a dynamic shrinkage process. Third, it leverages a shared latent structure across the binary and continuous components, reflecting the fact that both networks involve the same nodes. Finally, the model employs a generalized logistic link function to relate edge occurrence to edge weight, allowing for a parsimonious and coherent hierarchical Bayesian framework that jointly models both network components. Compared to static or independent models, Hurdle-Net provides improved model selection, estimation, and prediction performance for analyzing international trade patterns. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through simulation studies and an application to bilateral trade flow data.</p></details> |  |

We rigorously evaluate LATST across multiple real-world multivariate time series datasets, demonstrating its ability to outperform existing state-of-the-art Transformer models. Notably, LATST manages to achieve competitive performance with fewer parameters than some linear models on certain datasets, highlighting its efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages with referencing, 1 figure, 5 tables</p></details> |

Pulsatile waveforms offer probabilities for accurate artefact detection, yet most approaches rely on supervised manners and overlook patient-level distribution shifts. To address these issues, we introduce a generalised label-free framework, GenClean, for real-time artefact cleaning and leverage an in-house dataset of 180,000 ten-second arterial blood pressure (ABP) samples for training. We first investigate patient-level generalisation, demonstrating robust performances under both intra- and inter-patient distribution shifts. We further validate its effectiveness through challenging cross-disease cohort experiments on the MIMIC-III database. Additionally, we extend our method to photoplethysmography (PPG), highlighting its applicability to diverse medical pulsatile signals. Finally, its integration into ICM+, a clinical research monitoring software, confirms the real-time feasibility of our framework, emphasising its practical utility in continuous physiological monitoring. This work provides a foundational step toward precision medicine in improving the reliability of high-resolution medical time series analysis</p></details> |  |

Time-Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) is an important task in various time-series applications such as e-commerce, cybersecurity, vehicle maintenance, and healthcare monitoring. However, this task is very challenging as it requires considering both the intra-variable dependency (relationships within a variable over time) and the inter-variable dependency (relationships between multiple variables) existing in time-series data. Recent graph-based approaches have made impressive progress in tackling the challenges of this field. In this survey, we conduct a comprehensive and up-to-date review of TSAD using graphs, referred to as G-TSAD. First, we explore the significant potential of graph representation for time-series data and and its contributions to facilitating anomaly detection. Then, we review state-of-the-art graph anomaly detection techniques, mostly leveraging deep learning architectures, in the context of time series. For each method, we discuss its strengths, limitations, and the specific applications where it excels. Finally, we address both the technical and application challenges currently facing the field, and suggest potential future directions for advancing research and improving practical outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (IEEE TPAMI)</p></details> |

However, rapid advancements have produced a diversity of seemingly unrelated architectures, such as Transformers and recurrent alternatives. In this paper, we introduce a unifying framework to understand and derive these sequence models, inspired by the empirical importance of associative recall, the capability to retrieve contextually relevant tokens. We formalize associative recall as a two-step process, memorization and retrieval, casting memorization as a regression problem. Layers that combine these two steps perform associative recall via ``test-time regression'' over its input tokens. Prominent layers, including linear attention, state-space models, fast-weight programmers, online learners, and softmax attention, arise as special cases defined by three design choices: the regression weights, the regressor function class, and the test-time optimization algorithm. Our approach clarifies how linear attention fails to capture inter-token correlations and offers a mathematical justification for the empirical effectiveness of query-key normalization in softmax attention. Further, it illuminates unexplored regions within the design space, which we use to derive novel higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work bridges sequence modeling with classic regression methods, a field with extensive literature, paving the way for developing more powerful and theoretically principled architectures.</p></details> |  |

Existing assistive technologies, such as GPS-based navigation systems, AI-powered smart glasses, and sonar-equipped canes, often face limitations in real-time obstacle avoidance, precise localization, and adaptability to dynamic surroundings. To investigate potential solutions, we introduced PathFinder, a novel map-less navigation system that explores different models for understanding 2D images, including Vision Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and employs monocular depth estimation for free-path detection. Our approach integrates a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm on depth images to determine the longest obstacle-free path, ensuring optimal route selection while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted comparative evaluations against existing AI-powered navigation methods and performed a usability study with BLV participants. The results demonstrate that PathFinder achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-time responsiveness. Notably, it reduces mean absolute error (MAE) and improves decision-making speed in outdoor navigation compared to AI-based alternatives. Participant feedback emphasizes the system's usability and effectiveness in outside situations, but also identifies issues in complicated indoor locations and low-light conditions. Usability testing revealed that 73% of participants understood how to use the app in about a minute, and 80% praised its balance of accuracy, quick response, and overall convenience.</p></details> |  |

Due to the high throughput involved in GPU-based simulations, classical visualization approaches such as ones based on copying to RAM or storage are not feasible anymore, as they imply large memory transfers between GPU and CPU at each moment, reducing both computational performance and interactivity. Implementing real-time visualizers for GPU simulation codes is a challenging task as it involves dealing with i) low-level integration of graphics APIs (e.g, OpenGL and Vulkan) into the general-purpose GPU code, ii) a careful and efficient handling of memory spaces and iii) finding a balance between rendering and computing as both need the GPU resources. In this work we present M\`imir, a CUDA/Vulkan interoperability C++ library that allows users to add real-time 2D/3D visualization to CUDA codes with low programming effort. With M\`imir, researchers can leverage state-of-the-art CUDA/Vulkan interoperability features without needing to invest time in learning the complex low-level technical aspects involved. Internally, M\`imir streamlines the interoperability mapping between CUDA device memory containing simulation data and Vulkan graphics resources, so that changes on the data are instantly reflected in the visualization. This abstraction scheme allows generating visualizations with minimal alteration over the original source code, needing only to replace the GPU memory allocation lines of the data to be visualized by the API calls provided by M\`imir among other optional changes.</p></details> |  |

More specifically, we consider mixed Poisson INGARCH models and allow for dynamic modeling of the dispersion parameter (as well as the mean), similar to the spirit of the ordinary GARCH models. We derive conditions to obtain first and second-order stationarity, and ergodicity as well. Estimation of the parameters is addressed and their associated asymptotic properties are established as well. A restricted bootstrap procedure is proposed for testing constant dispersion against time-varying dispersion. Monte Carlo simulation studies are presented for checking point estimation, standard errors, and the performance of the restricted bootstrap approach. We apply the tv-DINGARCH process to model the weekly number of reported measles infections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, from January 2001 to May 2013, and compare its performance to the ordinary INGARCH approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper published in the Journal of Time Series Analysis.

This approach was applied in Metro Manila, National Capital Region, Philippines. Through dynamic time warping (DTW), the temporal alignment was quantified between network metrics and COVID-19 case trajectories, and systematically explored 320 parameter configurations including two network metrics (network density and clustering coefficient), two data preprocessing methods (Rescaling Daily Data and MSV), multiple thresholds, two correlation window sizes, and Sakoe-Chiba band constraints. Results from the Kruskal-Wallis tests revealed that five of the six parameters significantly influenced alignment quality, with the disease comparison type (active cases vs. confirmed cases) demonstrating the strongest effect. The optimal configuration, which is using the network density statistic with a Rescaling Daily Data transformation, a threshold of 0.8, a 15-day window, and a 50-day radius constraint, achieved a DTW score of 36.30. This indicated substantial temporal alignment with the COVID-19 confirmed cases data. The discoveries demonstrate that network metrics rooted from online search behavior can serve as complementary indicators for epidemic surveillance in urban locations like Metro Manila. This strategy leverages the Philippines' extensive online usage during the pandemic to provide potentially valuable early signals of disease spread, and offers a supplementary tool for public health monitoring in resource-limited situations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted and currently under review at the IEEE AMLDS 2025</p></details> |

This breaks the long-standing $\Omega(n)$-update-time barrier on dense graphs, achievable by trivially scanning all incident vertices of the updated edge, and affirmatively answers a major open question repeatedly asked in the literature [BGS15, BCHN18, Sol22]. We also present a faster randomized algorithm against an adaptive adversary with $\tilde{O}(n^{3/4})$ amortized update time. Our approach employs the edge degree constrained subgraph (EDCS), a central object for optimizing approximation ratio, in a completely novel way; we instead use it for maintaining a matching that matches all high degree vertices in sublinear update time so that it remains to handle low degree vertices rather straightforwardly. To optimize this approach, we employ tools never used in the dynamic matching literature prior to our work, including sublinear-time algorithms for matching high degree vertices, random walks on directed expanders, and the monotone Even-Shiloach tree for dynamic shortest paths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Initi...</summary><p>Initially appeared at STOC25</p></details> |

In contrast to standard congestion games where agents interact in a one-shot fashion, in our model each agent chooses an infinite sequence of actions and maximizes the total reward stream discounted over time under different ways of computing present values. Our model assumes that actions consume common resources that get congested, and the action choice by an agent affects the completion times of actions chosen by other agents, which in turn affects the time rewards are accrued and their discounted value. This is a mean-field game, where an agent's reward depends on the decisions of the other agents through the resulting action completion times. For this type of game we define stationary equilibria, and analyze their existence and price of anarchy (PoA). Overall, we find that the PoA depends entirely on the type of discounting rather than its specific parameters. For exponential discounting, myopic behaviour leads to extreme inefficiency: the PoA is infinity for any value of the discount parameter. For power law discounting, such inefficiency is greatly reduced and the PoA is 2 whenever stationary equilibria exist. This matches the PoA when there is no discounting and players maximize long-run average rewards. Additionally, we observe that exponential discounting may introduce unstable equilibria in learning algorithms, if action completion times are interdependent. In contrast, under no discounting all equilibria are stable.</p></details> |  |

The proposed change detection framework (CDF) strategically combines the advantages of entropy analysis (EA) and principle component analysis (PCA) with fuzzy clustering procedures. In the framework, EA is applied for dynamic selection of features for reduction of the feature space and increase of computational performance. Furthermore, PCA is utilized to extract features from the raw feature space to enable generalization capability of the subsequent fuzzy clustering procedures. Three different fuzzy clustering methods, more precisely the fuzzy clustering algorithm, a probabilistic clustering algorithm and a possibilistic clustering algorithm are evaluated for performance and generalization. Hence, the proposed framework has the innovative feature to detect changes in pump current time series at an early stage for arbitrary points of operation, compared to state-of-the-art predefined alarms in commercially used EDFAs. Moreover, the approach is implemented and tested using experimental data. In addition, the proposed framework enables further approaches of applying decentralized predictive maintenance for optical fiber networks.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

In aerial image detection, while many existing methods have partially addressed the issue of small target detection, challenges remain in optimizing small target detection and balancing detection accuracy with efficiency. These issues are key obstacles to the advancement of real-time aerial image detection. In this paper, we propose a new family of real-time detectors for aerial image detection, named FBRT-YOLO, to address the imbalance between detection accuracy and efficiency. Our method comprises two lightweight modules: Feature Complementary Mapping Module (FCM) and Multi-Kernel Perception Unit(MKP), designed to enhance object perception for small targets in aerial images. FCM focuses on alleviating the problem of information imbalance caused by the loss of small target information in deep networks. It aims to integrate spatial positional information of targets more deeply into the network,better aligning with semantic information in the deeper layers to improve the localization of small targets. We introduce MKP, which leverages convolutions with kernels of different sizes to enhance the relationships between targets of various scales and improve the perception of targets at different scales. Extensive experimental results on three major aerial image datasets, including Visdrone, UAVDT, and AI-TOD,demonstrate that FBRT-YOLO outperforms various real-time detectors in terms of performance and speed.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

However, conventional chatbots with passive response mechanisms usually rely on users to initiate or sustain dialogues by bringing up new topics, resulting in diminished engagement and shortened dialogue duration. In this paper, we present PaRT, a novel framework enabling context-aware proactive dialogues for social chatbots through personalized real-time retrieval and generation. Specifically, PaRT first integrates user profiles and dialogue context into a large language model (LLM), which is initially prompted to refine user queries and recognize their underlying intents for the upcoming conversation. Guided by refined intents, the LLM generates personalized dialogue topics, which then serve as targeted queries to retrieve relevant passages from RedNote. Finally, we prompt LLMs with summarized passages to generate knowledge-grounded and engagement-optimized responses. Our approach has been running stably in a real-world production environment for more than 30 days, achieving a 21.77\% improvement in the average duration of dialogues.</p></details> |  |

For this reason, over time, several frameworks for quadrupedal locomotion have been proposed, but with little attention to ensuring a predictable timing behavior of the controller. To address this issue, this work presents Feelbert, a modular control framework for quadrupedal locomotion suitable for execution on an embedded system under hard real-time execution constraints. It leverages the feedback linearization control technique to obtain a closed-form control law for the body, valid for all configurations of the robot. The control law was derived after defining an appropriate rigid body model that uses the accelerations of the feet as control variables, instead of the estimated contact forces. This work also provides a novel algorithm to compute footholds and gait temporal parameters using the concept of imaginary wheels, and a heuristic algorithm to select the best gait schedule for the current velocity commands. The proposed framework is developed entirely in C++, with no dependencies on third-party libraries and no dynamic memory allocation, to ensure predictability and real-time performance. Its implementation allows Feelbert to be both compiled and executed on an embedded system for critical applications, as well as integrated into larger systems such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). For this reason, Feelbert has been tested in both scenarios, demonstrating satisfactory results both in terms of reference tracking and temporal predictability, whether integrated into ROS 2 or compiled as a standalone application on a Raspberry Pi 5.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

TOAST deploys timing constraints to regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety. We provide a new behavioural semantics for TOAST which guarantees progress in the presence of mixed-choice.

First, the regularity of the solution to the considered problem is investigated, finding that its first-order time derivative exhibits singularity at $t=0^+$ and its second-order time derivative shows singularity at both $t=0^+$ and $\tau^+$, while the solution can be decomposed into its singular and regular components. Then, we derive a fully discrete finite element scheme to solve the considered problem based on the standard Galerkin finite element method in space and the Gr\"unwald-Letnikov type approximation in time. The analysis shows that the developed numerical scheme is stable. In order to discuss the error estimate, a new discrete Gronwall inequality is established. Under the above decomposition of the solution, we obtain a local error estimate in time for the developed numerical scheme. Finally, some numerical tests are provided to support our theoretical analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, the systematic synthesis of DTCBFs in a computationally efficient way is at present an important open problem. This article first proposes a novel alternating-descent approach based on Sum-of-Squares programming to synthesize quadratic DTCBFs and corresponding polynomial control policies for discrete-time control-affine polynomial systems with input constraints and semi-algebraic safe sets. Subsequently, two distinct approaches are introduced to extend the proposed method to the synthesis of higher-degree polynomial DTCBFs. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.</p></details> |  |

In the literature, ECG, actigraphy, speech, voice, and facial analysis have proven effective at detecting patients' emotions. On the other hand, these tools are invasive and do not integrate smoothly into the patient's daily life. HRV has also been proven to effectively indicate stress conditions, especially in combination with other signals. However, when HRV is derived from less invasive devices than the ECG, like wristbands and smartwatches, the quality of measurements significantly degrades. This paper presents a methodology for stress detection from a wristband based on a universal model for time series, UniTS, which we finetuned for the task and equipped with explainability features. We cast the problem as anomaly detection rather than classification to favor model adaptation to individual patients and allow the clinician to maintain greater control over the system's predictions. We demonstrate that our proposed model considerably surpasses 12 top-performing methods on three benchmark datasets. Furthermore, unlike other state-of-the-art systems, UniTS enables seamless monitoring, as it shows comparable performance when using signals from invasive or lightweight devices.</p></details> | 38 pages, 10 figures |

Although traditional medical image fusion methods have made progress in improving fusion accuracy, they still face significant challenges in real-time performance, fine-grained feature extraction, and edge preservation.In this paper, we introduce TTTFusion, a Test-Time Training (TTT)-based image fusion strategy that dynamically adjusts model parameters during inference to efficiently fuse multimodal medical images. By adapting the model during the test phase, our method optimizes the parameters based on the input image data, leading to improved accuracy and better detail preservation in the fusion results.Experimental results demonstrate that TTTFusion significantly enhances the fusion quality of multimodal images compared to traditional fusion methods, particularly in fine-grained feature extraction and edge preservation. This approach not only improves image fusion accuracy but also offers a novel technical solution for real-time image processing in surgical robots.</p></details> |  |

This error process is often assumed to follow a stationary autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, or its seasonal variants, which is unable to capture a long-range dependence structure (long memory) of the error process. We propose a novel dynamic linear regression model that incorporates the long-range dependence feature of the errors and show that the proposed error process may: (i) have a significant impact on the posterior uncertainty of the estimated regression parameters and (ii) improve the model's forecasting ability. We develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo method to fit general dynamic linear regression models based on a frequency domain approach that enables fast, asymptotically exact Bayesian inference for large datasets. We demonstrate that our approximate algorithm is faster than the traditional time domain approaches, such as the Kalman filter and the multivariate Gaussian likelihood, while producing a highly accurate approximation to the posterior. The method is illustrated in simulated examples and two energy forecasting applications.</p></details> |  |

Using existing algorithms for computing regularity decompositions of sparse graphs in (randomized) near-linear time, and appropriate choices for the constant-sized inner/base codes, we prove the following: - Expander-based codes constructed using the distance amplification technique of Alon, Edmonds and Luby [FOCS 1995] with rate $\rho$, can be list decoded to a radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time. By known results, the output list has size $O(1/\epsilon)$. - The above codes of Alon, Edmonds and Luby, with rate $\rho$, can also be list recovered to radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists. - The Tanner code construction of Sipser and Spielman [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1996] with distance $\delta$, can be list decoded to radius $\delta - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists. Our results imply novel combinatorial as well as algorithmic bounds for each of the above explicit constructions. All of these bounds are obtained via combinatorial rigidity phenomena, proved using (weak) graph regularity. The regularity framework allows us to lift the list decoding and list recovery properties for the local base codes, to the global codes obtained via the above constructions.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike classical code, quantum programs must be compiled before each execution, making the trade-off between compilation time and execution time particularly significant. In this paper, we address the first step of quantum compilation: multi-qubit gate decomposition. We analyze the trade-offs of state-of-the-art decomposition algorithms by implementing them in the Ket quantum programming platform and collecting numerical performance data. This is the first study to both implement and analyze the current state-of-the-art decomposition methods within a single platform. Based on our findings, we propose two compilation profiles: one optimized for minimizing compilation time and another for minimizing quantum execution time. Our results provide valuable insights for both quantum compiler developers and quantum programmers, helping them make informed decisions about gate decomposition strategies and their impact on overall performance.</p></details> |  |

We distinguish between two cases: (i) If $F$ is determined by a finite partition of $X$ we derive a lower bound that depends on the dynamical measure-theoretic entropy of the partition. (ii) We consider general finite-dimensional subspaces $F$ and establish a lower bound for the dimension of $F$ that is contingent on the spectral structure of the Koopman operator of the system, via the approximation entropy of $F$ as studied by Voiculescu. Furthermore, we motivate the use of delay observables to improve the predictive qualities of Dynamic Mode Decomposition algorithms.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Neural Operators such as the Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) and the Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) have demonstrated excellent generalization properties when mapping between spatial function spaces. However, they struggle in mapping the temporal dynamics of time-dependent PDEs, especially for time steps not explicitly seen during training. This limits their temporal accuracy as they do not leverage these dynamics in the training process. In addition, most NOs tend to be prohibitively costly to train, especially for higher-dimensional PDEs. In this paper, we propose the Temporal Neural Operator (TNO), an efficient neural operator specifically designed for spatio-temporal operator learning for time-dependent PDEs. TNO achieves this by introducing a temporal-branch to the DeepONet framework, leveraging the best architectural design choices from several other NOs, and a combination of training strategies including Markov assumption, teacher forcing, temporal bundling, and the flexibility to condition the output on the current state or past states. Through extensive benchmarking and an ablation study on a diverse set of example problems we demonstrate the TNO long range temporal extrapolation capabilities, robustness to error accumulation, resolution invariance, and flexibility to handle multiple input functions.</p></details> |  |

The interval type 2 fuzzy neural network (IT2FNN) has shown exceptional performance in uncertainty modelling for single-step prediction tasks. However, extending it for multi-step ahead predictions introduces further issues in uncertainty handling as well as model interpretability and accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a new selforganizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO). Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer network architecture is developed. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model for multi-step time series prediction problems. Second, a new link layer is created to improve the accuracy by building temporal connections between multi-step predictions. Third, a new transformation layer is designed to address the problem of the vanishing rule strength caused by high-dimensional inputs. Furthermore, a two-stage, self-organizing learning mechanism is developed to automatically extract fuzzy rules from data and optimize network parameters. Experimental results on chaotic and microgrid prediction problems demonstrate that SOIT2FNN-MO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, by achieving a better accuracy ranging from 1.6% to 30% depending on the level of noises in data. Additionally, the proposed model is more interpretable, offering deeper insights into the prediction process.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Longitudinal Health, Income and Employment Model (LHIEM), a path-dependent discrete-time microsimulation that predicts annual health care expenditures, family income, and health status for the U.S. population over a multi-year period. LHIEM advances the population from year to year as a Markov chain with modules capturing the particular dynamics of each predictive attribute. LHIEM was designed to assess a health care financing proposal that would allow individuals to borrow from the U.S. government to cover health care costs, requiring careful tracking of medical expenditures and medical debt over time. However, LHIEM is flexible enough to be used for a range of modeling needs related to predicting health care spending and income over time. In this paper, we present the details of the model and all dynamic modules, and include a case study to demonstrate how LHIEM can be used to evaluate proposed policy changes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation, 2025</p></details> |

Time-varying mining rates are considered to capture the intrinsic characteristics of the peer to peer network delays as well as dynamic participation of miners such as the gap game and switching between different cryptocurrencies. Ruin theory is leveraged to obtain the double spend probabilities and numerical examples are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CHIL 2025.

Since these graphs extend over infinitely many time steps, deciding whether causal effects across arbitrary time intervals are identifiable appears to require computation on graph segments of unbounded size. Even for deciding the identifiability of intervention effects on variables that are close in time, no bound is known on how many time steps in the past need to be considered. We give a first bound of this kind that only depends on the number of variables per time step and the maximum time lag of any direct or latent causal effect. More generally, we show that applying the Causal Identification algorithm to a constant-size segment of the time series graph is sufficient to decide identifiability of causal effects, even across unbounded time intervals.</p></details> |  |

By using the robust capabilities of the MediaPipe as a computer vision library and the DeepFace as an emotion recognition library, this research endeavors to capture the subtleties of human head motion, including blink actions and emotional expressions, and seamlessly incorporate these indicators into the robot's responses. The result is a comprehensive framework which facilitates precise head imitation within human-robot interactions, utilizing a closed-loop approach that involves gathering real-time feedback from the robot's imitation performance. This feedback loop ensures a high degree of accuracy in modeling head motion, as evidenced by an impressive R2 score of 96.3 for pitch and 98.9 for yaw. Notably, the proposed approach holds promise in improving communication for children with autism, offering them a valuable tool for more effective interaction. In essence, proposed work explores the integration of real-time head imitation and real-time emotion recognition to enhance human-robot interactions, with potential benefits for individuals with unique communication needs.</p></details> |  |

The first lower bound is for the setting where the type-1 error level $\alpha$ approaches zero, and equals $\log(1/\alpha)$ divided by a certain infimum KL divergence, termed $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$. The second lower bound applies to the setting where $\alpha$ is fixed and $\operatorname{KL_{inf}}$ approaches 0 (meaning that the null and alternative sets are not separated) and equals $c \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1} \log \log \operatorname{KL_{inf}}^{-1}$ for a universal constant $c > 0$. We also provide a sufficient condition for matching the upper bounds and show that this condition is met in several special cases. Given past work, these upper and lower bounds are unsurprising in their form; our main contribution is the generality in which they hold, for example, not requiring reference measures or compactness of the classes.</p></details> | 36 pages |

The model features bivariate coefficient surfaces to represent relationships across panel dimensions, with sparsity introduced via penalized smoothing and group bridge regression. This enables simultaneous estimation of the surfaces and identification of significant inter-dimensional effects. Through Monte Carlo simulations and an empirical application to Japanese subnational age-specific mortality rates, we demonstrate the proposed model's superior forecasting performance and interpretability compared to existing functional time series approaches.</p></details> |  |

Over the past two decades, researchers have extended these methods to analyze trajectories of humans, animals, and vehicles, studying their behavior and movement across applications. This paper presents whole-trajectory clustering and sub-trajectory clustering algorithms based on DBSCAN line segment clustering, which encompasses two key events: split and merge of line segments. The events are employed by object movement history and the average Euclidean distance between line segments. In this framework, whole-trajectory clustering considers entire entities' trajectories, whereas sub-trajectory clustering employs a sliding window model to identify similar sub-trajectories. Many existing trajectory clustering algorithms respond to temporary anomalies in data by splitting trajectories, which often obscures otherwise consistent clustering patterns and leads to less reliable insights. We introduce the stable trajectory clustering algorithm, which leverages the mean absolute deviation concept to demonstrate that selective omission of transient deviations not only preserves the integrity of clusters but also improves their stability and interpretability. We run all proposed algorithms on real trajectory datasets to illustrate their effectiveness and sensitivity to parameter variations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing agents need to collect a large number of expert data for fine-tuning to adapt to new environments. In this paper, we propose an online self-exploration method for multimodal agents, namely SPORT, via step-wise preference optimization to refine the trajectories of agents, which automatically generates tasks and learns from solving the generated tasks, without any expert annotation. SPORT operates through four iterative components: task synthesis, step sampling, step verification, and preference tuning. First, we synthesize multi-modal tasks using language models. Then, we introduce a novel search scheme, where step sampling and step verification are executed alternately to solve each generated task. We employ a verifier to provide AI feedback to construct step-wise preference data. The data is subsequently used to update the controller's policy through preference tuning, producing a SPORT Agent. By interacting with real environments, the SPORT Agent evolves into a more refined and capable system. Evaluation in the GTA and GAIA benchmarks show that the SPORT Agent achieves 6.41\% and 3.64\% improvements, underscoring the generalization and effectiveness introduced by our method.

Despite their utility in advancing digital automation, a critical bottleneck persists: collecting high-quality trajectory data for training. Common practices for collecting such data rely on human supervision or synthetic data generation through executing pre-defined tasks, which are either resource-intensive or unable to guarantee data quality. Moreover, these methods suffer from limited data diversity and significant gaps between synthetic data and real-world environments. To address these challenges, we propose OS-Genesis, a novel GUI data synthesis pipeline that reverses the conventional trajectory collection process. Instead of relying on pre-defined tasks, OS-Genesis enables agents first to perceive environments and perform step-wise interactions, then retrospectively derive high-quality tasks to enable trajectory-level exploration. A trajectory reward model is then employed to ensure the quality of the generated trajectories. We demonstrate that training GUI agents with OS-Genesis significantly improves their performance on highly challenging online benchmarks. In-depth analysis further validates OS-Genesis's efficiency and its superior data quality and diversity compared to existing synthesis methods. Our codes, data, and checkpoints are available at https://qiushisun.github.io/OS-Genesis-Home/.</p></details> | Work in progress |

In this setup, measurement (output) uncertainties are state-dependent and set-valued. Enveloping ellipsoids are employed to characterize state-dependent uncertainties with unknown distributions. The concept of regularity for set-valued output maps is then introduced, facilitating the formulation of the estimation-aware trajectory generation problem. Specifically, it is demonstrated that for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to the finite horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, estimation-aware trajectories can then be synthesized for a broad class of systems. Trajectory planning routines are also examined in this work, by which the observability measure is optimized for systems with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, representative examples in the context of trajectory planning with vision-based estimation are presented. Moreover, the paper presents estimation-aware planning for an uncooperative Target-Rendezvous problem, where an Ego-satellite employs an onboard machine learning (ML)-based estimation module to realize the rendezvous trajectory.</p></details> | 40 pages, 9 figures |

Traditional detection-assignment tracking methods struggle with false positives, false negatives, and frequent identity switches, leading to degraded counting accuracy and making in-depth analysis impossible. This paper introduces a point-oriented online tracking algorithm that improves trajectory continuity and counting reliability in drone-based crowd monitoring. Our method builds on the Simple Online and Real-time Tracking (SORT) framework, replacing the original bounding-box assignment with a point-distance metric. The algorithm is enhanced with three cost-effective techniques: camera motion compensation, altitude-aware assignment, and classification-based trajectory validation. Further, Deep Discriminative Correlation Filters (DDCF) that re-use spatial feature maps from localisation algorithms for increased computational efficiency through neural network resource sharing are integrated to refine object tracking by reducing noise and handling missed detections. The proposed method is evaluated on the DroneCrowd and newly shared UP-COUNT-TRACK datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in tracking metrics, reducing counting errors to 23% and 15%, respectively. The results also indicate a significant reduction of identity switches while maintaining high tracking accuracy, outperforming baseline online trackers and even an offline greedy optimisation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to the Expert Systems with Applications journal</p></details> |

Simultaneous control and trajectory estimation using probabilistic graphical models has been proposed as a unified solution to these challenges. Previous work, however, relies heavily on appropriate Gaussian priors and is limited to holonomic robots with linear time-varying models. The current research extends graphical optimization methods to vehicles with arbitrary dynamical models via Simultaneous Trajectory Estimation and Local Adaptation (STELA). The overall approach initializes feasible trajectories using a kinodynamic, sampling-based motion planner. Then, it simultaneously: (i) estimates the past trajectory based on noisy observations, and (ii) adapts the controls to be executed to minimize deviations from the planned, feasible trajectory, while avoiding collisions. The proposed factor graph representation of trajectories in STELA can be applied for any dynamical system given access to first or second-order state update equations, and introduces the duration of execution between two states in the trajectory discretization as an optimization variable. These features provide both generalization and flexibility in trajectory following. In addition to targeting computational efficiency, the proposed strategy performs incremental updates of the factor graph using the iSAM algorithm and introduces a time-window mechanism. This mechanism allows the factor graph to be dynamically updated to operate over a limited history and forward horizon of the planned trajectory. This enables online updates of controls at a minimum of 10Hz. Experiments demonstrate that STELA achieves at least comparable performance to previous frameworks on idealized vehicles with linear dynamics.[...]</p></details> | [Accepted] RSS 2025 |

While, the spin is not directly observable in standard broadcasting videos, we show that it can be inferred from the ball's trajectory in the video. We present a novel method to infer the initial spin and 3D trajectory from the corresponding 2D trajectory in a video. Without ground truth labels for broadcast videos, we train a neural network solely on synthetic data. Due to the choice of our input data representation, physically correct synthetic training data, and using targeted augmentations, the network naturally generalizes to real data. Notably, these simple techniques are sufficient to achieve generalization. No real data at all is required for training. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to present a method for spin and trajectory prediction in simple monocular broadcast videos, achieving an accuracy of 92.0% in spin classification and a 2D reprojection error of 0.19% of the image diagonal.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW)</p></details> |

However, existing methods face robotic hardware dependency and control frequency mismatches between teleoperation devices and robotic platforms. Our approach automatically extracts kinematic parameters from unified robot description format (URDF) files, and enables pluggable deployment across diverse robots through uniform interfaces. The proposed interpolation algorithm bridges the frequency gap between low-rate human inputs and high-frequency robotic control commands through online continuous trajectory generation, \n{while requiring no access to the closed, bottom-level control loop}. To enhance trajectory smoothness, we introduce a minimum-stretch spline that optimizes the motion quality. The system further provides precision and rapid modes to accommodate different task requirements.

Existing deep generative models learn from real trajectories to generate synthetic ones. Despite the progress, most of them suffer from training stability issues and scale poorly with increasing data size. More importantly, they often lack control mechanisms to guide the generated trajectories under constraints such as enforcing specific visits. To address these limitations, we formally define the controlled trajectory generation problem for effectively handling multiple spatiotemporal constraints. We introduce Geo-Llama, a novel LLM finetuning framework that can enforce multiple explicit visit constraints while maintaining contextual coherence of the generated trajectories. In this approach, pre-trained LLMs are fine-tuned on trajectory data with a visit-wise permutation strategy where each visit corresponds to a specific time and location. This strategy enables the model to capture spatiotemporal patterns regardless of visit orders while maintaining flexible and in-context constraint integration through prompts during generation. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of Geo-Llama, demonstrating its versatility and robustness in handling a broad range of constraints to generate more realistic trajectories compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Traditional modular methods suffer from error propagation, while existing end-to-end models typically employ static one-shot inference paradigms that inadequately capture the dynamic changes of the environment. ARTEMIS takes a different method by generating trajectory waypoints sequentially, preserves critical temporal dependencies while dynamically routing scene-specific queries to specialized expert networks. It effectively relieves trajectory quality degradation issues encountered when guidance information is ambiguous, and overcomes the inherent representational limitations of singular network architectures when processing diverse driving scenarios. Additionally, we use a lightweight batch reallocation strategy that significantly improves the training speed of the Mixture-of-Experts model. Through experiments on the NAVSIM dataset, ARTEMIS exhibits superior competitive performance, achieving 87.0 PDMS and 83.1 EPDMS with ResNet-34 backbone, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on multiple metrics.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this, an end-to-end foot trajectory and force optimization framework (FTFOF) is proposed, which optimizes foot adhesion and detachment forces through trajectory adjustments. This framework accepts general foot trajectory constraints and user-defined parameters as input, ultimately producing an optimal single foot trajectory. It integrates three-segment $C^2$ continuous Bezier curves, tailored to various foot structures, enabling the generation of effective climbing trajectories. A dilate-based GRU predictive model establishes the relationship between foot trajectories and the corresponding foot forces. Multi-objective optimization algorithms, combined with a redundancy hierarchical strategy, identify the most suitable foot trajectory for specific tasks, thereby ensuring optimal performance across detachment force, adhesion force and vibration amplitude. Experimental validation on the quadruped climbing robot MST-M3F showed that, compared to commonly used trajectories in existing legged climbing robots, the proposed framework achieved reductions in maximum detachment force by 28 \%, vibration amplitude by 82 \%, which ensures the stable climbing of dry adhesion legged climbing robots.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IFAC for publication under a Creative Commons Licence CC-BY-NC-ND</p></details> |

Therefore, fin-driven autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) can achieve high maneuverability with a smaller number of actuators, but their control is challenging. This study proposes an analytic control allocation method for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs). By integrating an adaptive hybrid feedback controller, we enable an AUV with 4 actuators to move in 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) in simulation and up to 5-DOF in real-world experiments. The proposed method outperformed state-of-the-art control allocation techniques in 6-DOF trajectory tracking simulations, exhibiting centimeter-scale accuracy and higher energy and computational efficiency. Real-world pool experiments confirmed the method's robustness and efficacy in tracking complex 3D trajectories, with significant computational efficiency gains 0.007 (ms) vs. 22.28 (ms). Our method offers a balance between performance, energy efficiency, and computational efficiency, showcasing a potential avenue for more effective tracking of a large number of DOF for under-actuated underwater robots.</p></details> |  |

These seek to answer a fundamental question: What can we learn from time series measurements of a complex dynamical system? For small systems interacting with external environments, the effective dynamics are inherently stochastic, making it crucial to properly manage noise in data. Here, we explore this for systems obeying Langevin dynamics and, using currents, we construct a learning framework for stochastic modeling. Currents have recently gained increased attention for their role in bounding entropy production (EP) from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs). We introduce a fundamental relationship between the cumulant currents there and standard machine-learning loss functions. Using this, we derive loss functions for several key thermodynamic functions directly from the system dynamics without the (common) intermediate step of deriving a TUR. These loss functions reproduce results derived both from TURs and other methods. More significantly, they open a path to discover new loss functions for previously inaccessible quantities. Notably, this includes access to per-trajectory entropy production, even if the observed system is driven far from its steady-state. We also consider higher order estimation. Our method is straightforward and unifies dynamic inference with recent approaches to entropy production estimation. Taken altogether, this reveals a deep connection between diffusion models in machine learning and entropy production estimation in stochastic thermodynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 appendices (10 pages), 4 figures; https://csc.ucdavis.edu/~cmg/compmech/pubs/currents.htm</p></details> |

These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

While these methods achieve exceptional performance in defined datasets, they usually rely on the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption and thus tend to be vulnerable to distribution shifts that occur in the real world. In addition, these methods lack explainability due to their black box nature, which poses further challenges in terms of the approval process and social trustworthiness. Therefore, in order to use the capabilities of data-driven statistical AI methods in a reliable and trustworthy manner, the concept of TrustMHE is introduced and investigated in this paper. TrustMHE represents a complementary approach, independent of the underlying AI systems, that combines AI-driven out-of-distribution detection with control-driven moving horizon estimation (MHE) to enable not only detection and monitoring, but also intervention.

While many data-driven approaches aim to learn system dynamics, jointly predicting internal loads and system trajectories remains a key challenge. This dual prediction is especially important for fault detection and predictive maintenance, where internal loads-such as contact forces-act as early indicators of faults, reflecting wear or misalignment before affecting motion. These forces also serve as inputs to degradation models (e.g., crack growth), enabling damage prediction and remaining useful life estimation. We propose Equi-Euler GraphNet, a physics-informed graph neural network (GNN) that simultaneously predicts internal forces and global trajectories in multi-body systems. In this mesh-free framework, nodes represent system components and edges encode interactions. Equi-Euler GraphNet introduces two inductive biases: (1) an equivariant message-passing scheme, interpreting edge messages as interaction forces consistent under Euclidean transformations; and (2) a temporal-aware iterative node update mechanism, based on Euler integration, to capture influence of distant interactions over time. Tailored for cylindrical roller bearings, it decouples ring dynamics from constrained motion of rolling elements. Trained on high-fidelity multiphysics simulations, Equi-Euler GraphNet generalizes beyond the training distribution, accurately predicting loads and trajectories under unseen speeds, loads, and configurations. It outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs focused on trajectory prediction, delivering stable rollouts over thousands of time steps with minimal error accumulation. Achieving up to a 200x speedup over conventional solvers while maintaining comparable accuracy, it serves as an efficient reduced-order model for digital twins, design, and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reupl...</summary><p>Reuploaded with new version-- equation 16 was incorrect</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel mixed Bernstein-Fourier approximation framework tailored explicitly for optimal motion planning. Our proposed methodology leverages the uniform convergence properties of Bernstein polynomials for nonperiodic behaviors while effectively capturing periodic dynamics through Fourier series. Theoretical results are established, including uniform convergence proofs for approximations of functions, derivatives, and integrals, as well as detailed error bound analyses. We further introduce a regulated least squares approach for determining approximation coefficients, enhancing numerical stability and practical applicability. Within an optimal control context, we establish feasibility and consistency of approximated solutions to their continuous counterparts. We also extend the covector mapping theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for approximating dual variables crucial in verifying the necessary optimality conditions from Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Comprehensive numerical examples illustrate the method's superior performance, demonstrating substantial improvements in computational efficiency and precision in scenarios with complex periodic constraints and dynamics. Our mixed Bernstein-Fourier methodology thus presents a robust, theoretically grounded, and computationally efficient approach for advanced optimal trajectory planning in autonomous systems.</p></details> | 49 pages, 9 figures |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods.

Operating in such settings presents many challenges -- most notably, because the agent cannot predict the ground-truth future paths of obstacles, a previously planned trajectory can become unsafe at any moment, requiring rapid replanning to avoid collisions. Recently developed planners have used soft-constraint approaches to achieve the necessary fast computation times; however, these methods do not guarantee collision-free paths even with static obstacles. In contrast, hard-constraint methods ensure collision-free safety, but typically have longer computation times. To address these issues, we propose three key contributions. First, the DYNUS Global Planner (DGP) and Temporal Safe Corridor Generation operate in spatio-temporal space and handle both static and dynamic obstacles in the 3D environment. Second, the Safe Planning Framework leverages a combination of exploratory, safe, and contingency trajectories to flexibly re-route when potential future collisions with dynamic obstacles are detected. Finally, the Fast Hard-Constraint Local Trajectory Formulation uses a variable elimination approach to reduce the problem size and enable faster computation by pre-computing dependencies between free and dependent variables while still ensuring collision-free trajectories. We evaluated DYNUS in a variety of simulations, including dense forests, confined office spaces, cave systems, and dynamic environments. Our experiments show that DYNUS achieves a success rate of 100% and travel times that are approximately 25.0% faster than state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluated DYNUS on multiple platforms -- a quadrotor, a wheeled robot, and a quadruped -- in both simulation and hardware experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 30 figures, Under review at IEEE Transactions on Robotics</p></details> |

There is a urgent need to minimize the data size in LLM training. Compared with data selection method, the data distillation method aims to synthesize a small number of data samples to achieve the training effect of the full data set and has better flexibility. Despite its successes in computer vision, the discreteness of text data has hitherto stymied its exploration in natural language processing (NLP). In this work, we proposed a method that involves learning pseudo prompt data based on trajectory matching and finding its nearest neighbor ID to achieve cross-architecture transfer. During the distillation process, we introduce a regularization loss to improve the robustness of our distilled data. To our best knowledge, this is the first data distillation work suitable for text generation tasks such as instruction tuning. Evaluations on two benchmarks, including ARC-Easy and MMLU instruction tuning datasets, established the superiority of our distillation approach over the SOTA data selection method LESS. Furthermore, our method demonstrates a good transferability over LLM structures (i.e., OPT to Llama).</p></details> |  |

Our framework begins by generating panoptic occupancy local semantic maps and accurate localization information from data aligned between a monocular camera, IMU, and GPS. This information is combined with input terrain point clouds or preloaded terrain information to initialize the planning process. We propose the Radiant Field-Informed Coverage Planning algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion field model to dynamically adjust the robot's coverage trajectory and speed based on environmental attributes such as dirtiness and dryness. By modeling the spatial influence of the robot's actions using a Gaussian field, ensures a speed-optimized, uniform coverage trajectory while adapting to varying environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

Even well-trained machine learning models may produce unreliable predictions due to discrepancies between training data and real-world conditions encountered during inference. In particular, the training dataset tends to overrepresent common scenes (e.g., straight lanes) while underrepresenting less frequent ones (e.g., traffic circles). In addition, it often overlooks unpredictable real-world events such as sudden braking or falling objects. To ensure safety, it is critical to detect in real-time when a model's predictions become unreliable. Leveraging the intuition that in-distribution (ID) scenes exhibit error patterns similar to training data, while out-of-distribution (OOD) scenes do not, we introduce a principled, real-time approach for OOD detection by framing it as a change-point detection problem. We address the challenging settings where the OOD scenes are deceptive, meaning that they are not easily detectable by human intuitions. Our lightweight solutions can handle the occurrence of OOD at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

In practice, safety constraints, including cost functions and budgets, are unknown or hard to specify, as it requires anticipation of all possible unsafe behaviors. We therefore address a general setting where the true safety definition is unknown, and has to be learned from sparsely labeled data. Our key contributions are: first, we design a safety model that performs credit assignment to estimate each decision step's impact on the overall safety using a dataset of diverse trajectories and their corresponding binary safety labels (i.e., whether the corresponding trajectory is safe/unsafe). Second, we illustrate the architecture of our safety model to demonstrate its ability to learn a separate safety score for each timestep. Third, we reformulate the safe RL problem using the proposed safety model and derive an effective algorithm to optimize a safe yet rewarding policy. Finally, our empirical results corroborate our findings and show that this approach is effective in satisfying unknown safety definition, and scalable to various continuous control tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SILM: A Subjective Intent Based Low-Latency Framework for Multiple Traffic Participants Joint Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16377v1)** | 2025-04-23 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.16377v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a fundamental technology for advanced autonomous driving systems and represents one of the most challenging problems in the field of cognitive intelligence. Accurately predicting the future trajectories of each traffic participant is a prerequisite for building high safety and high reliability decision-making, planning, and control capabilities in autonomous driving. However, existing methods often focus solely on the motion of other traffic participants without considering the underlying intent behind that motion, which increases the uncertainty in trajectory prediction. Autonomous vehicles operate in real-time environments, meaning that trajectory prediction algorithms must be able to process data and generate predictions in real-time. While many existing methods achieve high accuracy, they often struggle to effectively handle heterogeneous traffic scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Subjective Intent-based Low-latency framework for Multiple traffic participants joint trajectory prediction. Our method explicitly incorporates the subjective intent of traffic participants based on their key points, and predicts the future trajectories jointly without map, which ensures promising performance while significantly reducing the prediction latency. Additionally, we introduce a novel dataset designed specifically for trajectory prediction. Related code and dataset will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

As this is a novel task, there is currently no relevant dataset available in the community. To address this gap, we first devised a new visualization language called Trajectory Visualization Language (TVL) to facilitate querying trajectory data and generating visualizations. Building on this foundation, we further proposed a dataset construction method that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with human efforts to create high-quality data. Specifically, we first generate TVLs using a comprehensive and systematic process, and then label each TVL with corresponding natural language questions using LLMs. This process results in the creation of the first large-scale Text-to-TrajVis dataset, named TrajVL, which contains 18,140 (question, TVL) pairs. Based on this dataset, we systematically evaluated the performance of multiple LLMs (GPT, Qwen, Llama, etc.) on this task. The experimental results demonstrate that this task is both feasible and highly challenging and merits further exploration within the research community.</p></details> |  |

Previous autonomous driving world models either directly feed the trajectory or discrete control signals into the generation pipeline, leading to poor alignment between the control inputs and the implicit features of the 2D base generative model, which results in low-fidelity video outputs. Some methods use coarse textual commands or discrete vehicle control signals, which lack the precision to guide fine-grained, trajectory-specific video generation, making them unsuitable for evaluating actual autonomous driving algorithms. DriVerse introduces explicit trajectory guidance in two complementary forms: it tokenizes trajectories into textual prompts using a predefined trend vocabulary for seamless language integration, and converts 3D trajectories into 2D spatial motion priors to enhance control over static content within the driving scene. To better handle dynamic objects, we further introduce a lightweight motion alignment module, which focuses on the inter-frame consistency of dynamic pixels, significantly enhancing the temporal coherence of moving elements over long sequences. With minimal training and no need for additional data, DriVerse outperforms specialized models on future video generation tasks across both the nuScenes and Waymo datasets. The code and models will be released to the public.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Modern trajectory prediction models strive to interpret complex patterns and dependencies from agent and map data. The Motion Transformer (MTR) architecture and subsequent work define the most accurate methods in common benchmarks such as the Waymo Open Motion Benchmark. The MTR model employs pre-generated static intention points as initial goal points for trajectory prediction. However, the static nature of these points frequently leads to misalignment with map data in specific traffic scenarios, resulting in unfeasible or unrealistic goal points. Our research addresses this limitation by integrating scene-specific dynamic intention points into the MTR model. This adaptation of the MTR model was trained and evaluated on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating dynamic intention points has a significant positive impact on trajectory prediction accuracy, especially for predictions over long time horizons. Furthermore, we analyze the impact on ground truth trajectories which are not compliant with the map data or are illegal maneuvers.</p></details> |  |

Agents and their social interactions have been quantified and modeled by researchers from various perspectives; however, substantial limitations exist in the current work due to the inherent high uncertainty of agent intentions and the complex higher-order influences among neighboring groups. SocialMOIF is proposed to tackle these challenges, concentrating on the higher-order intention interactions among neighboring groups while reinforcing the primary role of first-order intention interactions between neighbors and the target agent. This method develops a multi-order intention fusion model to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of both direct and indirect intention information. Within SocialMOIF, a trajectory distribution approximator is designed to guide the trajectories toward values that align more closely with the actual data, thereby enhancing model interpretability. Furthermore, a global trajectory optimizer is introduced to enable more accurate and efficient parallel predictions. By incorporating a novel loss function that accounts for distance and direction during training, experimental results demonstrate that the model outperforms previous state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics in both dynamic and static datasets.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |

Most existing methods in offline safe RL rely on cost constraints at each time step (derived from global cost constraints) and this can result in either overly conservative policies or violation of safety constraints. In this paper, we propose to learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories. To be specific, we first partition the pre-collected dataset of state-action trajectories into desirable and undesirable subsets. Intuitively, the desirable set contains high reward and safe trajectories, and undesirable set contains unsafe trajectories and low-reward safe trajectories. Second, we learn a policy that generates desirable trajectories and avoids undesirable trajectories, where (un)desirability scores are provided by a classifier learnt from the dataset of desirable and undesirable trajectories. This approach bypasses the computational complexity and stability issues of a min-max objective that is employed in existing methods. Theoretically, we also show our approach's strong connections to existing learning paradigms involving human feedback. Finally, we extensively evaluate our method using the DSRL benchmark for offline safe RL. Empirically, our method outperforms competitive baselines, achieving higher rewards and better constraint satisfaction across a wide variety of benchmark tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2025.

Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</p></details> |  |

So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</p></details> |  |

However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Current model-based SOH estimation methods typically rely on low C-rate constant current tests to extract health parameters like solid phase volume fraction and lithium-ion stoichiometry, which are often impractical in real-world scenarios due to time and operational constraints. Additionally, these methods are susceptible to modeling uncertainties that can significantly degrade the estimation accuracy, especially when jointly estimating multiple parameters. In this paper, we present a novel reference voltage-based method for robust battery SOH estimation. This method utilizes the voltage response of a battery under a predefined current excitation at the beginning of life (BOL) as a reference to compensate for modeling uncertainty. As the battery degrades, the same excitation is applied to generate the voltage response, which is compared with the BOL trajectory to estimate the key health parameters accurately. The current excitation is optimally designed using the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm to maximize the information content of the target parameters. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves parameter estimation accuracy under different degradation levels, compared to conventional methods relying only on direct voltage measurements. Furthermore, our method jointly estimates four key SOH parameters in only 10 minutes, making it practical for real-world battery health diagnostics, e.g., fast testing to enable battery repurposing.</p></details> |  |

However, their out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge, particularly due to unbalanced data and a lack of enough data and diversity to ensure robustness and calibration. To address this, we propose SHIFT (Spectral Heteroscedastic Informed Forecasting for Trajectories), a novel framework that uniquely combines well-calibrated uncertainty modeling with informative priors derived through automated rule extraction. SHIFT reformulates trajectory prediction as a classification task and employs heteroscedastic spectral-normalized Gaussian processes to effectively disentangle epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. We learn informative priors from training labels, which are automatically generated from natural language driving rules, such as stop rules and drivability constraints, using a retrieval-augmented generation framework powered by a large language model. Extensive evaluations over the nuScenes dataset, including challenging low-data and cross-location scenarios, demonstrate that SHIFT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving substantial gains in uncertainty calibration and displacement metrics. In particular, our model excels in complex scenarios, such as intersections, where uncertainty is inherently higher.

While concept erasure methods offer a promising solution, existing finetuning-based approaches suffer from notable limitations. Anchor-free methods risk disrupting sampling trajectories, leading to visual artifacts, while anchor-based methods rely on the heuristic selection of anchor concepts. To overcome these shortcomings, we introduce a finetuning framework, dubbed ANT, which Automatically guides deNoising Trajectories to avoid unwanted concepts. ANT is built on a key insight: reversing the condition direction of classifier-free guidance during mid-to-late denoising stages enables precise content modification without sacrificing early-stage structural integrity. This inspires a trajectory-aware objective that preserves the integrity of the early-stage score function field, which steers samples toward the natural image manifold, without relying on heuristic anchor concept selection. For single-concept erasure, we propose an augmentation-enhanced weight saliency map to precisely identify the critical parameters that most significantly contribute to the unwanted concept, enabling more thorough and efficient erasure. For multi-concept erasure, our objective function offers a versatile plug-and-play solution that significantly boosts performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ANT achieves state-of-the-art results in both single and multi-concept erasure, delivering high-quality, safe outputs without compromising the generative fidelity.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

In this study, we apply Inverse Dynamics Models (IDM) with different encoders and policy heads to trajectory following in a modern 3D video game -- Bleeding Edge. Additionally, we investigate several future alignment strategies that address the distribution shift caused by the aleatoric uncertainty and imperfections of the agent. We measure both the trajectory deviation distance and the first significant deviation point between the reference and the agent's trajectory and show that the optimal configuration depends on the chosen setting. Our results show that in a diverse data setting, a GPT-style policy head with an encoder trained from scratch performs the best, DINOv2 encoder with the GPT-style policy head gives the best results in the low data regime, and both GPT-style and MLP-style policy heads had comparable results when pre-trained on a diverse setting and fine-tuned for a specific behaviour setting.</p></details> |  |

This overlooks the critical fact that the tires and the surface are the two force-transmitting partners in vehicle dynamics; while the tires stay with the vehicle, surface conditions vary with location. Recognizing these challenges, this paper presents a novel framework for spatially resolving dynamic constraints in both offline and online planning algorithms applied to autonomous racing. We introduce the GripMap concept, which provides a spatial resolution of vehicle dynamic constraints in the Frenet frame, allowing adaptation to locally varying grip conditions. This enables compensation for location-specific effects, more efficient vehicle behavior, and increased safety, unattainable with spatially invariant vehicle models. The focus is on low storage demand and quick access through perfect hashing. This framework proved advantageous in real-world applications in the presented form. Experiments inspired by autonomous racing demonstrate its effectiveness. In future work, this framework can serve as a foundational layer for developing future interpretable learning algorithms that adjust to varying grip conditions in real-time.</p></details> |  |

Both tasks comprise transductive settings, where the model predicts links among known nodes, and in inductive settings, where it generalises learned patterns to previously unseen nodes. Existing TGN designs face a dilemma under these dual scenarios. Anonymous TGNs, which rely solely on temporal and structural information, offer strong inductive generalisation but struggle to distinguish known nodes. In contrast, non-anonymous TGNs leverage node features to excel in transductive tasks yet fail to adapt to new nodes. To address this challenge, we propose Trajectory Encoding TGN (TETGN). Our approach introduces automatically expandable node identifiers (IDs) as learnable temporal positional features and performs message passing over these IDs to capture each node's historical context. By integrating this trajectory-aware module with a standard TGN using multi-head attention, TETGN effectively balances transductive accuracy with inductive generalisation. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that TETGN significantly outperforms strong baselines on both link prediction and node classification tasks, demonstrating its ability to unify the advantages of anonymous and non-anonymous models for dynamic graph learning.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a lane graph-based motion prediction model that first predicts graph-based goal proposals and later fuses them with cross attention over multiple contextual elements. We follow the famous encoder-interactor-decoder architecture where the encoder encodes scene context using lightweight Gated Recurrent Units, the interactor applies cross-context attention over encoded scene features and graph goal proposals, and the decoder regresses multimodal trajectories via Laplacian Mixture Density Network from the aggregated encodings. Using cross-attention over graph-based goal proposals gives robust trajectory estimates since the model learns to attend to future goal-relevant scene elements for the intended agent. We evaluate our work on nuScenes motion prediction dataset, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Trajectory Embedding for Similarity Computation: When Triangle Inequality Violations in Distance Metrics Matter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10933v1)** | 2025-04-15 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.10933v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is a cornerstone of trajectory data management and analysis. Traditional similarity functions often suffer from high computational complexity and a reliance on specific distance metrics, prompting a shift towards deep representation learning in Euclidean space. However, existing Euclidean-based trajectory embeddings often face challenges due to the triangle inequality constraints that do not universally hold for trajectory data. To address this issue, this paper introduces a novel approach by incorporating non-Euclidean geometry, specifically hyperbolic space, into trajectory representation learning. We present the first-ever integration of hyperbolic space to resolve the inherent limitations of the triangle inequality in Euclidean embeddings. In particular, we achieve it by designing a Lorentz distance measure, which is proven to overcome triangle inequality constraints. Additionally, we design a model-agnostic framework LH-plugin to seamlessly integrate hyperbolic embeddings into existing representation learning pipelines. This includes a novel projection method optimized with the Cosh function to prevent the diminishment of distances, supported by a theoretical foundation. Furthermore, we propose a dynamic fusion distance that intelligently adapts to variations in triangle inequality constraints across different trajectory pairs, blending Lorentzian and Euclidean distances for more robust similarity calculations. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the accuracy of trajectory similarity measures in state-of-the-art models across multiple real-world datasets. The LH-plugin not only addresses the triangle inequality issues but also significantly refines the precision of trajectory similarity computations, marking a substantial advancement in the field of trajectory representation learning.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |

Although predicting the ego-vehicle's path is valuable for driver-assistance systems, existing methods mainly focus on external factors like other vehicles' motions, often neglecting the driver's attention and intent. To address this gap, we infer the ego-trajectory by integrating the driver's gaze and the surrounding scene. We introduce RouteFormer, a novel multimodal ego-trajectory prediction network combining GPS data, environmental context, and the driver's field-of-view, comprising first-person video and gaze fixations. We also present the Path Complexity Index (PCI), a new metric for trajectory complexity that enables a more nuanced evaluation of challenging scenarios. To tackle data scarcity and enhance diversity, we introduce GEM, a comprehensive dataset of urban driving scenarios enriched with synchronized driver field-of-view and gaze data. Extensive evaluations on GEM and DR(eye)VE demonstrate that RouteFormer significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in prediction accuracy across diverse conditions. Ablation studies reveal that incorporating driver field-of-view data yields significantly better average displacement error, especially in challenging scenarios with high PCI scores, underscoring the importance of modeling driver attention.

This paper presents RINGO: Real-time Navigation with a Guiding Trajectory, a novel planning framework that enables aerial manipulators to navigate unknown environments in real time. The proposed method simultaneously considers the positions of both the multi-rotor and the end-effector. A pre-obtained multi-rotor trajectory serves as a guiding reference, allowing the end-effector to generate a smooth, collision-free, and workspace-compatible trajectory. Leveraging the convex hull property of B-spline curves, we theoretically guarantee that the trajectory remains within the reachable workspace. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that enables real-time navigation of aerial manipulators in unknown environments. The simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method generates less conservative trajectories than approaches that consider only the multi-rotor.</p></details> | 9 pages, 15 figures |

In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Traditional assessment tools often fail to fully cover course content, leading to imprecise evaluations of student mastery. To tackle this problem, the study proposes a knowledge graph construction method based on large language models (LLMs), which transforms learning materials into structured data and generates personalized learning trajectory graphs by analyzing students' test data. Experimental results demonstrate that the model effectively alerts teachers to potential biases in their exam questions and tracks individual student progress. This system not only enhances the accuracy of learning assessments but also helps teachers provide timely guidance to students who are falling behind, thereby improving overall teaching strategies.</p></details> |  |

This approach, an upgrade from traditional methods, extends the original algorithm to effectively address 3D perforated surface milling. Unlike conventional algorithms, the method embeds a continuous spiral trajectory within perforated surfaces without requiring cellular decomposition or additional boundaries. The proposed method addresses three primary challenges, including modifying conformal slit mapping for mesh surfaces, maintaining uniform scallop height between adjacent spiral trajectories, and optimizing the mapped origin point to ensure uniform scallop height distribution. To overcome these challenges, surface flattening techniques are incorporated into the original approach to accommodate mesh surfaces effectively. Tool path spacing is then optimized using a binary search strategy to regulate scallop height. A functional energy metric associated with scallop height uniformity is introduced for rapid evaluation of points mapped to the origin, with the minimum functional energy determined through perturbation techniques. The optimal placement of this point is identified using a modified gradient descent approach applied to the energy function. Validation on intricate surfaces, including low-quality and high-genus meshes, verifies the robustness of the algorithm. Surface milling experiments comparing this method with conventional techniques indicate a 15.63% improvement in scallop height uniformity while reducing machining time, average spindle impact, and spindle impact variance by up to 7.36%, 27.79%, and 55.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revised manuscript has improved the quality of the figures</p></details> |

This paper proposes a unified framework that jointly predicts both behavioral intentions and trajectories to enhance prediction accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency. Specifically, we employ a shared context encoder for both intention and trajectory predictions, thereby reducing structural redundancy and information loss. Moreover, we address the lack of ground-truth behavioral intention labels in mainstream datasets (Waymo, Argoverse) by auto-labeling these datasets, thus advancing the community's efforts in this direction. We further introduce a vectorized occupancy prediction module that infers the probability of each map polyline being occupied by the target vehicle's future trajectory. By leveraging these intention and occupancy prediction priors, our method conducts dynamic, modality-dependent pruning of irrelevant agents and map polylines in the decoding stage, effectively reducing computational overhead and mitigating noise from non-critical elements. Our approach ranks first among LiDAR-free methods on the Waymo Motion Dataset and achieves first place on the Waymo Interactive Prediction Dataset. Remarkably, even without model ensembling, our single-model framework improves the soft mean average precision (softmAP) by 10 percent compared to the second-best method in the Waymo Interactive Prediction Leaderboard. Furthermore, the proposed framework has been successfully deployed on real vehicles, demonstrating its practical effectiveness in real-world applications.</p></details> | under review |

In this paper, we propose a novel method for trajectory synthesis by adapting the Time-Based Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (TimeVQVAE). Our approach leverages time-frequency domain processing, vector quantization, and transformer-based priors to capture both global and local dynamics in flight data. By discretizing the latent space and integrating transformer priors, the model learns long-range spatiotemporal dependencies and preserves coherence across entire flight paths. We evaluate the adapted TimeVQVAE using an extensive suite of quality, statistical, and distributional metrics, as well as a flyability assessment conducted in an open-source air traffic simulator. Results indicate that TimeVQVAE outperforms a temporal convolutional VAE baseline, generating synthetic trajectories that mirror real flight data in terms of spatial accuracy, temporal consistency, and statistical properties. Furthermore, the simulator-based assessment shows that most generated trajectories maintain operational feasibility, although occasional outliers underscore the potential need for additional domain-specific constraints. Overall, our findings underscore the importance of multi-scale representation learning for capturing complex flight behaviors and demonstrate the promise of TimeVQVAE in producing representative synthetic trajectories for downstream tasks such as model training, airspace design, and air traffic forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented at the 25th Integrated Communications, Navigation and Surveillance Conference (ICNS 2025), April 8--10, 2025, Brussels, Belgium</p></details> |

Evaluating web agents trajectories is an important problem, since it helps us determine whether the agent successfully completed the tasks. Rule-based methods are widely used for this purpose, but they are challenging to extend to new tasks and may not always recognize successful trajectories. We may achieve higher accuracy through human evaluation, but the process would be substantially slower and more expensive. Automatic evaluations with LLMs may avoid the challenges of designing new rules and manually annotating trajectories, enabling faster and cost-effective evaluation. However, it is unclear how effective they are at evaluating web agents. To this end, we propose AgentRewardBench, the first benchmark to assess the effectiveness of LLM judges for evaluating web agents. AgentRewardBench contains 1302 trajectories across 5 benchmarks and 4 LLMs. Each trajectory in AgentRewardBench is reviewed by an expert, who answers questions pertaining to the success, side effects, and repetitiveness of the agent. Using our benchmark, we evaluate 12 LLM judges and find that no single LLM excels across all benchmarks. We also find that the rule-based evaluation used by common benchmarks tends to underreport the success rate of web agents, highlighting a key weakness of rule-based evaluation and the need to develop more flexible automatic evaluations. We release the benchmark at: https://agent-reward-bench.github.io</p></details> |  |

In This paper, an adaptive transpose Jacobian approach is proposed to deal with the dynamic model complexity, which utilizes an adaptive PI-algorithm to adjust the control gains. The performance of the proposed control algorithm is compared with the conventional transpose Jacobian and sliding mode control algorithms and evaluated by the root mean square of the errors and control input energy criteria. In order to appraise the effectiveness of the proposed control system, simulations are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink software for a quadruped robot leg for semi-elliptical path tracking. The obtained results show that the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian reduces the overshoot and root mean square of the errors and at the same time, decreases the control input energy. Moreover, transpose Jacobin and adaptive transpose Jacobian are more robust to changes in initial conditions compared to the conventional sliding mode control. Furthermore, sliding mode control performs well up to 20% uncertainties in the parameters due to its model-based nature, whereas the transpose Jacobin and the proposed adaptive transpose Jacobian algorithms show promising results even in higher mass uncertainties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Xplore</p></details> |

Thereby, kinematic constraints with respect to velocity, acceleration and jerk are taken into account. The trajectories are composed of several motion primitives, the most crucial of which is termed jerk segment. Within this contribution, the focus is put on the composition of the overall trajectories, assuming the required motion primitives to be readily available. Since the scheme considered is not time-optimal, even decreasing particular constraints can reduce the overall transition time, which is analysed in detail. This observation implies that replanning of the underlying jerk segments is required as an integral part of the motion planning scheme, further insight into which has been analysed in a complementary contribution. Although the proposed scheme is not time-optimal, it allows for significantly shorter transition times than established methods, such as zero-vibration shaping, while requiring significantly lower computational power than a fully time-optimal scheme.</p></details> |  |

The proposed filter, the trajectory measurement PMBM (TM-PMBM) filter, propagates a PMBM density on the set of target states. In prediction, the filter obtains the PMBM density on the set of trajectories over the last two time steps. This density is then updated with the set of trajectory measurements. After the update step, the PMBM posterior on the set of two-step trajectories is marginalised to obtain a PMBM density on the set of target states. The filter provides a closed-form solution for multi-target filtering based on sets of trajectory measurements, estimating the set of target states at the end of each time window. Additionally, the paper proposes computationally lighter alternatives to the TM-PMBM filter by deriving a Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) density through Kullback-Leibler divergence minimisation in an augmented space with auxiliary variables. The performance of the proposed filters are evaluated in a simulation study.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, journal paper</p></details> |

Moreover, incorporating prior information input into such perception model represents an effective approach to ensure the robustness and accuracy. However, utilizing diverse sources of prior information still faces three key challenges: the acquisition of high-quality prior information, alignment between prior and online perception, efficient integration. To address these issues, we investigate prior augmentation from a novel perspective of trajectory priors. In this paper, we initially extract crowdsourcing trajectory data from Argoverse2 motion forecasting dataset and encode trajectory data into rasterized heatmap and vectorized instance tokens, then we incorporate such prior information into the online mapping model through different ways. Besides, with the purpose of mitigating the misalignment between prior and online perception, we design a confidence-based fusion module that takes alignment into account during the fusion process. We conduct extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 dataset. The results indicate that our method's performance significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods.

However, estimating trajectories of brain biomarkers is challenging due to biological variability, inconsistencies in measurement protocols (e.g., differences in MRI scanners), scarcity, and irregularity in longitudinal measurements. Herein, we introduce a novel personalized deep kernel regression framework for forecasting brain biomarkers, with application to regional volumetric measurements. Our approach integrates two key components: a population model that captures brain trajectories from a large and diverse cohort, and a subject-specific model that captures individual trajectories. To optimally combine these, we propose Adaptive Shrinkage Estimation, which effectively balances population and subject-specific models. We assess our model's performance through predictive accuracy metrics, uncertainty quantification, and validation against external clinical studies. Benchmarking against state-of-the-art statistical and machine learning models -- including linear mixed effects models, generalized additive models, and deep learning methods -- demonstrates the superior predictive performance of our approach. Additionally, we apply our method to predict trajectories of composite neuroimaging biomarkers, which highlights the versatility of our approach in modeling the progression of longitudinal neuroimaging biomarkers. Furthermore, validation on three external neuroimaging studies confirms the robustness of our method across different clinical contexts.

In cinematography, Directors of Photography meticulously craft camera movements to achieve expressive and intentional framing. However, existing methods for camera trajectory generation remain limited: Traditional approaches rely on geometric optimization or handcrafted procedural systems, while recent learning-based methods often inherit structural biases or lack textual alignment, constraining creative synthesis. In this work, we introduce an auto-regressive model inspired by the expertise of Directors of Photography to generate artistic and expressive camera trajectories. We first introduce DataDoP, a large-scale multi-modal dataset containing 29K real-world shots with free-moving camera trajectories, depth maps, and detailed captions in specific movements, interaction with the scene, and directorial intent. Thanks to the comprehensive and diverse database, we further train an auto-regressive, decoder-only Transformer for high-quality, context-aware camera movement generation based on text guidance and RGBD inputs, named GenDoP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that compared to existing methods, GenDoP offers better controllability, finer-grained trajectory adjustments, and higher motion stability. We believe our approach establishes a new standard for learning-based cinematography, paving the way for future advancements in camera control and filmmaking.

Traditional approaches often rely on static snapshots of network states, which can obscure the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. In this study, we introduce a dynamic framework that quantifies the unpredictability of opinion trajectories using the normalized Lempel-Ziv (nLZ) complexity. Our approach leverages an adaptive social network model where each node is characterized by three behavioral parameters - homophily, neophily, and social conformity - and where opinions evolve continuously according to a system of ordinary differential equations. The results reveal distinct nLZ complexity signatures for each node type: homophilic nodes exhibit consistently rising complexity, reflecting increasingly unpredictable opinion shifts that are counterintuitive given their tendency for similarity; neophilic nodes maintain low and stable complexity, suggesting that openness to novelty can, surprisingly, lead to stable opinion dynamics; and conformic nodes display a U-shaped complexity trend, transitioning from early opinion stagnation to later unpredictability. In fully heterogeneous networks, modest interaction effects emerge, with slight shifts in the unpredictability of each faction's trajectories. These findings underscore the importance of temporal analysis in uncovering hidden dynamical patterns, offering novel insights into the mechanisms underlying social adaptation and polarization.</p></details> |  |

Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |

The existing trajectory planners that account for the robot's physical geometry severely suffer from the intractable runtime. To achieve both computational efficiency and Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA) of arbitrary-shaped ground robot planning, we proposed a novel coarse-to-fine navigation framework that significantly accelerates planning. In the first stage, a sampling-based method selectively generates distinct topological paths that guarantee a minimum inflated margin. In the second stage, a geometry-aware front-end strategy is designed to discretize these topologies into full-state robot motion sequences while concurrently partitioning the paths into SE(2) sub-problems and simpler R2 sub-problems for back-end optimization. In the final stage, an SVSDF-based optimizer generates trajectories tailored to these sub-problems and seamlessly splices them into a continuous final motion plan. Extensive benchmark comparisons show that the proposed method is one to several orders of magnitude faster than the cutting-edge methods in runtime while maintaining a high planning success rate and ensuring CCA.</p></details> |  |

Existing hand trajectory prediction (HTP) methods forecast the future hand waypoints in 3D space conditioned on past egocentric observations. However, such models are only designed to accommodate 2D egocentric video inputs. There is a lack of awareness of multimodal environmental information from both 2D and 3D observations, hindering the further improvement of 3D HTP performance. In addition, these models overlook the synergy between hand movements and headset camera egomotion, either predicting hand trajectories in isolation or encoding egomotion only from past frames. To address these limitations, we propose novel diffusion models (MMTwin) for multimodal 3D hand trajectory prediction. MMTwin is designed to absorb multimodal information as input encompassing 2D RGB images, 3D point clouds, past hand waypoints, and text prompt. Besides, two latent diffusion models, the egomotion diffusion and the HTP diffusion as twins, are integrated into MMTwin to predict camera egomotion and future hand trajectories concurrently. We propose a novel hybrid Mamba-Transformer module as the denoising model of the HTP diffusion to better fuse multimodal features. The experimental results on three publicly available datasets and our self-recorded data demonstrate that our proposed MMTwin can predict plausible future 3D hand trajectories compared to the state-of-the-art baselines, and generalizes well to unseen environments.

It performs optimal controls by directly harnessing input-output (I/O) data, bypassing the process of explicit model identification that can be costly and time-consuming. However, its high computational complexity, driven by a large-scale optimization problem (typically in a higher dimension than its model-based counterpart--Model Predictive Control), hinders real-time applications. To overcome this limitation, we propose the data-enabled neighboring extremal (DeeNE) framework, which significantly reduces computational cost while preserving control performance. DeeNE leverages first-order optimality perturbation analysis to efficiently update a precomputed nominal DeePC solution in response to changes in initial conditions and reference trajectories. We validate its effectiveness on a 7-DoF KINOVA Gen3 robotic arm, demonstrating substantial computational savings and robust, data-driven control performance.</p></details> |  |

Current methods in this space require specific architectural changes to image generation models, which limit their adaptability and scalability. In contrast to such methods, we provide a model-agnostic approach. We use intersections in diffusion trajectories, working only with the latent values. We could not obtain localized frame-wise coherence and diversity using only the intersection of trajectories. Thus, we instead use a grid-based approach. An in-context trained LLM is used to generate coherent frame-wise prompts; another is used to identify differences between frames. Based on these, we obtain a CLIP-based attention mask that controls the timing of switching the prompts for each grid cell. Earlier switching results in higher variance, while later switching results in more coherence. Therefore, our approach can ensure appropriate control between coherence and variance for the frames. Our approach results in state-of-the-art performance while being more flexible when working with diverse image-generation models.

| **[End-to-End Driving with Online Trajectory Evaluation via BEV World Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01941v2)** | 2025-04-09 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.01941v2) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable progress by integrating perception, prediction, and planning into a fully differentiable framework. Yet, to fully realize its potential, an effective online trajectory evaluation is indispensable to ensure safety. By forecasting the future outcomes of a given trajectory, trajectory evaluation becomes much more effective. This goal can be achieved by employing a world model to capture environmental dynamics and predict future states. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end driving framework WoTE, which leverages a BEV World model to predict future BEV states for Trajectory Evaluation. The proposed BEV world model is latency-efficient compared to image-level world models and can be seamlessly supervised using off-the-shelf BEV-space traffic simulators. We validate our framework on both the NAVSIM benchmark and the closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark based on the CARLA simulator, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Code is released at https://github.com/liyingyanUCAS/WoTE.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAFE-AD: Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06584v1)** | 2025-04-09 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.06584v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning based planning tasks on the nuPlan dataset have gained great interest due to their potential to generate human-like driving behaviors. However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate its effectiveness in real-world environments. The code and models will be made available at https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRA ...</summary><p>ICRA 2025; first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven Fuzzy Control for Time-Optimal Aggressive Trajectory Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06500v1)** | 2025-04-09 | [papers-cool](https://papers.cool/arxiv/2504.06500v1) | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal trajectories that minimize a user-defined cost function in dynamic systems require the solution of a two-point boundary value problem. The optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures, submitted to MECC 2025</p></details> |
