| **[TopViewRS: Vision-Language Models as Top-View Spatial Reasoners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02537v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Top-view perspective denotes a typical way in which humans read and reason over different types of maps, and it is vital for localization and navigation of humans as well as of `non-human' agents, such as the ones backed by large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Nonetheless, spatial reasoning capabilities of modern VLMs remain unattested and underexplored. In this work, we thus study their capability to understand and reason over spatial relations from the top view. The focus on top view also enables controlled evaluations at different granularity of spatial reasoning; we clearly disentangle different abilities (e.g., recognizing particular objects versus understanding their relative positions). We introduce the TopViewRS (Top-View Reasoning in Space) dataset, consisting of 11,384 multiple-choice questions with either realistic or semantic top-view map as visual input. We then use it to study and evaluate VLMs across 4 perception and reasoning tasks with different levels of complexity. Evaluation of 10 representative open- and closed-source VLMs reveals the gap of more than 50% compared to average human performance, and it is even lower than the random baseline in some cases. Although additional experiments show that Chain-of-Thought reasoning can boost model capabilities by 5.82% on average, the overall performance of VLMs remains limited. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced model capability in top-view spatial reasoning and set a foundation for further research towards human-level proficiency of VLMs in real-world multimodal tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables (21 pages, 4 figures, 15 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[IterMask2: Iterative Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation via Spatial and Frequency Masking for Brain Lesions in MRI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02422v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised anomaly segmentation approaches to pathology segmentation train a model on images of healthy subjects, that they define as the 'normal' data distribution. At inference, they aim to segment any pathologies in new images as 'anomalies', as they exhibit patterns that deviate from those in 'normal' training data. Prevailing methods follow the 'corrupt-and-reconstruct' paradigm. They intentionally corrupt an input image, reconstruct it to follow the learned 'normal' distribution, and subsequently segment anomalies based on reconstruction error. Corrupting an input image, however, inevitably leads to suboptimal reconstruction even of normal regions, causing false positives. To alleviate this, we propose a novel iterative spatial mask-refining strategy IterMask2. We iteratively mask areas of the image, reconstruct them, and update the mask based on reconstruction error. This iterative process progressively adds information about areas that are confidently normal as per the model. The increasing content guides reconstruction of nearby masked areas, improving reconstruction of normal tissue under these areas, reducing false positives. We also use high-frequency image content as an auxiliary input to provide additional structural information for masked areas. This further improves reconstruction error of normal in comparison to anomalous areas, facilitating segmentation of the latter. We conduct experiments on several brain lesion datasets and demonstrate effectiveness of our method. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZiyunLiang/IterMasks2</p></details> |  |
| **[Distortions in Judged Spatial Relations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04218v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a benchmark for assessing the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discern intercardinal directions between geographic locations and apply it to three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2. This benchmark specifically evaluates whether LLMs exhibit a hierarchical spatial bias similar to humans, where judgments about individual locations' spatial relationships are influenced by the perceived relationships of the larger groups that contain them. To investigate this, we formulated 14 questions focusing on well-known American cities. Seven questions were designed to challenge the LLMs with scenarios potentially influenced by the orientation of larger geographical units, such as states or countries, while the remaining seven targeted locations were less susceptible to such hierarchical categorization. Among the tested models, GPT-4 exhibited superior performance with 55 percent accuracy, followed by GPT-3.5 at 47 percent, and Llama-2 at 45 percent. The models showed significantly reduced accuracy on tasks with suspected hierarchical bias. For example, GPT-4's accuracy dropped to 33 percent on these tasks, compared to 86 percent on others. However, the models identified the nearest cardinal direction in most cases, reflecting their associative learning mechanism, thereby embodying human-like misconceptions. We discuss avenues for improving the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for publication in The Professional Geographer</p></details> |
| **[AROMA: Preserving Spatial Structure for Latent PDE Modeling with Local Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02176v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AROMA (Attentive Reduced Order Model with Attention), a framework designed to enhance the modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) using local neural fields. Our flexible encoder-decoder architecture can obtain smooth latent representations of spatial physical fields from a variety of data types, including irregular-grid inputs and point clouds. This versatility eliminates the need for patching and allows efficient processing of diverse geometries. The sequential nature of our latent representation can be interpreted spatially and permits the use of a conditional transformer for modeling the temporal dynamics of PDEs. By employing a diffusion-based formulation, we achieve greater stability and enable longer rollouts compared to conventional MSE training. AROMA's superior performance in simulating 1D and 2D equations underscores the efficacy of our approach in capturing complex dynamical behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Variable importance measure for spatial machine learning models with application to air pollution exposure prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01982v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exposure assessment is fundamental to air pollution cohort studies. The objective is to predict air pollution exposures for study subjects at locations without data in order to optimize our ability to learn about health effects of air pollution. In addition to generating accurate predictions to minimize exposure measurement error, understanding the mechanism captured by the model is another crucial aspect that may not always be straightforward due to the complex nature of machine learning methods, as well as the lack of unifying notions of variable importance. This is further complicated in air pollution modeling by the presence of spatial correlation. We tackle these challenges in two datasets: sulfur (S) from regulatory United States national PM2.5 sub-species data and ultrafine particles (UFP) from a new Seattle-area traffic-related air pollution dataset. Our key contribution is a leave-one-out approach for variable importance that leads to interpretable and comparable measures for a broad class of models with separable mean and covariance components. We illustrate our approach with several spatial machine learning models, and it clearly highlights the difference in model mechanisms, even for those producing similar predictions. We leverage insights from this variable importance measure to assess the relative utilities of two exposure models for S and UFP that have similar out-of-sample prediction accuracies but appear to draw on different types of spatial information to make predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialRGPT: Grounded Spatial Reasoning in Vision Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01584v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in 2D vision and language tasks. However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, effectively reasoning about complex spatial relations and functioning as a region-aware dense reward annotator for robotic tasks. Code, dataset, and benchmark will be released at https://www.anjiecheng.me/SpatialRGPT</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.anjiecheng.me/SpatialRGPT</p></details> |

Using this result, we deduce the discrete stochastic maximal \( L^p \)-regularity estimate for a spatial semidiscretization. Furthermore, we derive (nearly) sharp error estimates for the semidiscretization under the general spatial \( L^q \)-norms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Computation Using Spatial-Photonic Ising Machines: Utilizing Low-Rank and Circulant Matrix Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01400v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the potential of spatial-photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) to address computationally intensive Ising problems that employ low-rank and circulant coupling matrices. Our results indicate that the performance of SPIMs is critically affected by the rank and precision of the coupling matrices. By developing and assessing advanced decomposition techniques, we expand the range of problems SPIMs can solve, overcoming the limitations of traditional Mattis-type matrices. Our approach accommodates a diverse array of coupling matrices, including those with inherently low ranks, applicable to complex NP-complete problems. We explore the practical benefits of low-rank approximation in optimization tasks, particularly in financial optimization, to demonstrate the real-world applications of SPIMs. Finally, we evaluate the computational limitations imposed by SPIM hardware precision and suggest strategies to optimize the performance of these systems within these constraints.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Approaches to biological species delimitation based on genetic and spatial dissimilarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12126v4)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The delimitation of biological species, i.e., deciding which individuals belong to the same species and whether and how many different species are represented in a data set, is key to the conservation of biodiversity. Much existing work uses only genetic data for species delimitation, often employing some kind of cluster analysis. This can be misleading, because geographically distant groups of individuals can be genetically quite different even if they belong to the same species. We investigate the problem of testing whether two potentially separated groups of individuals can belong to a single species or not based on genetic and spatial data. Existing methods such as the partial Mantel test and jackknife-based distance-distance regression are considered. New approaches, i.e., an adaptation of a mixed effects model, a bootstrap approach, and a jackknife version of partial Mantel, are proposed. All these methods address the issue that distance data violate the independence assumption for standard inference regarding correlation and regression; a standard linear regression is also considered. The approaches are compared on simulated meta-populations generated with SLiM and GSpace - two software packages that can simulate spatially-explicit genetic data at an individual level. Simulations show that the new jackknife version of the partial Mantel test provides a good compromise between power and respecting the nominal type I error rate. Mixed-effects models have larger power than jackknife-based methods, but tend to display type I error rates slightly above the significance level. An application on brassy ringlets concludes the paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper of 26 pages with 6 figures; appendix of 19 pages with 17 figures.

| **[PruNeRF: Segment-Centric Dataset Pruning via 3D Spatial Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00798v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have shown remarkable performance in learning 3D scenes. However, NeRF exhibits vulnerability when confronted with distractors in the training images -- unexpected objects are present only within specific views, such as moving entities like pedestrians or birds. Excluding distractors during dataset construction is a straightforward solution, but without prior knowledge of their types and quantities, it becomes prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we propose PruNeRF, a segment-centric dataset pruning framework via 3D spatial consistency, that effectively identifies and prunes the distractors. We first examine existing metrics for measuring pixel-wise distraction and introduce Influence Functions for more accurate measurements. Then, we assess 3D spatial consistency using a depth-based reprojection technique to obtain 3D-aware distraction. Furthermore, we incorporate segmentation for pixel-to-segment refinement, enabling more precise identification. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PruNeRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in robustness against distractors.</p></details> |  |
| **[A memory-based spatial evolutionary game with the dynamic interaction between learners and profiteers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00662v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial evolutionary games provide a valuable framework for elucidating the emergence and maintenance of cooperative behavior. However, most previous studies assume that individuals are profiteers and neglect to consider the effects of memory. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a memory-based spatial evolutionary game with dynamic interaction between learners and profiteers. Specifically, there are two different categories of individuals in the network, including profiteers and learners with different strategy updating rules. Notably, there is a dynamic interaction between profiteers and learners, i.e., each individual has the transition probability between profiteers and learners, which is portrayed by a Markov process. Besides, the payoff of each individual is not only determined by a single round of the game but also depends on the memory mechanism of the individual. Extensive numerical simulations validate the theoretical analysis and uncover that dynamic interactions between profiteers and learners foster cooperation, memory mechanisms facilitate the emergence of cooperative behaviors among profiteers, and increasing the learning rate of learners promotes a rise in the number of cooperators. In addition, the robustness of the model is verified through simulations across various network sizes. Overall, this work contributes to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms driving the formation and evolution of cooperation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Correctness Comparison of ChatGPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, and Copilot for Spatial Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02404v3)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI including large language models (LLMs) has recently gained significant interest in the geo-science community through its versatile task-solving capabilities including programming, arithmetic reasoning, generation of sample data, time-series forecasting, toponym recognition, or image classification. Most existing performance assessments of LLMs for spatial tasks have primarily focused on ChatGPT, whereas other chatbots received less attention. To narrow this research gap, this study conducts a zero-shot correctness evaluation for a set of 76 spatial tasks across seven task categories assigned to four prominent chatbots, i.e., ChatGPT-4, Gemini, Claude-3, and Copilot. The chatbots generally performed well on tasks related to spatial literacy, GIS theory, and interpretation of programming code and functions, but revealed weaknesses in mapping, code writing, and spatial reasoning. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in correctness of results between the four chatbots. Responses from repeated tasks assigned to each chatbot showed a high level of consistency in responses with matching rates of over 80% for most task categories in the four chatbots.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review in Transactions in GIS</p></details> |
| **[DynaSeg: A Deep Dynamic Fusion Method for Unsupervised Image Segmentation Incorporating Feature Similarity and Spatial Continuity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05477v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our work tackles the fundamental challenge of image segmentation in computer vision, which is crucial for diverse applications. While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. We introduce DynaSeg, an innovative unsupervised image segmentation approach that overcomes the challenge of balancing feature similarity and spatial continuity without relying on extensive hyperparameter tuning. Unlike traditional methods, DynaSeg employs a dynamic weighting scheme that automates parameter tuning, adapts flexibly to image characteristics, and facilitates easy integration with other segmentation networks. By incorporating a Silhouette Score Phase, DynaSeg prevents undersegmentation failures where the number of predicted clusters might converge to one. DynaSeg uses CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, making it computationally efficient and more straightforward than other complex models. Experimental results showcase state-of-the-art performance, achieving a 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement over current unsupervised segmentation approaches on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively. We provide qualitative and quantitative results on five benchmark datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Audio-Visual Talker Localization in Video for Spatial Sound Reproduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00495v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object-based audio production requires the positional metadata to be defined for each point-source object, including the key elements in the foreground of the sound scene. In many media production use cases, both cameras and microphones are employed to make recordings, and the human voice is often a key element. In this research, we detect and locate the active speaker in the video, facilitating the automatic extraction of the positional metadata of the talker relative to the camera's reference frame. With the integration of the visual modality, this study expands upon our previous investigation focused solely on audio-based active speaker detection and localization. Our experiments compare conventional audio-visual approaches for active speaker detection that leverage monaural audio, our previous audio-only method that leverages multichannel recordings from a microphone array, and a novel audio-visual approach integrating vision and multichannel audio. We found the role of the two modalities to complement each other. Multichannel audio, overcoming the problem of visual occlusions, provides a double-digit reduction in detection error compared to audio-visual methods with single-channel audio. The combination of multichannel audio and vision further enhances spatial accuracy, leading to a four-percentage point increase in F1 score on the Tragic Talkers dataset. Future investigations will assess the robustness of the model in noisy and highly reverberant environments, as well as tackle the problem of off-screen speakers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zone Evaluation: Revealing Spatial Bias in Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13215v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental limitation of object detectors is that they suffer from "spatial bias", and in particular perform less satisfactorily when detecting objects near image borders. For a long time, there has been a lack of effective ways to measure and identify spatial bias, and little is known about where it comes from and what degree it is. To this end, we present a new zone evaluation protocol, extending from the traditional evaluation to a more generalized one, which measures the detection performance over zones, yielding a series of Zone Precisions (ZPs). For the first time, we provide numerical results, showing that the object detectors perform quite unevenly across the zones. Surprisingly, the detector's performance in the 96% border zone of the image does not reach the AP value (Average Precision, commonly regarded as the average detection performance in the entire image zone). To better understand spatial bias, a series of heuristic experiments are conducted. Our investigation excludes two intuitive conjectures about spatial bias that the object scale and the absolute positions of objects barely influence the spatial bias. We find that the key lies in the human-imperceptible divergence in data patterns between objects in different zones, thus eventually forming a visible performance gap between the zones. With these findings, we finally discuss a future direction for object detection, namely, spatial disequilibrium problem, aiming at pursuing a balanced detection ability over the entire image zone. By broadly evaluating 10 popular object detectors and 5 detection datasets, we shed light on the spatial bias of object detectors. We hope this work could raise a focus on detection robustness.

| **[QuST: QuPath Extension for Integrative Whole Slide Image and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01613v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, various technologies have been introduced into digital pathology, including artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods, in both areas of pathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis and spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis. AI-driven WSI analysis utilizes the power of deep learning (DL), expands the field of view for histopathological image analysis. On the other hand, ST bridges the gap between tissue spatial analysis and biological signals, offering the possibility to understand the spatial biology. However, a major bottleneck in DL-based WSI analysis is the preparation of training patterns, as hematoxylin \& eosin (H\&E) staining does not provide direct biological evidence, such as gene expression, for determining the category of a biological component. On the other hand, as of now, the resolution in ST is far beyond that of WSI, resulting the challenge of further spatial analysis. Although various WSI analysis tools, including QuPath, have cited the use of WSI analysis tools in the context of ST analysis, its usage is primarily focused on initial image analysis, with other tools being utilized for more detailed transcriptomic analysis. As a result, the information hidden beneath WSI has not yet been fully utilized to support ST analysis. To bridge this gap, we introduce QuST, a QuPath extension designed to bridge the gap between H\&E WSI and ST analyzing tasks. In this paper, we highlight the importance of integrating DL-based WSI analysis and ST analysis in understanding disease biology and the challenges in integrating these modalities due to differences in data formats and analytical methods. The QuST source code is hosted on GitHub and documentation is available at https://github.com/huangch/qust.</p></details> |  |

For non-smooth initial values, the regularity of the mild solution is investigated, and an error estimate is derived with the spatial $ L^2 $-norm. For smooth initial values, two error estimates with the general spatial $ L^q $-norms are established.</p></details> |  |

| **[Unlocking the Power of Spatial and Temporal Information in Medical Multimodal Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19654v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical vision-language pre-training methods mainly leverage the correspondence between paired medical images and radiological reports. Although multi-view spatial images and temporal sequences of image-report pairs are available in off-the-shelf multi-modal medical datasets, most existing methods have not thoroughly tapped into such extensive supervision signals. In this paper, we introduce the Med-ST framework for fine-grained spatial and temporal modeling to exploit information from multiple spatial views of chest radiographs and temporal historical records. For spatial modeling, Med-ST employs the Mixture of View Expert (MoVE) architecture to integrate different visual features from both frontal and lateral views. To achieve a more comprehensive alignment, Med-ST not only establishes the global alignment between whole images and texts but also introduces modality-weighted local alignment between text tokens and spatial regions of images. For temporal modeling, we propose a novel cross-modal bidirectional cycle consistency objective by forward mapping classification (FMC) and reverse mapping regression (RMR). By perceiving temporal information from simple to complex, Med-ST can learn temporal semantics. Experimental results across four distinct tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-ST, especially in temporal classification tasks.

It involves manipulating multiple geometries while maintaining the logical or physical coherence of the objects depicted in the image. Previous language driven image editing methods can change the texture and geometry of objects in the image but fail at producing spatial variations, i.e. modifying spatial relations between objects while maintaining their identities. We present a language driven editing method that can produce spatial variations of icon images. Our method takes in an icon image along with a user's editing request text prompt and outputs an edited icon image reflecting the user's editing request. Our method is designed based on two key observations: (1) A user's editing requests can be translated by a large language model (LLM), with help from a domain specific language (DSL) library, into to a set of geometrical constraints defining the relationships between segments in an icon image. (2) Optimizing the affine transformations of the segments with respect to these geometrical constraints can produce icon images that fulfill the editing request and preserve overall physical and logical coherence. Quantitative and qualitative results show that our system outperforms multiple baselines, enabling natural editing of icon images.</p></details> |  |

Standard covariance functions based on geodesic distances are not guaranteed to be positive definite on such domains, while existing non-Euclidean approaches fail to respect the partially Euclidean nature of these domains where the geodesic distance agrees with the Euclidean distances for some pairs of points. Using a visibility graph on the domain, we propose a class of covariance functions that preserve Euclidean-based covariances between points that are connected in the domain while incorporating the non-convex geometry of the domain via conditional independence relationships. We show that the proposed method preserves the partially Euclidean nature of the intrinsic geometry on the domain while maintaining validity (positive definiteness) and marginal stationarity of the covariance function over the entire parameter space, properties which are not always fulfilled by existing approaches to construct covariance functions on non-convex domains. We provide useful approximations to improve computational efficiency, resulting in a scalable algorithm. We compare the performance of our method with those of competing state-of-the-art methods using simulation studies on synthetic non-convex domains. The method is applied to data regarding acidity levels in the Chesapeake Bay, showing its potential for ecological monitoring in real-world spatial applications on irregular domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>expan...</summary><p>expanded with supporting information</p></details> |

Given a human demonstration, we seek a learning architecture that infers a succinct ${program}$ representation that explains the observed instance. Additionally, the approach should generalize inductively to novel structures of different sizes or complex structures expressed as a hierarchical composition of previously learned concepts. Existing approaches that use code generation capabilities of pre-trained large (visual) language models, as well as purely neural models, show poor generalization to a-priori unseen complex concepts. Our key insight is to factor inductive concept learning as (i) ${\it Sketch:}$ detecting and inferring a coarse signature of a new concept (ii) ${\it Plan:}$ performing MCTS search over grounded action sequences (iii) ${\it Generalize:}$ abstracting out grounded plans as inductive programs. Our pipeline facilitates generalization and modular reuse, enabling continual concept learning. Our approach combines the benefits of the code generation ability of large language models (LLM) along with grounded neural representations, resulting in neuro-symbolic programs that show stronger inductive generalization on the task of constructing complex structures in relation to LLM-only and neural-only approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate reasoning and planning capabilities with learned concepts for embodied instruction following.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Fidelity and Spatial Enhancement: An Assessment and Cascading of Pan-Sharpening Techniques for Satellite Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18900v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research presents a comprehensive assessment of pan-sharpening techniques for satellite imagery, focusing on the critical aspects of spectral fidelity and spatial enhancement.

The research findings underscore the intricate trade-offs between spectral accuracy of about 88\% with spatial resolution enhancement. The research sheds light on the practical implications of pan-sharpening and emphasizes the significance of both spectral and spatial aspects in remote sensing applications. Various pan-sharpening algorithms were systematically employed to provide a holistic view of their performance, contributing to a deeper understanding of their capabilities and limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSGA-Net: Stepwise Spatial Global-local Aggregation Networks for for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18857v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-based perception is the key module for autonomous driving. Among those visual perception tasks, video object detection is a primary yet challenging one because of feature degradation caused by fast motion or multiple poses. Current models usually aggregate features from the neighboring frames to enhance the object representations for the task heads to generate more accurate predictions. Though getting better performance, these methods rely on the information from the future frames and suffer from high computational complexity. Meanwhile, the aggregation process is not reconfigurable during the inference time. These issues make most of the existing models infeasible for online applications. To solve these problems, we introduce a stepwise spatial global-local aggregation network. Our proposed models mainly contain three parts: 1). Multi-stage stepwise network gradually refines the predictions and object representations from the previous stage; 2). Spatial global-local aggregation fuses the local information from the neighboring frames and global semantics from the current frame to eliminate the feature degradation; 3). Dynamic aggregation strategy stops the aggregation process early based on the refinement results to remove redundancy and improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on the ImageNet VID benchmark validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed models.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional methods often struggle to capture the complex dynamics of meteorological systems, particularly in the presence of high-resolution data. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Attention Network (SFANet), a novel deep learning framework designed to address these challenges and enhance the accuracy of spatiotemporal weather prediction. Drawing inspiration from the limitations of existing methodologies, we present an innovative approach that seamlessly integrates advanced token mixing and attention mechanisms. By leveraging both pooling and spatial mixing strategies, SFANet optimizes the processing of high-dimensional spatiotemporal sequences, preserving inter-component relational information and modeling extensive long-range relationships. To further enhance feature integration, we introduce a novel spatial-frequency attention module, enabling the model to capture intricate cross-modal correlations. Our extensive experimental evaluation on two distinct datasets, the Storm EVent ImageRy (SEVIR) and the Institute for Climate and Application Research (ICAR) - El Ni\~{n}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) dataset, demonstrates the remarkable performance of SFANet. Notably, SFANet achieves substantial advancements over state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its proficiency in forecasting precipitation patterns and predicting El Ni\~{n}o events.</p></details> |  |

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality. However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth. Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering quality. Our code will be available.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Fortunately, machine learning provides a new avenue for addressing this challenge. However, several key issues remain unresolved, including the performance in more general edge removal scenarios, capturing robustness through attack curves instead of directly training for robustness, scalability of predictive tasks, and transferability of predictive capabilities. In this paper, we address these challenges by designing a convolutional neural networks (CNN) model with spatial pyramid pooling networks (SPP-net), adapting existing evaluation metrics, redesigning the attack modes, introducing appropriate filtering rules, and incorporating the value of robustness as training data. The results demonstrate the thoroughness of the proposed CNN framework in addressing the challenges of high computational time across various network types, failure component types and failure scenarios. However, the performance of the proposed CNN model varies: for evaluation tasks that are consistent with the trained network type, the proposed CNN model consistently achieves accurate evaluations of both attack curves and robustness values across all removal scenarios. When the predicted network type differs from the trained network, the CNN model still demonstrates favorable performance in the scenario of random node failure, showcasing its scalability and performance transferability. Nevertheless, the performance falls short of expectations in other removal scenarios. This observed scenario-sensitivity in the evaluation of network features has been overlooked in previous studies and necessitates further attention and optimization. Lastly, we discuss important unresolved questions and further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables, journal</p></details> |

For instance, we can provide an intuition of why spatial data is special by stating that, on average, spatial data samples contain less than expected information. Similarly, spatial data, e.g., remotely sensed imagery, that is easy to compress is also likely to show significant spatial autocorrelation. Formulating our (highly specific) core concepts of spatial information theory in the widely used language of information theory opens new perspectives on their differences and similarities and also fosters cross-disciplinary collaboration, e.g., with the broader AI/ML communities. Interestingly, however, this intuitive relation is challenging to formalize and generalize, leading prior work to rely mostly on experimental results, e.g., for describing landscape patterns. In this work, we will explore the information theoretical roots of spatial autocorrelation, more specifically Moran's I, through the lens of self-information (also known as surprisal) and provide both formal proofs and experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>COSIT...</summary><p>COSIT-2024 Conference Proceedings</p></details> |

Drawing inspiration from the expressive capabilities of 3D Gaussian Splatting in multi-view image reconstruction, we model the continuous flow velocity as a weighted sum of multiple Gaussian functions. Leveraging this representation, we derive differential operators for the field and implement a time-dependent PDE solver using the traditional operator splitting method. Compared to implicit neural representations as another continuous spatial representation with increasing attention, our method with flexible 3D Gaussians presents enhanced accuracy on vorticity preservation. Moreover, we apply physics-driven strategies to accelerate the optimization-based time integration of Gaussian functions. This temporal evolution surpasses previous work based on implicit neural representation with reduced computational time and memory. Although not surpassing the quality of state-of-the-art Eulerian methods in fluid simulation, experiments and ablation studies indicate the potential of our memory-efficient representation. With enriched spatial information, our method exhibits a distinctive perspective combining the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging our recently developed Concentric Tube Steerable Drilling Robot (CT-SDR) in integration with a robotic manipulator, to address the aforementioned issue, here we introduce the transformative concept of Spatial Spinal Fixation (SSF) using a unique Flexible Pedicle Screw (FPS). The proposed SSF procedure enables planar and out-of-plane placement of the FPS throughout the full volume of the vertebral body. In other words, not only does our fixation system provide the option of drilling in-plane and out-of-plane trajectories, it also enables implanting the FPS inside linear (represented by an I-shape) and/or non-linear (represented by J-shape) trajectories. To thoroughly evaluate the functionality of our proposed robotic system and the SSF procedure, we have performed various experiments by drilling different I-J and J-J drilling trajectory pairs into our custom-designed L3 vertebral phantoms and analyzed the accuracy of the procedure using various metrics.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |

To answer the proposed query type, we propose the QQESPM algorithm, which adapts the state-of-the-art ESPM algorithm to handle connectivity constraints. Performance tests comparing QQESPM to a baseline approach demonstrate QQESPM's superiority in addressing the proposed query type.</p></details> | <details><summary>DBLP ...</summary><p>DBLP Entry: https://dblp.org/rec/conf/geoinfo/MinervinoCOS23.html Conference Repository: http://urlib.net/ibi/8JMKD3MGPDW34P/4ADBK2H Accepted for the Brazilian Symposium on Geoinformatics (GEOINFO 2023)</p></details> |

Our investigation navigates the intriguing terrain of whether LLMs, despite their non-embodied nature, effectively capture implicit human intuitions about fundamental, spatial building blocks of language. We employ insights from spatial cognitive foundations developed through early sensorimotor experiences, guiding our exploration through the reproduction of three psycholinguistic experiments. Surprisingly, correlations between model outputs and human responses emerge, revealing adaptability without a tangible connection to embodied experiences. Notable distinctions include polarized language model responses and reduced correlations in vision language models. This research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between language, spatial experiences, and the computations made by large language models.

| **[Cross-modal Diffusion Modelling for Super-resolved Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12973v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of spatial transcriptomics (ST) allows to characterize spatial gene expression within tissue for discovery research. However, current ST platforms suffer from low resolution, hindering in-depth understanding of spatial gene expression. Super-resolution approaches promise to enhance ST maps by integrating histology images with gene expressions of profiled tissue spots. However, current super-resolution methods are limited by restoration uncertainty and mode collapse. Although diffusion models have shown promise in capturing complex interactions between multi-modal conditions, it remains a challenge to integrate histology images and gene expression for super-resolved ST maps. This paper proposes a cross-modal conditional diffusion model for super-resolving ST maps with the guidance of histology images. Specifically, we design a multi-modal disentangling network with cross-modal adaptive modulation to utilize complementary information from histology images and spatial gene expression. Moreover, we propose a dynamic cross-attention modelling strategy to extract hierarchical cell-to-tissue information from histology images. Lastly, we propose a co-expression-based gene-correlation graph network to model the co-expression relationship of multiple genes. Experiments show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in ST super-resolution on three public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tilt your Head: Activating the Hidden Spatial-Invariance of Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03730v2)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are applied in more and more areas of everyday life. However, they still lack essential abilities, such as robustly dealing with spatially transformed input signals. Approaches to mitigate this severe robustness issue are limited to two pathways: Either models are implicitly regularised by increased sample variability (data augmentation) or explicitly constrained by hard-coded inductive biases. The limiting factor of the former is the size of the data space, which renders sufficient sample coverage intractable. The latter is limited by the engineering effort required to develop such inductive biases for every possible scenario. Instead, we take inspiration from human behaviour, where percepts are modified by mental or physical actions during inference. We propose a novel technique to emulate such an inference process for neural nets. This is achieved by traversing a sparsified inverse transformation tree during inference using parallel energy-based evaluations. Our proposed inference algorithm, called Inverse Transformation Search (ITS), is model-agnostic and equips the model with zero-shot pseudo-invariance to spatially transformed inputs. We evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets, including a synthesised ImageNet test set. ITS outperforms the utilised baselines on all zero-shot test scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Radiotherapy Planning with Spatially Based Uncertainty Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17040v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiotherapy treatment planning is a challenging large-scale optimization problem plagued by uncertainty. Following the robust optimization methodology, we propose a novel, spatially based uncertainty set for robust modeling of radiotherapy planning, producing solutions that are immune to unexpected changes in biological conditions. Our proposed uncertainty set realistically captures biological radiosensitivity patterns that are observed using recent advances in imaging, while its parameters can be personalized for individual patients. We exploit the structure of this set to devise a compact reformulation of the robust model. We develop a row-generation scheme to solve real, large-scale instances of the robust model. This method is then extended to a relaxation-based scheme for enforcing challenging, yet clinically important, dose-volume cardinality constraints. The computational performance of our algorithms, as well as the quality and robustness of the computed treatment plans, are demonstrated on simulated and real imaging data. Based on accepted performance measures, such as minimal target dose and homogeneity, these examples demonstrate that the spatially robust model achieves almost the same performance as the nominal model in the nominal scenario, and otherwise, the spatial model outperforms both the nominal and the box-uncertainty models.</p></details> |  |

Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. The synthesized multi-view consistent 4D image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and diverse 4D assets within just several minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/Diffusion4D</p></details> |

In this paper we present BAT, which combines the spatial sound perception ability of a binaural acoustic scene analysis model with the natural language reasoning capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to replicate this innate ability. To address the lack of existing datasets of in-the-wild spatial sounds, we synthesized a binaural audio dataset using AudioSet and SoundSpaces 2.0. Next, we developed SpatialSoundQA, a spatial sound-based question-answering dataset, offering a range of QA tasks that train BAT in various aspects of spatial sound perception and reasoning. The acoustic front end encoder of BAT is a novel spatial audio encoder named Spatial Audio Spectrogram Transformer, or Spatial-AST, which by itself achieves strong performance across sound event detection, spatial localization, and distance estimation. By integrating Spatial-AST with LLaMA-2 7B model, BAT transcends standard Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) tasks, enabling the model to reason about the relationships between the sounds in its environment. Our experiments demonstrate BAT's superior performance on both spatial sound perception and reasoning, showcasing the immense potential of LLMs in navigating and interpreting complex spatial audio environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024.

With the mature high-speed transceivers and advanced (de)multiplexing techniques designed for fiber optics, fiber-coupled OWC can be seamlessly integrated into existing ultra-high-speed networks such as data centres. In particular, OWC leveraging spatial mode multiplexing (SMM) and few-mode fiber (FMF) coupling can significantly increase capacity, though misalignment may reduce performance. This paper presents a thorough investigation into the SMM-enabled FMF coupling OWC systems affected by link misalignment, specifically focusing on systems with intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) receivers. A theoretical analysis is conducted to assess the fiber coupling efficiency of the considered system in the presence of both pointing error and angle of arrival (AOA) fluctuations caused by random device vibrations. Our model elucidates the dependence of coupling efficiency to the order of the incident modes, highlighting the critical role of beam properties in system performance. To mitigate the intermodal crosstalk arising from link misalignment, we employ zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) to enhance the overall aggregated data rate. Through extensive numerical results, we identify optimal system configurations encompassing aperture design and mode selection, leading to a capacity boost exceeding 200%.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |

One critical aspect is formulating a consistency constraint specifically for temporal-spatial illumination and appearance enhanced versions, a dimension overlooked in existing methods. In this paper, we present an innovative video Retinex-based decomposition strategy that operates without the need for explicit supervision to delineate illumination and reflectance components. We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for intrinsic appearance and enforce a scene-level continuity constraint on the illumination field to yield satisfactory consistent decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a novel cross-frame interaction mechanism. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features, thus achieving the desired temporal propagation. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios. Our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |

However, inherent physical and technical constraints of imaging hardware often necessitate a compromise between temporal resolution and image quality. Frame interpolation emerges as a pivotal solution to this challenge. Previous methods often suffer from discretion when they estimate the intermediate motion and execute the forward warping. In this study, we draw inspiration from fluid mechanics to propose a novel approach for continuously modeling patient anatomic motion using implicit neural representation. It ensures both spatial and temporal continuity, effectively bridging Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications together to naturally facilitate continuous frame interpolation. Our experiments across multiple datasets underscore the method's superior accuracy and speed. Furthermore, as a case-specific optimization (training-free) approach, it circumvents the need for extensive datasets and addresses model generalization issues.</p></details> |  |

However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing benchmarks reveal shortcomings in evaluating qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR). These benchmarks typically present oversimplified scenarios or unclear natural language descriptions, hindering effective evaluation. We present a novel benchmark for assessing QSR in LMs, which is grounded in realistic 3D simulation data, offering a series of diverse room layouts with various objects and their spatial relationships. This approach provides a more detailed and context-rich narrative for spatial reasoning evaluation, diverging from traditional, toy-task-oriented scenarios. Our benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of qualitative spatial relationships, including topological, directional, and distance relations. These are presented with different viewing points, varied granularities, and density of relation constraints to mimic real-world complexities. A key contribution is our logic-based consistency-checking tool, which enables the assessment of multiple plausible solutions, aligning with real-world scenarios where spatial relationships are often open to interpretation. Our benchmark evaluation of advanced LMs reveals their strengths and limitations in spatial reasoning.

Determining how much to trust predictions made by statistical or physical methods is essential for the credibility of scientific conclusions. Unfortunately, classical approaches for validation fail to handle mismatch between locations available for validation and (test) locations where we want to make predictions. This mismatch is often not an instance of covariate shift (as commonly formalized) because the validation and test locations are fixed (e.g., on a grid or at select points) rather than i.i.d. from two distributions. In the present work, we formalize a check on validation methods: that they become arbitrarily accurate as validation data becomes arbitrarily dense. We show that classical and covariate-shift methods can fail this check. We instead propose a method that builds from existing ideas in the covariate-shift literature, but adapts them to the validation data at hand. We prove that our proposal passes our check. And we demonstrate its advantages empirically on simulated and real data.</p></details> | 52 pages, 14 figures |

Utilizing domain knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these kinds of domain knowledge separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more in-depth long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. The SSUMamba can exploit complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Zigzag Scan (SSAZS) strategy for HSIs, which helps exploit the continuous information flow in multiple directions of 3-D characteristics within HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparison methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |

The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video.

| **[Synergizing Spatial Optimization with Large Language Models for Open-Domain Urban Itinerary Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07204v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), a paradigm designed to generate personalized urban itineraries from user requests articulated in natural language. This approach is different from traditional itinerary planning, which often restricts the granularity of user inputs, thus hindering genuine personalization. To this end, we present ItiNera, an OUIP system that synergizes spatial optimization with large language models (LLMs) to provide services that customize urban itineraries based on users' needs. Upon receiving the user's itinerary request, the LLM first decomposes it into detailed components, identifying key requirements, including preferences and dislikes. Then, we use these specifics to select candidate POIs from a large-scale collection using embedding-based Preference-aware POI Retrieval. Finally, a preference score-based Cluster-aware Spatial Optimization module clusters, filters, and orders these POIs, followed by the LLM for detailed POI selection and organization to craft a personalized, spatially coherent itinerary. Moreover, we created an LLM-based pipeline to update and personalize a user-owned POI database. This ensures up-to-date POI information, supports itinerary planning, pre-trip research, POI collection, recommendations, and more. To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first integration of LLMs to innovate itinerary planning, with potential extensions for various urban travel and exploration activities. Offline and online evaluations demonstrate the capacity of our system to deliver more responsive, personalized, and spatially coherent itineraries than current solutions. Our system, deployed on an online platform, has attracted thousands of users for their urban travel planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Create New Knowledge for Spatial Reasoning Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14379v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate new information offers a potential step change for research and innovation. This is challenging to assert as it can be difficult to determine what an LLM has previously seen during training, making "newness" difficult to substantiate. In this paper we observe that LLMs are able to perform sophisticated reasoning on problems with a spatial dimension, that they are unlikely to have previously directly encountered. While not perfect, this points to a significant level of understanding that state-of-the-art LLMs can now achieve, supporting the proposition that LLMs are able to yield significant emergent properties. In particular, Claude 3 is found to perform well in this regard.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAMBA4D: Efficient Long-Sequence Point Cloud Video Understanding with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14338v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos effectively capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing 3D world we live in. Although static 3D point cloud processing has witnessed significant advancements, designing an effective 4D point cloud video backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Moreover, recent state-of-the-art 4D backbones predominantly rely on transformer-based architectures, which commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly when processing long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4D point cloud video understanding backbone based on the recently advanced State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, our backbone begins by disentangling space and time in raw 4D sequences, and then establishing spatio-temporal correlations using our newly developed Intra-frame Spatial Mamba and Inter-frame Temporal Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is designed to encode locally similar or related geometric structures within a certain temporal searching stride, which can effectively capture short-term dynamics. Subsequently, these locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which globally integrates point features across the entire video with linear complexity, further establishing long-range motion dependencies. Experimental results on human action recognition and 4D semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Especially, for long video sequences, our proposed Mamba-based method has an 87.5% GPU memory reduction, 5.36 times speed-up, and much higher accuracy (up to +10.4%) compared with transformer-based counterparts on MSR-Action3D dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Spatially Adaptive Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09071v4)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question, we investigate the theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency among nodes. These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation. Notably, our SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily. Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Typically, exposure to air pollution for an individual is measured at their home geographic region, though people travel to different regions with potentially different levels of air pollution. To account for this, we incorporate estimates of the mobility of individuals from cell phone mobility data to get an improved estimate of their exposure to air pollution. We treat this as an interference problem, where individuals in one geographic region can be affected by exposures in other regions due to mobility into those areas. We propose policy-relevant estimands and derive expressions showing the extent of bias one would obtain by ignoring this mobility. We additionally highlight the benefits of the proposed interference framework relative to a measurement error framework for accounting for mobility. We develop novel estimation strategies to estimate causal effects that account for this spatial spillover utilizing flexible Bayesian methodology. Lastly, we use the proposed methodology to study the health effects of ambient air pollution on mortality among Medicare enrollees in the United States.</p></details> |  |

Traditional hashing methods, primarily based on deep learning, often fail to capture spatial information adequately and lack transparency. In this paper, we introduce NeuroHash, a novel neuro-symbolic framework leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to enable highly customizable, spatially-aware image retrieval. NeuroHash combines pre-trained deep neural network models with HDC-based symbolic models, allowing for flexible manipulation of hash values to support conditional image retrieval. Our method includes a self-supervised context-aware HDC encoder and novel loss terms for optimizing lower-dimensional bipolar hashing using multilinear hyperplanes. We evaluate NeuroHash on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art hashing methods, as measured by mAP@5K scores and our newly introduced metric, mAP@5Kr, which assesses spatial alignment. The results highlight NeuroHash's ability to achieve competitive performance while offering significant advantages in flexibility and customization, paving the way for more advanced and versatile image retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian Process (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data. It is well known that this approach becomes computationally infeasible when dealing with large data volumes, necessitating the use of approximate methods. A powerful class of methods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random coefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does not inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the basis functions can be "normalized" to maintain a constant marginal variance, avoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of nearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets, providing a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems. Unfortunately, the process of normalizing these basis functions is computationally demanding. To address this, we introduce two fast and accurate algorithms to the normalization step, allowing for efficient prediction on fine grids. The practical value of these algorithms is showcased in the context of a spatial analysis on a large dataset, where significant computational speedups are achieved. While implementation and testing are done specifically within the LatticeKrig framework, these algorithms can be adapted to other basis function methods operating on regular grids.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Spatial Discretization Error on Coarse CFD Simulations Using an OpenFOAM-Embedded Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07441v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for reducing the spatial discretization error of coarse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by enhancing the quality of low-resolution simulations using a deep learning model fed with high-quality data. We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the fine-mesh data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error to about 50% for simulations outside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver in the x- and y-velocity components using an 8x coarser mesh. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics while generating stable predictions for mid-term simulations.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods are limited in highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving.</p></details> | Submitted to KR 2024 |
| **[SAM-CLIP: Merging Vision Foundation Models towards Semantic and Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15308v3)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of publicly available vision foundation models (VFMs), such as CLIP and Segment Anything Model (SAM), is expanding rapidly. VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The unlabeled data consisting of both normal and abnormal data is not well explored. We introduce a novel Spatial-aware Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) for one-class semi-supervised generation of health images.Our core insight is the utilization of position encoding and attention to accurately focus on restoring abnormal regions and preserving normal regions. To fully utilize the unlabelled data, SAGAN relaxes the cyclic consistency requirement of the existing unpaired image-to-image conversion methods, and generates high-quality health images corresponding to unlabeled data, guided by the reconstruction of normal images and restoration of pseudo-anomaly images.Subsequently, the discrepancy between the generated healthy image and the original image is utilized as an anomaly score.Extensive experiments on three medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accept by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Our analysis identifies a pattern of interconnected, multi-faceted tasks encompassing both AI and general computational processes. In response, we have conceptualized "Orchestrated AI Workflows," an approach that integrates various tasks with logic-driven decisions into dynamic, sophisticated workflows. Specifically, we find that the intrinsic Dual Dynamicity of Orchestrated AI Workflows, namely dynamic execution times and frequencies of Task Blocks, can be effectively represented using the Orchestrated Workflow Graph. Furthermore, the intrinsic Dual Dynamicity poses challenges to existing spatial architecture, namely Indiscriminate Resource Allocation, Reactive Load Rebalancing, and Contagious PEA Idleness. To overcome these challenges, we present Octopus, a scale-out spatial architecture and a suite of advanced scheduling strategies optimized for executing Orchestrated AI Workflows, such as the Discriminate Dual-Scheduling Mechanism, Adaptive TBU Scheduling Strategy, and Proactive Cluster Scheduling Strategy. Our evaluations demonstrate that Octopus significantly outperforms traditional architectures in handling the dynamic demands of Orchestrated AI Workflows, and possesses robust scalability in large scale hardware such as wafer-scale chip.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisenStudio: Customized Multi-subject Text-to-Video Generation with Disentangled Spatial Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12796v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating customized content in videos has received increasing attention recently. However, existing works primarily focus on customized text-to-video generation for single subject, suffering from subject-missing and attribute-binding problems when the video is expected to contain multiple subjects. Furthermore, existing models struggle to assign the desired actions to the corresponding subjects (action-binding problem), failing to achieve satisfactory multi-subject generation performance. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose DisenStudio, a novel framework that can generate text-guided videos for customized multiple subjects, given few images for each subject. Specifically, DisenStudio enhances a pretrained diffusion-based text-to-video model with our proposed spatial-disentangled cross-attention mechanism to associate each subject with the desired action. Then the model is customized for the multiple subjects with the proposed motion-preserved disentangled finetuning, which involves three tuning strategies: multi-subject co-occurrence tuning, masked single-subject tuning, and multi-subject motion-preserved tuning. The first two strategies guarantee the subject occurrence and preserve their visual attributes, and the third strategy helps the model maintain the temporal motion-generation ability when finetuning on static images. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate our proposed DisenStudio significantly outperforms existing methods in various metrics. Additionally, we show that DisenStudio can be used as a powerful tool for various controllable generation applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[SARA: Controllable Makeup Transfer with Spatial Alignment and Region-Adaptive Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16828v2)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Makeup transfer is a process of transferring the makeup style from a reference image to the source images, while preserving the source images' identities. This technique is highly desirable and finds many applications. However, existing methods lack fine-level control of the makeup style, making it challenging to achieve high-quality results when dealing with large spatial misalignments. To address this problem, we propose a novel Spatial Alignment and Region-Adaptive normalization method (SARA) in this paper. Our method generates detailed makeup transfer results that can handle large spatial misalignments and achieve part-specific and shade-controllable makeup transfer. Specifically, SARA comprises three modules: Firstly, a spatial alignment module that preserves the spatial context of makeup and provides a target semantic map for guiding the shape-independent style codes. Secondly, a region-adaptive normalization module that decouples shape and makeup style using per-region encoding and normalization, which facilitates the elimination of spatial misalignments. Lastly, a makeup fusion module blends identity features and makeup style by injecting learned scale and bias parameters. Experimental results show that our SARA method outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Models for Crowdsourced Internet Access Network Performance Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11138v2)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant investments in access network infrastructure, universal access to high-quality Internet connectivity remains a challenge. Policymakers often rely on large-scale, crowdsourced measurement datasets to assess the distribution of access network performance across geographic areas. These decisions typically rest on the assumption that Internet performance is uniformly distributed within predefined social boundaries, such as zip codes, census tracts, or community areas. However, this assumption may not be valid for two reasons: (1) crowdsourced measurements often exhibit non-uniform sampling densities within geographic areas; and (2) predefined social boundaries may not align with the actual boundaries of Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we model Internet performance as a spatial process. We apply and evaluate a series of statistical techniques to: (1) aggregate Internet performance over a geographic region; (2) overlay interpolated maps with various sampling boundary choices; and (3) spatially cluster boundary units to identify areas with similar performance characteristics. We evaluated the effectiveness of these using a 17-month-long crowdsourced dataset from Ookla Speedtest. We evaluate several leading interpolation methods at varying spatial scales. Further, we examine the similarity between the resulting boundaries for smaller realizations of the dataset. Our findings suggest that our combination of techniques achieves a 56% gain in similarity score over traditional methods that rely on aggregates over raw measurement values for performance summarization. Our work highlights an urgent need for more sophisticated strategies in understanding and addressing Internet access disparities.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and Modal Optimal Transport for Fast Cross-Modal MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02774v3)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in comprehensive disease diagnosis in clinical medicine. However, acquiring certain modalities, such as T2-weighted images (T2WIs), is time-consuming and prone to be with motion artifacts. It negatively impacts subsequent multi-modal image analysis. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that utilizes T1-weighted images (T1WIs) as auxiliary modalities to expedite T2WIs' acquisitions. While image pre-processing is capable of mitigating misalignment, improper parameter selection leads to adverse pre-processing effects, requiring iterative experimentation and adjustment. To overcome this shortage, we employ Optimal Transport (OT) to synthesize T2WIs by aligning T1WIs and performing cross-modal synthesis, effectively mitigating spatial misalignment effects. Furthermore, we adopt an alternating iteration framework between the reconstruction task and the cross-modal synthesis task to optimize the final results. Then, we prove that the reconstructed T2WIs and the synthetic T2WIs become closer on the T2 image manifold with iterations increasing, and further illustrate that the improved reconstruction result enhances the synthesis process, whereas the enhanced synthesis result improves the reconstruction process. Finally, experimental results from FastMRI and internal datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating significant improvements in image reconstruction quality even at low sampling rates.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.

Existing methods compute the similarity between the query image and exemplars in the 2D spatial domain and perform regression to obtain the counting number. However, these methods overlook the rich information about the spatial distribution of similarity on the exemplar images, leading to significant impact on matching accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a network learning Spatial Similarity Distribution (SSD) for few-shot object counting, which preserves the spatial structure of exemplar features and calculates a 4D similarity pyramid point-to-point between the query features and exemplar features, capturing the complete distribution information for each point in the 4D similarity space. We propose a Similarity Learning Module (SLM) which applies the efficient center-pivot 4D convolutions on the similarity pyramid to map different similarity distributions to distinct predicted density values, thereby obtaining accurate count. Furthermore, we also introduce a Feature Cross Enhancement (FCE) module that enhances query and exemplar features mutually to improve the accuracy of feature matching. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, including FSC-147 and CARPK.

The existing video adversarial attack methods mainly take a gradient-based approach and generate adversarial videos with noticeable perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Adversarial Video Attack via Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Networks (SVASTIN) to generate adversarial videos through spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging. It consists of a Guided Target Video Learning (GTVL) module to balance the perturbation budget and optimization speed and a Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Network (STIN) module to perform spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging between a source video and the target feature tensor learned by GTVL module. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our proposed SVASTIN can generate adversarial examples with higher imperceptibility than the state-of-the-art methods with the higher fooling rate.

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

We infer mechanisms with a Bayesian hierarchical dyadic model that scales well with large data sets and that accounts for spatial and temporal dependence. We construct a fully-connected network comprising spatio-temporal data for the dyadic model and use normalized composite likelihoods to account for the dependence structure in space and time.

To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic study on existing shortcomings faced by off-the-shelf models, including lack of local fidelity, poor prediction performance over long time-steps,low scalability, and inefficiency. To systematically address the aforementioned problems, we propose an EarthFarseer, a concise framework that combines parallel local convolutions and global Fourier-based transformer architectures, enabling dynamically capture the local-global spatial interactions and dependencies. EarthFarseer also incorporates a multi-scale fully convolutional and Fourier architectures to efficiently and effectively capture the temporal evolution. Our proposal demonstrates strong adaptability across various tasks and datasets, with fast convergence and better local fidelity in long time-steps predictions. Extensive experiments and visualizations over eight human society physical and natural physical datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of EarthFarseer. We release our code at https://github.com/easylearningscores/EarthFarseer.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, methods for predicting and preventing traffic accidents have been researched for many years. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, various studies have applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to traffic accident prediction. Modern traffic conditions change rapidly by the minute, and these changes vary significantly across different roads. In other words, the risk of traffic accidents changes minute by minute in various patterns for each road. Therefore, it is desirable to predict traffic accident risk at the Minute-Level and Road-Level. However, because roads have close and complex relationships with adjacent roads, research on predicting traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level is challenging. Thus, it is essential to build a model that can reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of roads for traffic accident prediction. Consequently, recent attempts have been made to use Graph Convolutional Networks to capture the spatial characteristics of roads and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture their temporal characteristics for predicting traffic accident risk. This paper proposes the Sequential based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (SST-GCN), which combines GCN and LSTM, to predict traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level using a road dataset constructed in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Experiments have demonstrated that SST-GCN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in Minute-Level predictions.</p></details> |  |

However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that S$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S$^2$GNNs scale to millions of nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 27 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Encoding of Brain Dynamics with Surface Masked Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05474v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of robust and generalisable models for encoding the spatio-temporal dynamics of human brain activity is crucial for advancing neuroscientific discoveries. However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications for MIDL 2024; 20 figures; 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00405v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the integrated-fire-leak mechanism found in biological neurons, offering a compelling combination of biological realism and energy efficiency. In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the golden standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the first publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

Considering the sparsity of data due to the high maintenance cost of the stations, good inference algorithms can effectively save the cost and refine the data granularity. While spatio-temporal graph neural networks have made excellent progress on this problem, their non-Euclidean and discrete data structure modeling of reality limits its potential. In this work, we make the first attempt to combine two different spatio-temporal perspectives, fields and graphs, by proposing a new model, Spatio-Temporal Field Neural Network, and its corresponding new framework, Pyramidal Inference.

The primary challenge in achieving precise load forecasting for EVCS lies in accounting for the nonlinear of charging behaviors, the spatial interactions among different stations, and the intricate temporal variations in usage patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model (MSTEM) for effective load forecasting at EVCS. MSTEM incorporates a multiscale graph neural network to discern hierarchical nonlinear temporal dependencies across various time scales. Besides, it also integrates a recurrent learning component and a residual fusion mechanism, enhancing its capability to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations in charging patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MSTEM has been validated through comparative analysis with six baseline models using three evaluation metrics. The case studies utilize real-world datasets for both fast and slow charging loads at EVCS in Perth, UK. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MSTEM in short-term continuous load forecasting for EVCS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, AEEES 2024</p></details> |

Models for this task are usually trained with human-annotated sentences and bounding box supervision. This work addresses this task from a multimodal supervision perspective, proposing a framework for spatio-temporal action grounding trained on loose video and subtitle supervision only, without human annotation. To this end, we combine local representation learning, which focuses on leveraging fine-grained spatial information, with a global representation encoding that captures higher-level representations and incorporates both in a joint approach. To evaluate this challenging task in a real-life setting, a new benchmark dataset is proposed providing dense spatio-temporal grounding annotations in long, untrimmed, multi-action instructional videos for over 5K events. We evaluate the proposed approach and other methods on the proposed and standard downstream tasks showing that our method improves over current baselines in various settings, including spatial, temporal, and untrimmed multi-action spatio-temporal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at CVPR 2024.

However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | Accepted by Chaos |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over the large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the dynamic evolution of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose a two-stage spatio-temporal graph neural network (STGNN) framework. The first stage uses a pre-trained STGNN to process telecom data, while the second stage integrates directional and geographic insights for accurate prediction. Our experiments demonstrate the framework's compatibility with various STGNN models and confirm its effectiveness.

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures |

We investigate conditions under which estimation is feasible and of good overall quality and obtain sharp approximations that we employ to devising statistical inference methodology. These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences.

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |

Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

However, prevailing methodologies, often focusing on synchronous BOLD signals from functional MRI (fMRI), may not capture directional influences among brain regions and rarely tackle temporal functional dynamics. In this study, we first construct the brain-effective network via the dynamic causal model. Subsequently, we introduce an interpretable graph learning framework termed Spatio-Temporal Embedding ODE (STE-ODE). This framework incorporates specifically designed directed node embedding layers, aiming at capturing the dynamic interplay between structural and effective networks via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which characterizes spatial-temporal brain dynamics. Our framework is validated on several clinical phenotype prediction tasks using two independent publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published to the conference of NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p></details> |  |

Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the US, which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood hematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukemia and lymphoma.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tidy Framework and Infrastructure to Systematically Assemble Spatio-temporal Indexes from Multivariate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05812v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |

They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Despite significant strides in ST modeling in recent years, there remains a need to emphasize harnessing the potential of information from different modalities. Robust MoST forecasting is more challenging because it possesses (i) high-dimensional and complex internal structures and (ii) dynamic heterogeneity caused by temporal, spatial, and modality variations. In this study, we propose a novel MoST learning framework via Self-Supervised Learning, namely MoSSL, which aims to uncover latent patterns from temporal, spatial, and modality perspectives while quantifying dynamic heterogeneity. Experiment results on two real-world MoST datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

As one of the important application domains of foundation models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture, earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation models. Specifically, for transfer learning of the land cover downstream task on the PhilEO Bench dataset, it shows 10.4\% higher accuracy compared with other geospatial foundation models on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint covariance properties under geometric image transformations for spatio-temporal receptive fields according to the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10543v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of natural image transformations on receptive field responses is crucial for modelling visual operations in computer vision and biological vision. In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations, which make it possible to characterize how different types of image transformations interact with each other and the associated spatio-temporal receptive field responses. In this regard, we also extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, to be able to obtain true affine-covariant properties of spatial derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels. The derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. As a side effect, the presented proof for the joint covariance property over the integrated combination of the different geometric image transformations also provides specific proofs for the individual transformation properties, which have not previously been fully reported in the literature. The paper also presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of geometric interpretations of the derived covariance properties, as well as outlines a number of biological interpretations of these results.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 13 figures.

In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p></details> |  |

The standard and local low motion videos were the two scenarios considered in evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results obtained showed that the proposed approach achieved an improvement of 5.13%, 15.8% and 5%, 15.6% improvement in terms of the buffer size and compression ratio. Though with a tradeoff of the frame-built time, where both the standard and local frame indexing outperforms the proposed scheme with 10.8% and 8.71% respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our work primarily addresses this, introducing more realistic and flexible models for spatio-temporal random fields. We break away from the traditional confines of the classic frozen field by either relaxing the assumption of a single deterministic velocity or rethinking the hypothesis regarding the spectrum shape, thus enhancing the realism of our models. While the proposed models stand out for their realism and flexibility, they are also paired with simulation algorithms that are equally or less computationally complex than the commonly used circulant embedding for Gaussian random fields in $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. This combination of realistic modeling with efficient simulation methods creates an effective solution for better understanding traveling phenomena.</p></details> |  |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian predictive inference allows for coherently incorporating uncertainty about unknown quantities by making use of methods or models that produce predictive distributions, which in turn inform decision problems. By formalizing these decision problems into properties with the help of spatio-temporal logic, we can formulate and predict how likely such properties are to be satisfied in the future at a certain location. Moreover, we can leverage our methodology to evaluate and compare models directly on their ability to predict the satisfaction of application-driven properties. The approach is illustrated in an urban mobility application, where the crowdedness in the center of Milan is proxied by aggregated mobile phone traffic data. We specify several desirable spatio-temporal properties related to city crowdedness such as a fault-tolerant network or the reachability of hospitals. After verifying these properties on draws from the posterior predictive distributions, we compare several spatio-temporal Bayesian models based on their overall and property-based predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Discriminative Spatio-temporal Representations for Semi-supervised Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16416v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised action recognition aims to improve spatio-temporal reasoning ability with a few labeled data in conjunction with a large amount of unlabeled data. Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone to making ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as the limitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the model two aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporal structure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. It assesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of the labeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from a pseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlight informative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into the short-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of these two new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the model to make accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics400 show the superiority of our method over prior state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, 56 conferences</p></details> |

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the ACM for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[ICST-DNET: An Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network for Traffic Speed Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13853v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Typical fine-tuning based adaptation paradigm is prone to overfitting in the few-shot learning scenarios and offers little modeling flexibility for learning temporal features in video data. In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), which is a novel adapter tuning framework well-suited for few-shot action recognition due to lightweight design and low parameter-learning overhead. It is designed in a dual-pathway architecture to encode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner. In particular, we devise the anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention module as the core component of D$^2$ST-Adapter, which can be tailored with anisotropic sampling densities along spatial and temporal domains to learn spatial and temporal features specifically in corresponding pathways, allowing our D$^2$ST-Adapter to encode features in a global view in 3D spatio-temporal space while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments with instantiations of our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods for few-shot action recognition. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.</p></details> |  |

To identify the common drivers and extent of spatio-temporal similarity of PM2.5 and ozone, this paper proposed a log Gaussian-Gumbel Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for sharing a SPDE-AR(1) spatio-temporal interaction structure. The proposed model outperforms in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction capacity for its increased parsimony and reduced uncertainty, especially for the shared ozone sub-model. Besides the consistently significant influence of temperature (positive), extreme drought (positive), fire burnt area (positive), and wind speed (negative) on both PM2.5 and ozone, surface pressure and GDP per capita (precipitation) demonstrate only positive associations with PM2.5 (ozone), while population density relates to neither. In addition, our results show the distinct spatio-temporal interactions and different seasonal patterns of PM2.5 and ozone, with peaks of PM2.5 and ozone in cold and hot seasons, respectively. Finally, with the aid of the excursion function, we see that the areas around the intersection of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are likely to exceed the unhealthy ozone level for sensitive groups throughout the year. Our findings provide new insights for regional and seasonal strategies in the co-control of PM2.5 and ozone. Our methodology is expected to be utilized when interest lies in multiple interrelated processes in the fields of environment and epidemiology.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning (DL) approaches have gained colossal success in traffic forecasting but still face challenges in capturing the intricacies of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we identify and address this challenges by emphasizing that spatial features are inherently dynamic and change over time. A novel in-depth feature representation, called Dynamic Spatio-Temporal (Dyn-ST) features, is introduced, which encapsulates spatial characteristics across varying times. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network (DST-GTN) is proposed by capturing Dyn-ST features and other dynamic adjacency relations between intersections. The DST-GTN can model dynamic ST relationships between nodes accurately and refine the representation of global and local ST characteristics by adopting adaptive weights in low-pass and all-pass filters, enabling the extraction of Dyn-ST features from traffic time-series data. Through numerical experiments on public datasets, the DST-GTN achieves state-of-the-art performance for a range of traffic forecasting tasks and demonstrates enhanced stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal patterns of diurnal temperature: a random matrix approach I-case of India](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11747v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the spatio-temporal gridded daily diurnal temperature range (DTR) data across India during the 72-year period 1951--2022. We augment this data with information on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and on the climatic regions (Stamp's and Koeppen's classification) and four seasons of India. We use various matrix theory approaches to trim out strong but routine signals, random matrix theory to remove noise, and novel empirical generalised singular-value distributions to establish retention of essential signals in the trimmed data. We make use of the spatial Bergsma statistics to measure spatial association and identify temporal change points in the spatial-association. In particular, our investigation captures a yet unknown change-point over the 72 years under study with drastic changes in spatial-association of DTR in India. It also brings out changes in spatial association with regard to ENSO. We conclude that while studying/modelling Indian DTR data, due consideration should be granted to the strong spatial association that is being persistently exhibited over decades, and provision should be kept for potential change points in the temporal behaviour, which in turn can bring moderate to dramatic changes in the spatial association pattern. Some of our analysis also reaffirms the conclusions made by other authors, regarding spatial and temporal behavior of DTR, adding our own insights. We consider the data from the yearly, seasonal and climatic zones points of view, and discover several new and interesting statistical structures which should be of interest, especially to climatologists and statisticians. Our methods are not country specific and could be used profitably for DTR data from other geographical areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervision for LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11737v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular representation learning methods encourage feature invariance under transformations applied at the input. However, in 3D perception tasks like object localization and segmentation, outputs are naturally equivariant to some transformations, such as rotation. Using pre-training loss functions that encourage equivariance of features under certain transformations provides a strong self-supervision signal while also retaining information of geometric relationships between transformed feature representations. This can enable improved performance in downstream tasks that are equivariant to such transformations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal equivariant learning framework by considering both spatial and temporal augmentations jointly. Our experiments show that the best performance arises with a pre-training approach that encourages equivariance to translation, scaling, and flip, rotation and scene flow. For spatial augmentations, we find that depending on the transformation, either a contrastive objective or an equivariance-by-classification objective yields best results. To leverage real-world object deformations and motion, we consider sequential LiDAR scene pairs and develop a novel 3D scene flow-based equivariance objective that leads to improved performance overall. We show our pre-training method for 3D object detection which outperforms existing equivariant and invariant approaches in many settings.</p></details> | technical report |

Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos/code available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatio-temporal model to detect potential outliers in disease mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09882v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal disease mapping models are commonly used to estimate the relative risk of a disease over time and across areas. For each area and time point, the disease count is modelled with a Poisson distribution whose mean is the product of an offset and the disease relative risk. This relative risk is commonly decomposed in the log scale as the sum of fixed and latent effects. The Rushworth model allows for spatio-temporal autocorrelation of the random effects. We build on the Rushworth model to accommodate and identify potentially outlying areas with respect to their disease relative risk evolution, after taking into account the fixed effects. An area may display outlying behaviour at some points in time but not all. At each time point, we assume the latent effects to be spatially structured and include scaling parameters in the precision matrix, to allow for heavy-tails. Two prior specifications are considered for the scaling parameters: one where they are independent across space and one with spatial autocorrelation. We investigate the performance of the different prior specifications of the proposed model through simulation studies and analyse the weekly evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases across the 33 boroughs of Montreal and the 96 French departments during the second wave. In Montreal, 6 boroughs are found to be potentially outlying. In France, the model with spatially structured scaling parameters identified 21 departments as potential outliers. We find that these departments tend to be close to each other and within common French regions.</p></details> |  |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.11% SeK; and on the BDA dataset xBD, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD</p></details> |  |

Addressing this distinctive attribute, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal CNN-Transformer network (MSSTNet). Our approach takes spatial features of different scales extracted by CNN and feeds them into a Multi-scale Embedding Layer (MELayer). The MELayer extracts multi-scale spatial information and encodes these features before sending them into a Temporal Transformer (T-Former). The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |

Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |

However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |

While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + appendix (21 pages total)</p></details> |

This paper addresses a critical limitation in current video grounding methodologies by introducing an Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task. Unlike prevalent closed-set approaches that struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to limited training data and predefined vocabularies, our model leverages pre-trained representations from foundational spatial grounding models. This empowers it to effectively bridge the semantic gap between natural language and diverse visual content, achieving strong performance in closed-set and open-vocabulary settings. Our contributions include a novel spatio-temporal video grounding model, surpassing state-of-the-art results in closed-set evaluations on multiple datasets and demonstrating superior performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Notably, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in closed-set settings on VidSTG (Declarative and Interrogative) and HC-STVG (V1 and V2) datasets. Furthermore, in open-vocabulary evaluations on HC-STVG V1 and YouCook-Interactions, our model surpasses the recent best-performing models by $4.88$ m_vIoU and $1.83\%$ accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling diverse linguistic and visual concepts for improved video understanding.

Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 75.1% on Kinetics-600.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

To correctly exploit the provided information by each sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure. We demonstrate that our approach works on outdoor urban scenes by validating it on multiple established driving datasets. Results show that our method is able to get better accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024.

| **[Spatio-temporal load shifting for truly clean computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00036v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Companies with datacenters are procuring significant amounts of renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprint. There is increasing interest in achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) matching in electricity usage, aiming to eliminate all carbon footprints associated with electricity consumption on an hourly basis. However, the variability of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for achieving this goal. We explore the impact of shifting computing jobs and associated power loads both in time and between datacenter locations. We develop an optimization model to simulate a network of geographically distributed datacenters managed by a company leveraging spatio-temporal load flexibility to achieve 24/7 CFE matching. We isolate three signals relevant for informed use of load flexiblity: varying average quality of renewable energy resources, low correlation between wind power generation over long distances due to different weather conditions, and lags in solar radiation peak due to Earth's rotation. We illustrate that the location of datacenters and the time of year affect which signal drives an effective load-shaping strategy. The energy procurement and load-shifting decisions based on informed use of these signals facilitate the resource-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of clean computing -- the costs of 24/7 CFE are reduced by 1.29$\pm$0.07 EUR/MWh for every additional percentage of flexible load. We provide practical guidelines on how companies with datacenters can leverage spatio-temporal load flexibility for truly clean computing. Our results and the open-source optimization model can also be useful for a broader variety of companies with flexible loads and an interest in eliminating their carbon footprint.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Few-Shot Learning via Diffusive Neural Network Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11922v3)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal modeling is foundational for smart city applications, yet it is often hindered by data scarcity in many cities and regions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction. The implementation of our approach is available: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GPD.</p></details> |  |

Malicious users can easily create non-existent videos to spread false information. This letter proposes an effective AI-generated video detection (AIGVDet) scheme by capturing the forensic traces with a two-branch spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, two ResNet sub-detectors are learned separately for identifying the anomalies in spatical and optical flow domains, respectively. Results of such sub-detectors are fused to further enhance the discrimination ability. A large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) is constructed as a benchmark for model training and evaluation. Extensive experimental results verify the high generalization and robustness of our AIGVDet scheme. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/multimediaFor/AIGVDet.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is based on learning a 3D spatio-spatial temporal convolution to create detailed pictures of forehead patterns. We introduce a new CNN model called the Forehead Spatio-Spatial Temporal Network (FH-SSTNet), which utilizes a 3D CNN architecture with triplet loss to capture distinguishing features. We enhance the model's discrimination capability using Arcloss in the network's head. Experimentation on the Forehead Creases version 1 (FH-V1) dataset, containing 247 unique subjects, demonstrates the superior performance of FH-SSTNet compared to existing methods and pre-trained CNNs like ResNet50, especially for forehead-based user verification. The results demonstrate the superior performance of FH-SSTNet for forehead-based user verification, confirming its effectiveness in identity authentication.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 Figure, IWBF conference</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15994v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting is a significant but challenging task in facial expression analysis. The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p></details> | Accepted by FG2024 |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Bi-directional Cross-frame Memory for Distractor Filtering Point Cloud Single Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15831v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D single object tracking within LIDAR point clouds is a pivotal task in computer vision, with profound implications for autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |

| **[Spatio-Temporal Proximity-Aware Dual-Path Model for Panoramic Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14113v1)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic Activity Recognition (PAR) seeks to identify diverse human activities across different scales, from individual actions to social group and global activities in crowded panoramic scenes. PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[$GRU^{spa}$: Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v3)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose a model, Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention ($GRU^{spa}$), where spatial attention layers are integrated into the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Additionally, we utilize containment relationships between different geographic levels (e.g., when a given city block is wholly contained in a given census tract) to constrain the spatial attention layers. For situations where limited historical training data is available, we study transfer learning scenarios and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that $GRU^{spa}$ provides a significant improvement over other neural models as well as typical heuristic methods, allowing us to synthesize realistic point data over small regions useful for training downstream models.</p></details> |  |

Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show a spatio-temporal relationship within ECG data.

However, maintaining a comprehensive understanding of the situation on the ground is challenging, especially in conflicts that cover vast territories and extend over long periods. This study presents a scalable and transferable method for estimating war-induced damage to buildings. We first train a machine learning model to output pixel-wise probability of destruction from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite image time series, leveraging existing, manual damage assessments as ground truth and cloud-based geospatial analysis tools for large-scale inference. We further post-process these assessments using open building footprints to obtain a final damage estimate per building. We introduce an accessible, open-source tool that allows users to adjust the confidence interval based on their specific requirements and use cases. Our approach enables humanitarian organizations and other actors to rapidly screen large geographic regions for war impacts. We provide two publicly accessible dashboards: a Ukraine Damage Explorer to dynamically view our pre-computed estimates, and a Rapid Damage Mapping Tool to easily run our method and produce custom maps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Space-Time Spectral Collocation Method for Solving the Nonlinear Convection Diffusion Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02505v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spectral methods provide highly accurate numerical solutions for partial differential equations, exhibiting exponential convergence with the number of spectral nodes. Traditionally, in addressing time-dependent nonlinear problems, attention has been on low-order finite difference schemes for time discretization and spectral element schemes for spatial variables. However, our recent developments have resulted in the application of spectral methods to both space and time variables, preserving spectral convergence in both domains. Leveraging Tensor Train techniques, our approach tackles the curse of dimensionality inherent in space-time methods. Here, we extend this methodology to the nonlinear time-dependent convection-diffusion equation. Our discretization scheme exhibits a low-rank structure, facilitating translation to tensor-train (TT) format. Nevertheless, controlling the TT-rank across Newton's iterations, needed to deal with the nonlinearity, poses a challenge, leading us to devise the "Step Truncation TT-Newton" method. We demonstrate the exponential convergence of our methods through various benchmark examples. Importantly, our scheme offers significantly reduced memory requirement compared to the full-grid scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Time Series: Bridging Predictive Power and Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02496v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) is a groundbreaking model recently proposed by the MIT team, representing a revolutionary approach with the potential to be a game-changer in the field. This innovative concept has rapidly garnered worldwide interest within the AI community. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KAN utilizes spline-parametrized univariate functions in place of traditional linear weights, enabling them to dynamically learn activation patterns and significantly enhancing interpretability. In this paper, we explore the application of KAN to time series forecasting and propose two variants: T-KAN and MT-KAN. T-KAN is designed to detect concept drift within time series and can explain the nonlinear relationships between predictions and previous time steps through symbolic regression, making it highly interpretable in dynamically changing environments. MT-KAN, on the other hand, improves predictive performance by effectively uncovering and leveraging the complex relationships among variables in multivariate time series. Experiments validate the effectiveness of these approaches, demonstrating that T-KAN and MT-KAN significantly outperform traditional methods in time series forecasting tasks, not only enhancing predictive accuracy but also improving model interpretability. This research opens new avenues for adaptive forecasting models, highlighting the potential of KAN as a powerful and interpretable tool in predictive analytics.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (TKAT), a novel attention-based architecture designed to address this task using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). Inspired by the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), TKAT emerges as a powerful encoder-decoder model tailored to handle tasks in which the observed part of the features is more important than the a priori known part. This new architecture combined the theoretical foundation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with the power of transformers. TKAT aims to simplify the complex dependencies inherent in time series, making them more "interpretable". The use of transformer architecture in this framework allows us to capture long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses a finite element discretization with a high-order time integrator coupled with the recently proposed incremental potential contact method for handling contact and friction forces to solve ODE- and PDE-constrained optimization problems on scenes with complex geometry. It supports static and dynamic problems and differentiation with respect to all physical parameters involved in the physical problem description, which include shape, material parameters, friction parameters, and initial conditions. Our analytically derived adjoint formulation is efficient, with a small overhead (typically less than 10% for nonlinear problems) over the forward simulation, and shares many similarities with the forward problem, allowing the reuse of large parts of existing forward simulator code. We implement our approach on top of the open-source PolyFEM library and demonstrate the applicability of our solver to shape design, initial condition optimization, and material estimation on both simulated results and physical validations.</p></details> |  |

Understanding of determinants of statistical power is helpful in interpreting results in publications and in analysis for causal inference. Case-crossover analysis, a matched case-control analysis, is widely used to estimate health effects of short-term exposures. Despite its widespread use, understanding of sample size, statistical power, and the accuracy and precision of the estimator in real-world data settings is very limited. First, the variance of exposures that exhibit spatiotemporal patterns may be heteroskedastic (e.g., air pollution and temperature exposures, impacted by climate change). Second, distributed lags of the exposure variable may be used to identify critical exposure time-windows. Third, exposure measurement error is not uncommon, impacting the accuracy and/or precision of the estimator, depending on the measurement error mechanism. Exposure measurement errors result in covariate measurement errors of distributed lags. All these issues complicate the understanding. Therefore, I developed approximation equations for sample size, estimates of the estimators and standard errors, and identified conditions for applications. I discussed polynomials for non-linear effect estimation. I analyzed air pollution estimates in the United States (U.S.), developed by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to examine errors, and conducted statistical simulations. Overall, sample size can be calculated based on external information about exposure variable validation, without validation data in hand. For estimators of distributed lags, calculations may perform well if residual confounding due to covariate measurement error is not severe. This condition may sometimes be difficult to identify without validation data, suggesting investigators should consider validation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for peer-reviewed publication</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Approach for Exploring Granger Connectivity in High-Dimensional Networks of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02360v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This manuscript presents a novel method for discovering effective connectivity between specified pairs of nodes in a high-dimensional network of time series. To accurately perform Granger causality analysis from the first node to the second node, it is essential to eliminate the influence of all other nodes within the network. The approach proposed is to create a low-dimensional representation of all other nodes in the network using frequency-domain-based dynamic principal component analysis (spectral DPCA). The resulting scores are subsequently removed from the first and second nodes of interest, thus eliminating the confounding effect of other nodes within the high-dimensional network. To conduct hypothesis testing on Granger causality, we propose a permutation-based causality test. This test enhances the accuracy of our findings when the error structures are non-Gaussian. The approach has been validated in extensive simulation studies, which demonstrate the efficacy of the methodology as a tool for causality analysis in complex time series networks. The proposed methodology has also been demonstrated to be both expedient and viable on real datasets, with particular success observed on multichannel EEG networks.</p></details> |  |

Application of these models to time series generation is less explored, however, and is of great utility to machine learning, privacy preservation, and explainability research. The present survey identifies this gap at the intersection of the transformer, generative AI, and time series data, and reviews works in this sparsely populated subdomain. The reviewed works show great variety in approach, and have not yet converged on a conclusive answer to the problems the domain poses. GANs, diffusion models, state space models, and autoencoders were all encountered alongside or surrounding the transformers which originally motivated the survey. While too open a domain to offer conclusive insights, the works surveyed are quite suggestive, and several recommendations for best practice, and suggestions of valuable future work, are provided.</p></details> |  |

| **[PeFAD: A Parameter-Efficient Federated Framework for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02318v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of mobile sensing techniques, huge amounts of time series data are generated and accumulated in various domains, fueling plenty of real-world applications. In this setting, time series anomaly detection is practically important. It endeavors to identify deviant samples from the normal sample distribution in time series. Existing approaches generally assume that all the time series is available at a central location. However, we are witnessing the decentralized collection of time series due to the deployment of various edge devices. To bridge the gap between the decentralized time series data and the centralized anomaly detection algorithms, we propose a Parameter-efficient Federated Anomaly Detection framework named PeFAD with the increasing privacy concerns. PeFAD for the first time employs the pre-trained language model (PLM) as the body of the client's local model, which can benefit from its cross-modality knowledge transfer capability. To reduce the communication overhead and local model adaptation cost, we propose a parameter-efficient federated training module such that clients only need to fine-tune small-scale parameters and transmit them to the server for update. PeFAD utilizes a novel anomaly-driven mask selection strategy to mitigate the impact of neglected anomalies during training. A knowledge distillation operation on a synthetic privacy-preserving dataset that is shared by all the clients is also proposed to address the data heterogeneity issue across clients. We conduct extensive evaluations on four real datasets, where PeFAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines by up to 28.74\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2024 (Research Track)</p></details> |
| **[Test-Time Regret Minimization in Meta Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02282v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta reinforcement learning sets a distribution over a set of tasks on which the agent can train at will, then is asked to learn an optimal policy for any test task efficiently. In this paper, we consider a finite set of tasks modeled through Markov decision processes with various dynamics. We assume to have endured a long training phase, from which the set of tasks is perfectly recovered, and we focus on regret minimization against the optimal policy in the unknown test task. Under a separation condition that states the existence of a state-action pair revealing a task against another, Chen et al. (2022) show that $O(M^2 \log(H))$ regret can be achieved, where $M, H$ are the number of tasks in the set and test episodes, respectively. In our first contribution, we demonstrate that the latter rate is nearly optimal by developing a novel lower bound for test-time regret minimization under separation, showing that a linear dependence with $M$ is unavoidable. Then, we present a family of stronger yet reasonable assumptions beyond separation, which we call strong identifiability, enabling algorithms achieving fast rates $\log (H)$ and sublinear dependence with $M$ simultaneously. Our paper provides a new understanding of the statistical barriers of test-time regret minimization and when fast rates can be achieved.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generative Pre-Trained Diffusion Paradigm for Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02212v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, generative pre-trained paradigms such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision Models (LVMs) have achieved revolutionary advancements and widespread real-world applications. Particularly, the emergence of pre-trained LLMs-based temporal works, compared to previous deep model approaches, has demonstrated superior generalization and robustness, showcasing the potential of generative pre-trained paradigms as foundation models for time series. However, those LLMs-based works mainly focus on cross-modal research, i.e., leveraging the language capabilities of LLMs in time series contexts. Although they have achieved impressive performance, there still exist the issues of concept drift caused by differences in data distribution and inflexibility caused by misalignment of dimensions. To this end, inspired by recent work on LVMs, we reconsider the paradigm of time series modeling. In this paper, we comprehensively explore, for the first time, the effectiveness and superiority of the Generative Pre-trained Diffusion (GPD) paradigm in real-world multivariate time series forecasting (TSF). Specifically, to mitigate performance bias introduced by sophisticated networks, we propose a straightforward MLP diffusion network for unconditional modeling of time series. Then we employ a zero-shot and tuning-free method to predict (generate) future data using historical data as prompts. The GPD paradigm is established on the time series modality, effectively preventing the phenomenon of concept drift, and enabling flexible forecasting of arbitrary lengths. We demonstrate that the GPD paradigm achieves comprehensive performance and generalization comparable to current SOTA LLM-based and deep model paradigms on mainstream benchmarks and various TSF tasks. Extensive experiments validate the potential of the GPD paradigm and its assistance in future related research.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Deep Latent Space Particle Filter for Real-Time Data Assimilation with Uncertainty Quantification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02204v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Data Assimilation, observations are fused with simulations to obtain an accurate estimate of the state and parameters for a given physical system. Combining data with a model, however, while accurately estimating uncertainty, is computationally expensive and infeasible to run in real-time for complex systems. Here, we present a novel particle filter methodology, the Deep Latent Space Particle filter or D-LSPF, that uses neural network-based surrogate models to overcome this computational challenge. The D-LSPF enables filtering in the low-dimensional latent space obtained using Wasserstein AEs with modified vision transformer layers for dimensionality reduction and transformers for parameterized latent space time stepping. As we demonstrate on three test cases, including leak localization in multi-phase pipe flow and seabed identification for fully nonlinear water waves, the D-LSPF runs orders of magnitude faster than a high-fidelity particle filter and 3-5 times faster than alternative methods while being up to an order of magnitude more accurate. The D-LSPF thus enables real-time data assimilation with uncertainty quantification for physical systems.</p></details> |  |

We characterize the optimal batch size minimizing the iteration time as a function of the hardness of the target, as characterized by the information exponents. We show that performing gradient updates with large batches $n_b \lesssim d^{\frac{\ell}{2}}$ minimizes the training time without changing the total sample complexity, where $\ell$ is the information exponent of the target to be learned \citep{arous2021online} and $d$ is the input dimension. However, larger batch sizes than $n_b \gg d^{\frac{\ell}{2}}$ are detrimental for improving the time complexity of SGD. We provably overcome this fundamental limitation via a different training protocol, \textit{Correlation loss SGD}, which suppresses the auto-correlation terms in the loss function. We show that one can track the training progress by a system of low-dimensional ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Finally, we validate our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

As a direct result, on input an $n$ vertex $m$ edges graph $G$, we present the \textit{first} $\widetilde{O}(m)$ time and $O(m)$ space algorithms for differentially privately outputting an $n$ vertex $O(m)$ edges synthetic graph that approximates all the cuts and the spectrum of $G$. These are the \emph{first} private algorithms for releasing synthetic graphs that nearly match this task's time and space complexity in the non-private setting while achieving the same (or better) utility as the previous works in the more practical sparse regime. Additionally, our algorithms can be extended to private graph analysis under continual observation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CondTSF: One-line Plugin of Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02131v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation is a newborn technique that generates a small dataset that can be used in training deep neural networks to lower training costs. The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.</p></details> | 23 pages, 13 figures |

A Time-adaptive Approach for Continuous-Time RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01163v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) excels in optimizing policies for discrete-time Markov decision processes (MDP). However, various systems are inherently continuous in time, making discrete-time MDPs an inexact modeling choice. In many applications, such as greenhouse control or medical treatments, each interaction (measurement or switching of action) involves manual intervention and thus is inherently costly. Therefore, we generally prefer a time-adaptive approach with fewer interactions with the system. In this work, we formalize an RL framework, Time-adaptive Control & Sensing (TaCoS), that tackles this challenge by optimizing over policies that besides control predict the duration of its application. Our formulation results in an extended MDP that any standard RL algorithm can solve. We demonstrate that state-of-the-art RL algorithms trained on TaCoS drastically reduce the interaction amount over their discrete-time counterpart while retaining the same or improved performance, and exhibiting robustness over discretization frequency. Finally, we propose OTaCoS, an efficient model-based algorithm for our setting. We show that OTaCoS enjoys sublinear regret for systems with sufficiently smooth dynamics and empirically results in further sample-efficiency gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timer: Generative Pre-trained Transformers Are Large Time Series Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02368v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has contributed remarkably to the advancement of time series analysis. Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task. The outcome of this study is a Time Series Transformer (Timer), which is generative pre-trained by next token prediction and adapted to various downstream tasks with promising capabilities as an LTSM.

The advent of neural networks has initiated a significant shift in tackling these complexities though challenges in accuracy persist, especially for initial value problems. In this paper, we introduce the $\textit{Time-Evolving Natural Gradient (TENG)}$, generalizing time-dependent variational principles and optimization-based time integration, leveraging natural gradient optimization to obtain high accuracy in neural-network-based PDE solutions. Our comprehensive development includes algorithms like TENG-Euler and its high-order variants, such as TENG-Heun, tailored for enhanced precision and efficiency. TENG's effectiveness is further validated through its performance, surpassing current leading methods and achieving $\textit{machine precision}$ in step-by-step optimizations across a spectrum of PDEs, including the heat equation, Allen-Cahn equation, and Burgers' equation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Convolutional Forecasting Network Based on Time Series Feature-Driven](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12038v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data in real-world scenarios contain a substantial amount of nonlinear information, which significantly interferes with the training process of models, leading to decreased prediction performance. Therefore, during the time series forecasting process, extracting the local and global time series patterns and understanding the potential nonlinear features among different time observations are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information at different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture potential nonlinear features among time observations. Building upon this, we propose ACNet, an adaptive convolutional network designed to effectively model the local and global temporal dependencies and the nonlinear features between observations in multivariate time series. Specifically, by extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, we capture both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed nonlinear feature adaptive extraction module captures the nonlinear features among different time observations in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ACNet across twelve real-world datasets. The results indicate that ACNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks with favorable runtime efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Time-Aware Language Representation: Exploring Enhanced Temporal Understanding in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01863v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving field of Natural Language Processing, understanding the temporal context of text is increasingly crucial. This study investigates methods to incorporate temporal information during pre-training, aiming to achieve effective time-aware language representation for improved performance on time-related tasks. In contrast to common pre-trained models like BERT, which rely on synchronic document collections such as BookCorpus and Wikipedia, our research introduces BiTimeBERT 2.0, a novel language model pre-trained on a temporal news article collection. BiTimeBERT 2.0 utilizes this temporal news collection, focusing on three innovative pre-training objectives: Time-Aware Masked Language Modeling (TAMLM), Document Dating (DD), and Time-Sensitive Entity Replacement (TSER). Each objective targets a unique aspect of temporal information. TAMLM is designed to enhance the understanding of temporal contexts and relations, DD integrates document timestamps as chronological markers, and TSER focuses on the temporal dynamics of "Person" entities, recognizing their inherent temporal significance. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that BiTimeBERT 2.0 outperforms models like BERT and other existing pre-trained models, achieving substantial gains across a variety of downstream NLP tasks and applications where time plays a pivotal role.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces ECHO -- a novel optimization process for ML/DL-based encrypted traffic classification. ECHO targets both classification time and memory utilization and incorporates two innovative techniques. The first component, HO (Hyperparameter Optimization of binnings), aims at creating efficient traffic representations. While previous research often uses representations that map packet sizes and packet arrival times to fixed-sized bins, we show that non-uniform binnings are significantly more efficient. These non-uniform binnings are derived by employing a hyperparameter optimization algorithm in the training stage. HO significantly improves accuracy given a required representation size, or, equivalently, achieves comparable accuracy using smaller representations. Then, we introduce EC (Early Classification of traffic), which enables faster classification using a cascade of classifiers adapted for different exit times, where classification is based on the level of confidence. EC reduces the average classification latency by up to 90\%. Remarkably, this method not only maintains classification accuracy but also, in certain cases, improves it. Using three publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that the combined method, Early Classification with Hyperparameter Optimization (ECHO), leads to a significant improvement in classification efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Current explanation methods for MTS mostly focus on time-centric explanations, apt for pinpointing important time periods but less effective in identifying key features. This limitation underscores the pressing need for a feature-centric approach, a vital yet often overlooked perspective that complements time-centric analysis. To bridge this gap, our study introduces a novel feature-centric explanation and evaluation framework for MTS, named CAFO (Channel Attention and Feature Orthgonalization). CAFO employs a convolution-based approach with channel attention mechanisms, incorporating a depth-wise separable channel attention module (DepCA) and a QR decomposition-based loss for promoting feature-wise orthogonality. We demonstrate that this orthogonalization enhances the separability of attention distributions, thereby refining and stabilizing the ranking of feature importance. This improvement in feature-wise ranking enhances our understanding of feature explainability in MTS. Furthermore, we develop metrics to evaluate global and class-specific feature importance. Our framework's efficacy is validated through extensive empirical analyses on two major public benchmarks and real-world datasets, both synthetic and self-collected, specifically designed to highlight class-wise discriminative features. The results confirm CAFO's robustness and informative capacity in assessing feature importance in MTS classification tasks. This study not only advances the understanding of feature-centric explanations in MTS but also sets a foundation for future explorations in feature-centric explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to KDD 2024 Research Track</p></details> |

Zonotope Agreement of Prediction and Planning for Continuous-Time Collision Avoidance with Discrete-Time Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01814v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past few years have seen immense progress on two fronts that are critical to safe, widespread mobile robot deployment: predicting uncertain motion of multiple agents, and planning robot motion under uncertainty. However, the numerical methods required on each front have resulted in a mismatch of representation for prediction and planning. In prediction, numerical tractability is usually achieved by coarsely discretizing time, and by representing multimodal multi-agent interactions as distributions with infinite support. On the other hand, safe planning typically requires very fine time discretization, paired with distributions with compact support, to reduce conservativeness and ensure numerical tractability. The result is, when existing predictors are coupled with planning and control, one may often find unsafe motion plans. This paper proposes ZAPP (Zonotope Agreement of Prediction and Planning) to resolve the representation mismatch. ZAPP unites a prediction-friendly coarse time discretization and a planning-friendly zonotope uncertainty representation; the method also enables differentiating through a zonotope collision check, allowing one to integrate prediction and planning within a gradient-based optimization framework. Numerical examples show how ZAPP can produce safer trajectories compared to baselines in interactive scenes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, submitted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[Memory Capacity Analysis of Time-delay Reservoir Computing Based on Silicon Microring Resonator Nonlinearities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01812v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Silicon microring resonators (MRRs) have shown strong potential in acting as the nonlinear nodes of photonic reservoir computing (RC) schemes. By using nonlinearities within a silicon MRR, such as the ones caused by free-carrier dispersion (FCD) and thermo-optic (TO) effects, it is possible to map the input data of the RC to a higher dimensional space. Furthermore, by adding an external waveguide between the through and add ports of the MRR, it is possible to implement a time-delay RC (TDRC) with enhanced memory. The input from the through port is fed back into the add port of the ring with the delay applied by the external waveguide effectively adding memory. In a TDRC, the nodes are multiplexed in time, and their respective time evolutions are detected at the drop port. The performance of MRR-based TDRC is highly dependent on the amount of nonlinearity in the MRR. The nonlinear effects, in turn, are dependent on the physical properties of the MRR as they determine the lifetime of the effects. Another factor to take into account is the stability of the MRR response, as strong time-domain discontinuities at the drop port are known to emerge from FCD nonlinearities due to self-pulsing (high nonlinear behaviour). However, quantifying the right amount of nonlinearity that RC needs for a certain task in order to achieve optimum performance is challenging. Therefore, further analysis is required to fully understand the nonlinear dynamics of this TDRC setup. Here, we quantify the nonlinear and linear memory capacity of the previously described microring-based TDRC scheme, as a function of the time constants of the generated carriers and the thermal of the TO effects. We analyze the properties of the TDRC dynamics that generate the parameter space, in terms of input signal power and frequency detuning range, over which conventional RC tasks can be satisfactorily performed by the TDRC scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Time-Spectral Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01740v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study concerns the efficiency of time-spectral methods for numerical solution of differential equations. It is found that the time-spectral method GWRM demonstrates insensitivity to stiffness and chaoticity due to the implicit nature of the solution algorithm. Accuracy is thus determined primarily by numerical resolution of the solution shape. Examples of efficient solution of stiff and chaotic problems, where explicit methods fail or are significantly slower, are given. Non-smooth and partially steep solutions, however, remain challenging for convergence and accuracy. Some, earlier suggested, smoothing algorithms are shown to be ineffective in addressing this issue. Our findings underscore the need for further exploration of time-spectral approaches to enhance convergence and accuracy for steep or non-smooth solutions.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Inference of Utilities and Time Preference in Sequential Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15975v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel stochastic control framework to enhance the capabilities of automated investment managers, or robo-advisors, by accurately inferring clients' investment preferences from past activities. Our approach leverages a continuous-time model that incorporates utility functions and a generic discounting scheme of a time-varying rate, tailored to each client's risk tolerance, valuation of daily consumption, and significant life goals. We address the resulting time inconsistency issue through state augmentation and the establishment of the dynamic programming principle and the verification theorem. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions for the identifiability of client investment preferences. To complement our theoretical developments, we propose a learning algorithm based on maximum likelihood estimation within a discrete-time Markov Decision Process framework, augmented with entropy regularization. We prove that the log-likelihood function is locally concave, facilitating the fast convergence of our proposed algorithm. Practical effectiveness and efficiency are showcased through two numerical examples, including Merton's problem and an investment problem with unhedgeable risks. Our proposed framework not only advances financial technology by improving personalized investment advice but also contributes broadly to other fields such as healthcare, economics, and artificial intelligence, where understanding individual preferences is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heracles: A Hybrid SSM-Transformer Model for High-Resolution Image and Time-Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18063v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have revolutionized image modeling tasks with adaptations like DeIT, Swin, SVT, Biformer, STVit, and FDVIT. However, these models often face challenges with inductive bias and high quadratic complexity, making them less efficient for high-resolution images. State space models (SSMs) such as Mamba, V-Mamba, ViM, and SiMBA offer an alternative to handle high resolution images in computer vision tasks. These SSMs encounter two major issues. First, they become unstable when scaled to large network sizes. Second, although they efficiently capture global information in images, they inherently struggle with handling local information. To address these challenges, we introduce Heracles, a novel SSM that integrates a local SSM, a global SSM, and an attention-based token interaction module. Heracles leverages a Hartely kernel-based state space model for global image information, a localized convolutional network for local details, and attention mechanisms in deeper layers for token interactions. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Heracles-C-small achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet dataset with 84.5\% top-1 accuracy. Heracles-C-Large and Heracles-C-Huge further improve accuracy to 85.9\% and 86.4\%, respectively. Additionally, Heracles excels in transfer learning tasks on datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Oxford Flowers, and Stanford Cars, and in instance segmentation on the MSCOCO dataset. Heracles also proves its versatility by achieving state-of-the-art results on seven time-series datasets, showcasing its ability to generalize across domains with spectral data, capturing both local and global information.

Recent diffusion-based methods show impressive performance in 3D robotic manipulation tasks, whereas they suffer from severe runtime inefficiency due to multiple denoising steps, especially with high-dimensional observations. To this end, we propose a real-time robotic manipulation model named ManiCM that imposes the consistency constraint to the diffusion process, so that the model can generate robot actions in only one-step inference. Specifically, we formulate a consistent diffusion process in the robot action space conditioned on the point cloud input, where the original action is required to be directly denoised from any point along the ODE trajectory. To model this process, we design a consistency distillation technique to predict the action sample directly instead of predicting the noise within the vision community for fast convergence in the low-dimensional action manifold. We evaluate ManiCM on 31 robotic manipulation tasks from Adroit and Metaworld, and the results demonstrate that our approach accelerates the state-of-the-art method by 10 times in average inference speed while maintaining competitive average success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://manicm-fast.github.io/</p></details> |

Consequently, recent research efforts have focused on developing pre-trained TS forecasting models. These models, whether built from scratch or adapted from large language models (LLMs), excel in zero/few-shot forecasting tasks. However, they are limited by slow performance, high computational demands, and neglect of cross-channel and exogenous correlations. To address this, we introduce Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a compact model (starting from 1M parameters) with effective transfer learning capabilities, trained exclusively on public TS datasets. TTM, based on the light-weight TSMixer architecture, incorporates innovations like adaptive patching, diverse resolution sampling, and resolution prefix tuning to handle pre-training on varied dataset resolutions with minimal model capacity. Additionally, it employs multi-level modeling to capture channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning. TTM outperforms existing popular benchmarks in zero/few-shot forecasting by (4-40\%), while reducing computational requirements significantly. Moreover, TTMs are lightweight and can be executed even on CPU-only machines, enhancing usability and fostering wider adoption in resource-constrained environments. Model weights for our initial variant (TTM-Q) are available at https://huggingface.co/ibm-granite/granite-timeseries-ttm-v1. Model weights for more sophisticated variants (TTM-B, TTM-E, and TTM-A) will be shared soon.

As software systems evolve, technical debt tends to increase. However, estimating its impact on lead time still requires more empirical and experimental evidence. Objective: We conduct an empirical study investigating whether technical debt impacts lead time in resolving Jira issues. Furthermore, our aim is to measure the extent to which variance in lead time is explainable by the technical debt. Method: We conducted an industrial case study to examine the relationship in six components, each of which was analyzed individually. Technical debt was measured using SonarQube and normalized with the component's size, while lead time to resolve Jira issues was collected directly from Jira. Results: We found a set of mixed results. Technical debt had a moderate positive impact on lead time in two components, while we did not see a meaningful impact on two others. A moderate negative impact was found in the remaining two components. Conclusion: The findings show that technical debt alone can not explain all the variance in lead time, which ranges from 5% up to 41% across components. So, there should be some other variables (e.g., size of the changes made, complexity, number of teams involved, component ownership) impacting lead time, or it might have a residual effect that might manifest later on. Further investigation into those confounding variables is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Euromicro Conference Series on Software Engineering and Advanced Applications (SEAA).

Our method can be used to optimize through any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target (stylized) output and leverages gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency. We demonstrate a surprisingly wide-range of applications for music generation including inpainting, outpainting, and looping as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control - all without ever fine-tuning the underlying model. When we compare our approach against related training, guidance, and optimization-based methods, we find DITTO achieves state-of-the-art performance on nearly all tasks, including outperforming comparable approaches on controllability, audio quality, and computational efficiency, thus opening the door for high-quality, flexible, training-free control of diffusion models.

For large enough models, we empirically find a time asymmetry in their ability to learn natural language: a difference in the average log-perplexity when trying to predict the next token versus when trying to predict the previous one. This difference is at the same time subtle and very consistent across various modalities (language, model size, training time, ...). Theoretically, this is surprising: from an information-theoretic point of view, there should be no such difference. We provide a theoretical framework to explain how such an asymmetry can appear from sparsity and computational complexity considerations, and outline a number of perspectives opened by our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Re-ar...</summary><p>Re-arranged and updated figures.

This rigidity poses challenges in practical applications, as the optimal control frequency is task-dependent. A suboptimal choice can lead to high computational demands and reduced exploration efficiency. Variable Time Step Reinforcement Learning (VTS-RL) addresses these issues by using adaptive frequencies for the control loop, executing actions only when necessary. This approach, rooted in reactive programming principles, reduces computational load and extends the action space by including action durations. However, VTS-RL's implementation is often complicated by the need to tune multiple hyperparameters that govern exploration in the multi-objective action-duration space (i.e., balancing task performance and number of time steps to achieve a goal). To overcome these challenges, we introduce the Multi-Objective Soft Elastic Actor-Critic (MOSEAC) method. This method features an adaptive reward scheme that adjusts hyperparameters based on observed trends in task rewards during training. This scheme reduces the complexity of hyperparameter tuning, requiring a single hyperparameter to guide exploration, thereby simplifying the learning process and lowering deployment costs. We validate the MOSEAC method through simulations in a Newtonian kinematics environment, demonstrating high task and training performance with fewer time steps, ultimately lowering energy consumption. This validation shows that MOSEAC streamlines RL algorithm deployment by automatically tuning the agent control loop frequency using a single parameter. Its principles can be applied to enhance any RL algorithm, making it a versatile solution for various applications.</p></details> |  |

We consider here two abstractions: the extended summary causal graph, which conflates all lagged causal relations but distinguishes between lagged and instantaneous relations, and the summary causal graph which does not give any indication about the lag between causal relations. We show that the total effect is always identifiable in extended summary causal graphs and provide sufficient conditions for identifiability in summary causal graphs. We furthermore provide adjustment sets allowing to estimate the total effect whenever it is identifiable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial-time Approximation Scheme for Equilibriums of Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00747v3)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whether a PTAS (polynomial-time approximation scheme) exists for equilibriums of games has been an open question, which relates to questions in three fields, the practicality of methods in algorithmic game theory, the equation PPAD=FP about the two complexity classes in computational complexity theory, and non-stationarity and curse of multiagency in MARL (multi-agent reinforcement learning). This paper introduces our discovery of the sufficient and necessary conditions for iterations based on dynamic programming and line search to approximate perfect equilibriums of dynamic games, out of which we construct a method proved to be a FPTAS (fully PTAS) for non-singular perfect equilibriums of dynamic games, where for almost any given dynamic game, all its perfect equilibriums are non-singular, indicating that FP$\subseteq$PPAD$\subseteq$Almost-FP. Our discovery consists of cone interior dynamic programming and primal-dual unbiased regret minimization, which fit into existing theories by degeneration in a structure-preserving manner. The former enables a dynamic programming operator to iteratively converge to a perfect equilibrium based on a concept called policy cone. The latter enables an interior-point line search to approximate a Nash equilibrium based on two concepts called primal-dual bias and unbiased central variety, solving a subproblem of the former. Validity of our discovery is cross-corroborated by a combination of theorem proofs, graphs of the three main concepts, and experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 7 figures, code and animation are available at https://github.com/shb20tsinghua/PTAS_Game/tree/main</p></details> |

To better understand this phenomenon, we start by studying a toy linear forecasting problem for which we show that transformers are incapable of converging to their true solution despite their high expressive power. We further identify the attention of transformers as being responsible for this low generalization capacity. Building upon this insight, we propose a shallow lightweight transformer model that successfully escapes bad local minima when optimized with sharpness-aware optimization. We empirically demonstrate that this result extends to all commonly used real-world multivariate time series datasets. In particular, SAMformer surpasses current state-of-the-art methods and is on par with the biggest foundation model MOIRAI while having significantly fewer parameters.

At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model's complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique, the SparseTSF model uses fewer than *1k* parameters to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data. The code is publicly available at this repository: https://github.com/lss-1138/SparseTSF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spurious Feature Eraser: Stabilizing Test-Time Adaptation for Vision-Language Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00376v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models have exhibited remarkable success across a multitude of downstream tasks due to their scalability on extensive image-text paired data. However, these models also display significant limitations when applied to downstream tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, as a result of ``decision shortcuts'' that hinder their generalization capabilities. In this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features, encompassing both \textit{desired invariant causal features} and \textit{undesired decision shortcuts}. Moreover, the underperformance of CLIP on downstream tasks originates from its inability to effectively utilize pre-trained features in accordance with specific task requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective method, Spurious Feature Eraser (SEraser), to alleviate the decision shortcuts by erasing the spurious features. Specifically, we introduce a test-time prompt tuning paradigm that optimizes a learnable prompt, thereby compelling the model to exploit invariant features while disregarding decision shortcuts during the inference phase. The proposed method effectively alleviates excessive dependence on potentially misleading spurious information. We conduct comparative analysis of the proposed method against various approaches which validates the significant superiority.</p></details> |  |

A fundamental application is multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF), which aims to predict future time series values based on historical observations. Existing MTSF methods suffer from limited parameterization and small-scale training data. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have been introduced in time series, which achieve promising forecasting performance but incur heavy computational costs. To solve these challenges, we propose TimeCMA, an LLM-empowered framework for time series forecasting with cross-modality alignment. We design a dual-modality encoding module with two branches, where the time series encoding branch extracts relatively low-quality yet pure embeddings of time series through an inverted Transformer. In addition, the LLM-empowered encoding branch wraps the same time series as prompts to obtain high-quality yet entangled prompt embeddings via a Pre-trained LLM. Then, we design a cross-modality alignment module to retrieve high-quality and pure time series embeddings from the prompt embeddings. Moreover, we develop a time series forecasting module to decode the aligned embeddings while capturing dependencies among multiple variables for forecasting. Notably, we tailor the prompt to encode sufficient temporal information into a last token and design the last token embedding storage to reduce computational costs. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Technical Report: Time-Bounded Resilience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05585v3)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most research on formal system design has focused on optimizing various measures of efficiency. However, insufficient attention has been given to the design of systems optimizing resilience, the ability of systems to adapt to unexpected changes or adversarial disruptions. In our prior work, we formalized the intuitive notion of resilience as a property of cyber-physical systems by using a multiset rewriting language with explicit time. In the present paper, we study the computational complexity of a formalization of time-bounded resilience problems for the class of $\eta$-simple progressing planning scenarios, where, intuitively, it is simple to check that a system configuration is critical, and only a finite number of actions can be carried out in a bounded time period. We show that, in the time-bounded model with $n$ (potentially adversarially chosen) updates, the corresponding time-bounded resilience problem for this class of systems is complete for the $\Sigma^P_{2n+1}$ class of the polynomial hierarchy, PH. To support the formal models and complexity results, we perform automated experiments for time-bounded verification using the rewriting logic tool Maude.</p></details> |  |

The time derivative term is discretized by using the method of lines based on the implicit BDF1 scheme, while the inviscid and viscous terms are approximated by conventional 2nd-order 3-point central discretizations of the 1st- and 2nd-order derivatives in each spatial direction. The global system of nonlinear discrete equations in the space-time domain is solved by the Newton method for all time levels simultaneously. For the BDF1 discretization, this all-at-once system at each Newton iteration is block bidiagonal, which can be inverted directly in a blockwise manner, thus leading to a set of fully decoupled equations associated with each time level. This allows for an efficient parallel-in-time implementation of the implicit BDF1 discretization for nonlinear differential equations. The proposed parallel-in-time method preserves a quadratic rate of convergence of the Newton method of the sequential BDF1 scheme, so that the computational cost of solving each block matrix in parallel is nearly identical to that of the sequential counterpart at each time step. Numerical results show that the new parallel-in-time BDF1 scheme provides the speedup of up to 28 on 32 computing cores for the 2-D nonlinear partial differential equations with both smooth and discontinuous solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

However, ensuring their reliability and user acceptance requires effective strategies for rebalancing bikes. This study introduces a novel approach to address the real-time rebalancing problem with a fleet of vehicles. It employs a dual policy reinforcement learning algorithm that decouples inventory and routing decisions, enhancing realism and efficiency compared to previous methods where both decisions were made simultaneously. We first formulate the inventory and routing subproblems as a multi-agent Markov Decision Process within a continuous time framework. Subsequently, we propose a DQN-based dual policy framework to jointly estimate the value functions, minimizing the lost demand. To facilitate learning, a comprehensive simulator is applied to operate under a first-arrive-first-serve rule, which enables the computation of immediate rewards across diverse demand scenarios. We conduct extensive experiments on various datasets generated from historical real-world data, affected by both temporal and weather factors. Our proposed algorithm demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous baseline methods. It offers valuable practical insights for operators and further explores the incorporation of reinforcement learning into real-world dynamic programming problems, paving the way for more intelligent and robust urban mobility solutions.</p></details> |  |

Current defense methods often reduce generalization performance, are attack-specific, and impose significant training overhead. To address this, we introduce a set of universal data purification methods using a stochastic transform, $\Psi(x)$, realized via iterative Langevin dynamics of Energy-Based Models (EBMs), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), or both. These approaches purify poisoned data with minimal impact on classifier generalization. Our specially trained EBMs and DDPMs provide state-of-the-art defense against various attacks (including Narcissus, Bullseye Polytope, Gradient Matching) on CIFAR-10, Tiny-ImageNet, and CINIC-10, without needing attack or classifier-specific information. We discuss performance trade-offs and show that our methods remain highly effective even with poisoned or distributionally shifted generative model training data.</p></details> |  |

Causal models are forced to output one interpretation and continue, whereas models that can revise may edit their previous output as the ambiguity is resolved. In this work, we look at how restart-incremental Transformers build and update internal states, in an effort to shed light on what processes cause revisions not viable in autoregressive models. We propose an interpretable way to analyse the incremental states, showing that their sequential structure encodes information on the garden path effect and its resolution. Our method brings insights on various bidirectional encoders for contextualised meaning representation and dependency parsing, contributing to show their advantage over causal models when it comes to revisions.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |
| **[Classical Verification of Quantum Computations in Linear Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.13997v5)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the quantum computation verification problem, a quantum server wants to convince a client that the output of evaluating a quantum circuit $C$ is some result that it claims. This problem is considered very important both theoretically and practically in quantum computation [arXiv:1709.06984], [arXiv:1704.04487], [arXiv:1209.0449]. The client is considered to be limited in computational power, and one desirable property is that the client can be completely classical, which leads to the classical verification of quantum computation (CVQC) problem. In terms of the total time complexity, the fastest single-server CVQC protocol so far has complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|^3)$ where $|C|$ is the size of the circuit to be verified and $\kappa$ is the security parameter, given by Mahadev [arXiv:1804.01082]. In this work, by developing new techniques, we give a new CVQC protocol with complexity $O(poly(\kappa)|C|)$, which is significantly faster than existing protocols. Our protocol is secure in the quantum random oracle model [arXiv:1008.0931] assuming the existence of noisy trapdoor claw-free functions [arXiv:1804.00640], which are both extensively used assumptions in quantum cryptography. Along the way, we also give a new classical channel remote state preparation protocol for states in $\{|+_\theta\rangle=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(|0\rangle+e^{i\theta\pi/4}|1\rangle):\theta\in \{0,1\cdots 7\}\}$, another basic primitive in quantum cryptography. Our protocol allows for parallel verifiable preparation of $L$ independently random states in this form (up to a constant overall error and a possibly unbounded server-side simulator), and runs in only $O(poly(\kappa)L)$ time and constant rounds; for comparison, existing works (even for possibly simpler state families) all require very large or unestimated time and round complexities [arXiv:1904.06320][arXiv:1904.06303][arXiv:2201.13445][arXiv:2201.13430].</p></details> | <details><summary>122 p...</summary><p>122 pages, 3 figures; In FOCS 2022; Small changes</p></details> |
| **[A Digital Twin Framework for Reinforcement Learning with Real-Time Self-Improvement via Human Assistive Teleoperation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00732v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) or Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is a powerful approach to solving Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when the model of the environment is not known a priori. However, RL models are still faced with challenges such as handling covariate shifts and ensuring the quality of human demonstration. To address these challenges and further advance DRL models, our work develops a human-in-the-loop DRL framework via digital twin that leverages human intelligence after deployment to retrain the DRL model in real time. First, we develop a pre-trained model fully based on learning through trial and error in the simulated environment allowing scalability and automation while eliminating variability and biases that can come from subjective human guidance. Second, instead of deploying the trained model directly on the UGV, we create a digital twin which controls the physical UGV from the virtual environment. Third, to allow continuous learning without catastrophic forgetting, we introduce the ability of the model to self-improve with the help of small human guidance at the start of the retraining. We test the performance of our proposed model in both simulation and real-world environments with both static and dynamic obstacles. The results indicate that our proposed approach not only outperforms the baseline models in terms of reward accumulation but also demonstrates superior training efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the modelling and prediction of high-dimensional functional time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00700v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a two-step procedure to model and predict high-dimensional functional time series, where the number of function-valued time series $p$ is large in relation to the length of time series $n$. Our first step performs an eigenanalysis of a positive definite matrix, which leads to a one-to-one linear transformation for the original high-dimensional functional time series, and the transformed curve series can be segmented into several groups such that any two subseries from any two different groups are uncorrelated both contemporaneously and serially. Consequently in our second step those groups are handled separately without the information loss on the overall linear dynamic structure. The second step is devoted to establishing a finite-dimensional dynamical structure for all the transformed functional time series within each group. Furthermore the finite-dimensional structure is represented by that of a vector time series. Modelling and forecasting for the original high-dimensional functional time series are realized via those for the vector time series in all the groups. We investigate the theoretical properties of our proposed methods, and illustrate the finite-sample performance through both extensive simulation and two real datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

To determine $\Gamma(G)$ is NP-complete for various classes of graphs. Also there exists a constant $c>0$ such that the Grundy number is hard to approximate within the ratio $c$. We first obtain an $\mathcal{O}(VE)$ algorithm to determine the Grundy number of block graphs i.e. graphs in which every biconnected component is complete subgraph. We prove that the Grundy number of a general graph $G$ with cut-vertices is upper bounded by the Grundy number of a block graph corresponding to $G$. This provides a reasonable upper bound for the Grundy number of graphs with cut-vertices. Next, define $\Delta_2(G)={\max}_{u\in G}~ {\max}_{v\in N(u):d(v)\leq d(u)} d(v)$. We obtain an $\mathcal{O}(VE)$ algorithm to determine $\Gamma(G)$ for graphs $G$ whose girth $g$ is at least $2\Delta_2(G)+1$. This algorithm provides a polynomial time approximation algorithm within ratio $\min \{1, (g+1)/(2\Delta_2(G)+2)\}$ for $\Gamma(G)$ of general graphs $G$ with girth $g$.</p></details> | 16 pages, 2 figures |

Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.</p></details> |  |

Using the non-parametric flexibility of Gaussian processes, the recently proposed INTEL algorithm provides a product of experts approach to online prediction of time series under possible regime switching, including the special case of outliers. This is achieved by adaptively combining several candidate models, each reporting their predictive distribution at time $t$. However, the INTEL algorithm uses a finite context window approximation to the predictive distribution, the computation of which scales cubically with the maximum lag, or otherwise scales quartically with exact predictive distributions. We introduce LINTEL, which uses the exact filtering distribution at time $t$ with constant-time updates, making the time complexity of the streaming algorithm optimal. We additionally note that the weighting mechanism of INTEL is better suited to a mixture of experts approach, and propose a fusion policy based on arithmetic averaging for LINTEL. We show experimentally that our proposed approach is over five times faster than INTEL under reasonable settings with better quality predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures.

Existing learning techniques often rely on labels or clean versions of signals for detecting the periodicity, and those employing self-supervised learning methods are required to apply proper augmentations, which is already challenging for time series and can result in collapse -- all representations collapse to a single point due to strong augmentations. In this work, we propose a novel method to detect the periodicity in time series without the need for any labels or requiring tailored positive or negative data generation mechanisms with specific augmentations. We mitigate the collapse issue by ensuring the learned representations retain information from the original samples without imposing any random variance constraints on the batch. Our experiments in three time series tasks against state-of-the-art learning methods show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms prior works, achieving performance improvements of more than 45--50\%, showing its effectiveness.

This paper introduces a unique approach to counterfactual regression over time, emphasizing long-term predictions. Distinguishing itself from existing models like Causal Transformer, our approach highlights the efficacy of employing RNNs for long-term forecasting, complemented by Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) and Information Maximization (InfoMax). Emphasizing efficiency, we avoid the need for computationally expensive transformers. Leveraging CPC, our method captures long-term dependencies in the presence of time-varying confounders. Notably, recent models have disregarded the importance of invertible representation, compromising identification assumptions. To remedy this, we employ the InfoMax principle, maximizing a lower bound of mutual information between sequence data and its representation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art counterfactual estimation results using both synthetic and real-world data, marking the pioneering incorporation of Contrastive Predictive Encoding in causal inference.</p></details> |  |

We leverage large scale Vision Language Models like CLIP to enable real time adaptation on a per-image basis without access to source data or ground truth labels. Since the deployed model can also encounter unseen classes in an open world, we first employ a simple and effective Out of Distribution (OOD) detection module to distinguish between weak and strong OOD samples. We propose a novel contrastive learning based objective to enhance the discriminability between weak and strong OOD samples by utilizing small, dynamically updated feature banks. Finally, we also employ a classification objective for adapting the model using the reliable weak OOD samples. The proposed framework ROSITA combines these components, enabling continuous online adaptation of Vision Language Models on a single image basis. Extensive experimentation on diverse domain adaptation benchmarks validates the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

However, current systems face challenges with the separation of state modulation and acquisition, leading to undesired time delays that impact real-time performance. To overcome this issue, we introduce a dual-function circuit that concurrently modulates and acquires memristor state information. This is achieved through two key features: 1) a feedback operational amplifier (op-amp) based circuit that ensures precise voltage application on the memristor while converting the passing current into a voltage signal; 2) a division calculation circuit that acquires state information from the modulation voltage and the converted voltage, improving stability by leveraging the intrinsic threshold characteristics of memristors. This circuit has been evaluated in a memristor-based nociceptor and a memristor crossbar, demonstrating exceptional performance. For instance, it achieves mean absolute acquisition errors below 1 {\Omega} during the modulation process in the nociceptor application. These results demonstrate that the proposed circuit can operate at different scales, holding the potential to enhance a wide range of neuromorphic applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Local Discovery by Partitioning: Polynomial-Time Causal Discovery Around Exposure-Outcome Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17816v3)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal discovery is crucial for causal inference in observational studies, as it can enable the identification of valid adjustment sets (VAS) for unbiased effect estimation. However, global causal discovery is notoriously hard in the nonparametric setting, with exponential time and sample complexity in the worst case. To address this, we propose local discovery by partitioning (LDP): a local causal discovery method that is tailored for downstream inference tasks without requiring parametric and pretreatment assumptions. LDP is a constraint-based procedure that returns a VAS for an exposure-outcome pair under latent confounding, given sufficient conditions. The total number of independence tests performed is worst-case quadratic with respect to the cardinality of the variable set. Asymptotic theoretical guarantees are numerically validated on synthetic graphs. Adjustment sets from LDP yield less biased and more precise average treatment effect estimates than baseline discovery algorithms, with LDP outperforming on confounder recall, runtime, and test count for VAS discovery.

Although large language models (LLMs) have recently made significant strides, the development of artificial general intelligence (AGI) equipped with time series analysis capabilities remains in its nascent phase. Most existing time series models heavily rely on domain knowledge and extensive model tuning, predominantly focusing on prediction tasks. In this paper, we argue that current LLMs have the potential to revolutionize time series analysis, thereby promoting efficient decision-making and advancing towards a more universal form of time series analytical intelligence. Such advancement could unlock a wide range of possibilities, including time series modality switching and question answering. We encourage researchers and practitioners to recognize the potential of LLMs in advancing time series analysis and emphasize the need for trust in these related efforts. Furthermore, we detail the seamless integration of time series analysis with existing LLM technologies and outline promising avenues for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2008.07669, arXiv:nlin/0307015 by other authors</p></details> |

However, they continued to rely on the conventional econometric approach for model training that optimizes the deep learning models on individual assets. This study highlights the importance of global training, where the deep learning model is optimized across a wide spectrum of stocks. Focusing on stock volatility forecasting as an exemplar, we show that global training is not only beneficial but also necessary for deep learning-based financial time series forecasting. We further demonstrate that, given a sufficient amount of training data, a globally trained deep learning model is capable of delivering accurate zero-shot forecasts for any stocks.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Enhancing Temporal Consistency in Video Editing by Reconstructing Videos with 3D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02541v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in zero-shot video diffusion models have shown promise for text-driven video editing, but challenges remain in achieving high temporal consistency. To address this, we introduce Video-3DGS, a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based video refiner designed to enhance temporal consistency in zero-shot video editors. Our approach utilizes a two-stage 3D Gaussian optimizing process tailored for editing dynamic monocular videos. In the first stage, Video-3DGS employs an improved version of COLMAP, referred to as MC-COLMAP, which processes original videos using a Masked and Clipped approach. For each video clip, MC-COLMAP generates the point clouds for dynamic foreground objects and complex backgrounds. These point clouds are utilized to initialize two sets of 3D Gaussians (Frg-3DGS and Bkg-3DGS) aiming to represent foreground and background views. Both foreground and background views are then merged with a 2D learnable parameter map to reconstruct full views. In the second stage, we leverage the reconstruction ability developed in the first stage to impose the temporal constraints on the video diffusion model. To demonstrate the efficacy of Video-3DGS on both stages, we conduct extensive experiments across two related tasks: Video Reconstruction and Video Editing. Video-3DGS trained with 3k iterations significantly improves video reconstruction quality (+3 PSNR, +7 PSNR increase) and training efficiency (x1.9, x4.5 times faster) over NeRF-based and 3DGS-based state-of-art methods on DAVIS dataset, respectively. Moreover, it enhances video editing by ensuring temporal consistency across 58 dynamic monocular videos.</p></details> |  |

We propose the Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (TKAT), a novel attention-based architecture designed to address this task using Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). Inspired by the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), TKAT emerges as a powerful encoder-decoder model tailored to handle tasks in which the observed part of the features is more important than the a priori known part. This new architecture combined the theoretical foundation of the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation with the power of transformers. TKAT aims to simplify the complex dependencies inherent in time series, making them more "interpretable". The use of transformer architecture in this framework allows us to capture long-range dependencies through self-attention mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark towards Temporal, Long Context Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02472v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The digital landscape is rapidly evolving with an ever-increasing volume of online news, emphasizing the need for swift and precise analysis of complex events. We refer to the complex events composed of many news articles over an extended period as Temporal Complex Event (TCE). This paper proposes a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically extract and analyze the event chain within TCE, characterized by their key points and timestamps. We establish a benchmark, named TCELongBench, to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive text. This benchmark encompasses three distinct tasks - reading comprehension, temporal sequencing, and future event forecasting. In the experiment, we leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method and LLMs with long context window to deal with lengthy news articles of TCE. Our findings indicate that models with suitable retrievers exhibit comparable performance with those utilizing long context window.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |

These works have collectively revealed that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is robust to structured perturbations such as quantization, sparsification, and delays. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the surge of interest in multi-agent reinforcement learning, almost nothing is known about the analogous question: Are common reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms also robust to similar perturbations? We investigate this question by studying a variant of the classical temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm with a perturbed update direction, where a general compression operator is used to model the perturbation. Our work makes three important technical contributions. First, we prove that compressed TD algorithms, coupled with an error-feedback mechanism used widely in optimization, exhibit the same non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees as their SGD counterparts. Second, we show that our analysis framework extends seamlessly to nonlinear stochastic approximation schemes that subsume Q-learning. Third, we prove that for multi-agent TD learning, one can achieve linear convergence speedups with respect to the number of agents while communicating just $\tilde{O}(1)$ bits per iteration. Notably, these are the first finite-time results in RL that account for general compression operators and error-feedback in tandem with linear function approximation and Markovian sampling. Our proofs hinge on the construction of novel Lyapunov functions that capture the dynamics of a memory variable introduced by error-feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Transactions on Machine Learning Research</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Graph Rewiring with Expander Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02362v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolving relations in real-world networks are often modelled by temporal graphs. Graph rewiring techniques have been utilised on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to improve expressiveness and increase model performance. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs. TGR enables communication between temporally distant nodes in a continuous time dynamic graph by utilising expander graph propagation to construct a message passing highway for message passing between distant nodes. Expander graphs are suitable candidates for rewiring as they help overcome the oversquashing problem often observed in GNNs. On the public tgbl-wiki benchmark, we show that TGR improves the performance of a widely used TGN model by a significant margin. Our code repository is accessible at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/TGR-254C.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[On the Recoverability of Causal Relations from Temporally Aggregated I.I.D. Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02191v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the effect of temporal aggregation on instantaneous (non-temporal) causal discovery in general setting. This is motivated by the observation that the true causal time lag is often considerably shorter than the observational interval. This discrepancy leads to high aggregation, causing time-delay causality to vanish and instantaneous dependence to manifest. Although we expect such instantaneous dependence has consistency with the true causal relation in certain sense to make the discovery results meaningful, it remains unclear what type of consistency we need and when will such consistency be satisfied. We proposed functional consistency and conditional independence consistency in formal way correspond functional causal model-based methods and conditional independence-based methods respectively and provide the conditions under which these consistencies will hold. We show theoretically and experimentally that causal discovery results may be seriously distorted by aggregation especially in complete nonlinear case and we also find causal relationship still recoverable from aggregated data if we have partial linearity or appropriate prior. Our findings suggest community should take a cautious and meticulous approach when interpreting causal discovery results from such data and show why and when aggregation will distort the performance of causal discovery methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporally Consistent Video Depth from Video Diffusion Priors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01493v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenge of video depth estimation, which expects not only per-frame accuracy but, more importantly, cross-frame consistency. Instead of directly developing a depth estimator from scratch, we reformulate the prediction task into a conditional generation problem. This allows us to leverage the prior knowledge embedded in existing video generation models, thereby reducing learning difficulty and enhancing generalizability. Concretely, we study how to tame the public Stable Video Diffusion (SVD) to predict reliable depth from input videos using a mixture of image depth and video depth datasets. We empirically confirm that a procedural training strategy -- first optimizing the spatial layers of SVD and then optimizing the temporal layers while keeping the spatial layers frozen -- yields the best results in terms of both spatial accuracy and temporal consistency. We further examine the sliding window strategy for inference on arbitrarily long videos. Our observations indicate a trade-off between efficiency and performance, with a one-frame overlap already producing favorable results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our approach, termed ChronoDepth, over existing alternatives, particularly in terms of the temporal consistency of the estimated depth. Additionally, we highlight the benefits of more consistent video depth in two practical applications: depth-conditioned video generation and novel view synthesis.

| **[SVASTIN: Sparse Video Adversarial Attack via Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01894v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust and imperceptible adversarial video attack is challenging due to the spatial and temporal characteristics of videos. The existing video adversarial attack methods mainly take a gradient-based approach and generate adversarial videos with noticeable perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Adversarial Video Attack via Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Networks (SVASTIN) to generate adversarial videos through spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging. It consists of a Guided Target Video Learning (GTVL) module to balance the perturbation budget and optimization speed and a Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Network (STIN) module to perform spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging between a source video and the target feature tensor learned by GTVL module. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our proposed SVASTIN can generate adversarial examples with higher imperceptibility than the state-of-the-art methods with the higher fooling rate.

| **[Towards Effective Time-Aware Language Representation: Exploring Enhanced Temporal Understanding in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01863v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the evolving field of Natural Language Processing, understanding the temporal context of text is increasingly crucial. This study investigates methods to incorporate temporal information during pre-training, aiming to achieve effective time-aware language representation for improved performance on time-related tasks. In contrast to common pre-trained models like BERT, which rely on synchronic document collections such as BookCorpus and Wikipedia, our research introduces BiTimeBERT 2.0, a novel language model pre-trained on a temporal news article collection. BiTimeBERT 2.0 utilizes this temporal news collection, focusing on three innovative pre-training objectives: Time-Aware Masked Language Modeling (TAMLM), Document Dating (DD), and Time-Sensitive Entity Replacement (TSER). Each objective targets a unique aspect of temporal information. TAMLM is designed to enhance the understanding of temporal contexts and relations, DD integrates document timestamps as chronological markers, and TSER focuses on the temporal dynamics of "Person" entities, recognizing their inherent temporal significance. The experimental results consistently demonstrate that BiTimeBERT 2.0 outperforms models like BERT and other existing pre-trained models, achieving substantial gains across a variety of downstream NLP tasks and applications where time plays a pivotal role.</p></details> |  |

The relaxation preferences are represented as a Weighted Finite-state Edit System and are used to compute a relaxed specification automaton that captures all allowable relaxations of the mission specification and their costs. For synthesis, we introduce a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) formulation that combines the motion of the team of robots with the relaxed specification automaton. Our approach combines automata-based and MILP-based methods and leverages the strengths of both approaches while avoiding their shortcomings. Specifically, the relaxed specification automaton explicitly accounts for the progress towards satisfaction, and the MILP-based optimization approach avoids the state-space explosion associated with explicit product-automata construction, thereby efficiently solving the problem. The case studies highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

To tackle unknown and potentially arbitrary temporal distribution shift, we develop an adaptive rolling window approach to estimate the generalization error of a given model. This strategy also facilitates the comparison between any two candidate models by estimating the difference of their generalization errors. We further integrate pairwise comparisons into a single-elimination tournament, achieving near-optimal model selection from a collection of candidates.

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Little work has studied questions whose temporal context is relative to the present time (e.g. "Who was the previous US president?"). We refer to this problem as Present-Anchored Temporal QA (PATQA). PATQA poses unique challenges: (1) large language models (LLMs) may have outdated knowledge, (2) complex temporal relationships (e.g. 'before', 'previous') are hard to reason, (3) multi-hop reasoning may be required, and (4) the gold answers of benchmarks must be continuously updated. To address these challenges, we introduce the PAT-Questions benchmark, which includes single and multi-hop temporal questions. The answers in PAT-Questions can be automatically refreshed by re-running SPARQL queries on a knowledge graph, if available. We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs and a SOTA temporal reasoning model (TEMPREASON-T5) on PAT-Questions through direct prompting and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The results highlight the limitations of existing solutions in PATQA and motivate the need for new methods to improve PATQA reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL '24</p></details> |

For example, in landscape genetics, the aim is to infer spatial mechanisms that govern gene flow in populations. Existing statistical approaches in landscape genetics do not account for temporal dependence in the data and may be computationally prohibitive. We infer mechanisms with a Bayesian hierarchical dyadic model that scales well with large data sets and that accounts for spatial and temporal dependence. We construct a fully-connected network comprising spatio-temporal data for the dyadic model and use normalized composite likelihoods to account for the dependence structure in space and time. We develop a dyadic model to account for physical mechanisms commonly found in physical-statistical models and apply our methods to ancient human DNA data to infer the mechanisms that affected human movement in Bronze Age Europe.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 7 figures, 3 appendices, code on GitHub</p></details> |

The approach automatically combines goal-conditioned policies with temporal contrastive learning to discover meaningful sub-goals. The approach involves pre-training a goal-conditioned agent, finetuning it on the target domain, and using contrastive learning to construct a planning graph that guides the agent via sub-goals. Experiments on multi-agent coordination Overcooked tasks demonstrate improved sample efficiency, the ability to solve sparse-reward and long-horizon problems, and enhanced interpretability compared to baselines. The results highlight the effectiveness of integrating goal-conditioned policies with unsupervised temporal abstraction learning for complex multi-agent transfer learning.

Many recent studies have concentrated on meticulously reconciling various advantages, leading to designed models that are neither simple nor practical. To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic study on existing shortcomings faced by off-the-shelf models, including lack of local fidelity, poor prediction performance over long time-steps,low scalability, and inefficiency. To systematically address the aforementioned problems, we propose an EarthFarseer, a concise framework that combines parallel local convolutions and global Fourier-based transformer architectures, enabling dynamically capture the local-global spatial interactions and dependencies. EarthFarseer also incorporates a multi-scale fully convolutional and Fourier architectures to efficiently and effectively capture the temporal evolution. Our proposal demonstrates strong adaptability across various tasks and datasets, with fast convergence and better local fidelity in long time-steps predictions. Extensive experiments and visualizations over eight human society physical and natural physical datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of EarthFarseer.

Consequently, methods for predicting and preventing traffic accidents have been researched for many years. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, various studies have applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to traffic accident prediction. Modern traffic conditions change rapidly by the minute, and these changes vary significantly across different roads. In other words, the risk of traffic accidents changes minute by minute in various patterns for each road. Therefore, it is desirable to predict traffic accident risk at the Minute-Level and Road-Level. However, because roads have close and complex relationships with adjacent roads, research on predicting traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level is challenging. Thus, it is essential to build a model that can reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of roads for traffic accident prediction. Consequently, recent attempts have been made to use Graph Convolutional Networks to capture the spatial characteristics of roads and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture their temporal characteristics for predicting traffic accident risk. This paper proposes the Sequential based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (SST-GCN), which combines GCN and LSTM, to predict traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level using a road dataset constructed in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Experiments have demonstrated that SST-GCN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in Minute-Level predictions.</p></details> |  |

In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; Code will be made available at https://github.com/EdisonLeeeee/GraphSSM</p></details> |

This paper comprehensively addresses the CLCTS task, including dataset creation, modeling, and evaluation. We (1) build the first CLCTS corpus with 328 instances for hDe-En (extended version with 455 instances) and 289 for hEn-De (extended version with 501 instances), leveraging historical fiction texts and Wikipedia summaries in English and German; (2) examine the effectiveness of popular transformer end-to-end models with different intermediate finetuning tasks; (3) explore the potential of GPT-3.5 as a summarizer; (4) report evaluations from humans, GPT-4, and several recent automatic evaluation metrics. Our results indicate that intermediate task finetuned end-to-end models generate bad to moderate quality summaries while GPT-3.5, as a zero-shot summarizer, provides moderate to good quality outputs. GPT-3.5 also seems very adept at normalizing historical text. To assess data contamination in GPT-3.5, we design an adversarial attack scheme in which we find that GPT-3.5 performs slightly worse for unseen source documents compared to seen documents. Moreover, it sometimes hallucinates when the source sentences are inverted against its prior knowledge with a summarization accuracy of 0.67 for plot omission, 0.71 for entity swap, and 0.53 for plot negation. Overall, our regression results of model performances suggest that longer, older, and more complex source texts (all of which are more characteristic for historical language variants) are harder to summarize for all models, indicating the difficulty of the CLCTS task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compu...</summary><p>Computational Linguistics.

Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction. In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text. Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts. In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. To this end, we introduce TSDRE, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset. Our experiments show that TSDRE achieves state-of-the-art results on both HyperRED-Temporal and ComplexTRED datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL2024 main conference</p></details> |

Recently, the recurrent neural network (RNN)-based TPPs have shown practical advantages over traditional parametric TPP models. However, in the current literature, it remains nascent in understanding neural TPPs from theoretical viewpoints. In this paper, we establish the excess risk bounds of RNN-TPPs under many well-known TPP settings. We especially show that an RNN-TPP with no more than four layers can achieve vanishing generalization errors. Our technical contributions include the characterization of the complexity of the multi-layer RNN class, the construction of $\tanh$ neural networks for approximating dynamic event intensity functions, and the truncation technique for alleviating the issue of unbounded event sequences. Our results bridge the gap between TPP's application and neural network theory.</p></details> |  |

| **[Large Language Models Can Learn Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06853v4)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities, they are not without their flaws and inaccuracies. Recent studies have introduced various methods to mitigate these limitations. Temporal reasoning (TR), in particular, presents a significant challenge for LLMs due to its reliance on diverse temporal concepts and intricate temporal logic. In this paper, we propose TG-LLM, a novel framework towards language-based TR. Instead of reasoning over the original context, we adopt a latent representation, temporal graph (TG) that enhances the learning of TR. A synthetic dataset (TGQA), which is fully controllable and requires minimal supervision, is constructed for fine-tuning LLMs on this text-to-TG translation task. We confirmed in experiments that the capability of TG translation learned on our dataset can be transferred to other TR tasks and benchmarks. On top of that, we teach LLM to perform deliberate reasoning over the TGs via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) bootstrapping and graph data augmentation. We observed that those strategies, which maintain a balance between usefulness and diversity, bring more reliable CoTs and final results than the vanilla CoT distillation.</p></details> | ACL24 (main) |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Encoding of Brain Dynamics with Surface Masked Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05474v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of robust and generalisable models for encoding the spatio-temporal dynamics of human brain activity is crucial for advancing neuroscientific discoveries. However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications for MIDL 2024; 20 figures; 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00405v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the integrated-fire-leak mechanism found in biological neurons, offering a compelling combination of biological realism and energy efficiency. In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Historical Butterfly Counting in Large Temporal Bipartite Networks via Graph Structure-aware Index](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00344v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bipartite graphs are ubiquitous in many domains, e.g., e-commerce platforms, social networks, and academia, by modeling interactions between distinct entity sets. Within these graphs, the butterfly motif, a complete 2*2 biclique, represents the simplest yet significant subgraph structure, crucial for analyzing complex network patterns. Counting the butterflies offers significant benefits across various applications, including community analysis and recommender systems. Additionally, the temporal dimension of bipartite graphs, where edges activate within specific time frames, introduces the concept of historical butterfly counting, i.e., counting butterflies within a given time interval. This temporal analysis sheds light on the dynamics and evolution of network interactions, offering new insights into their mechanisms. Despite its importance, no existing algorithm can efficiently solve the historical butterfly counting task. To address this, we design two novel indices whose memory footprints are dependent on #butterflies and #wedges, respectively. Combining these indices, we propose a graph structure-aware indexing approach that significantly reduces memory usage while preserving exceptional query speed. We theoretically prove that our approach is particularly advantageous on power-law graphs, a common characteristic of real-world bipartite graphs, by surpassing traditional complexity barriers for general graphs. Extensive experiments reveal that our query algorithms outperform existing methods by up to five magnitudes, effectively balancing speed with manageable memory requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSCA: A Digital Subtraction Angiography Sequence Dataset and Spatio-Temporal Model for Cerebral Artery Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00341v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cerebrovascular diseases (CVDs) remain a leading cause of global disability and mortality. Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the golden standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the first publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with Spike Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09486v4)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing a sequence of sharp images from the blurry input is crucial for enhancing our insights into the captured scene and poses a significant challenge due to the limited temporal features embedded in the image. Spike cameras, sampling at rates up to 40,000 Hz, have proven effective in capturing motion features and beneficial for solving this ill-posed problem. Nonetheless, existing methods fall into the supervised learning paradigm, which suffers from notable performance degradation when applied to real-world scenarios that diverge from the synthetic training data domain. Moreover, the quality of reconstructed images is capped by the generated images based on motion analysis interpolation, which inherently differs from the actual scene, affecting the generalization ability of these methods in real high-speed scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first self-supervised framework for the task of spike-guided motion deblurring. Our approach begins with the formulation of a spike-guided deblurring model that explores the theoretical relationships among spike streams, blurry images, and their corresponding sharp sequences. We subsequently develop a self-supervised cascaded framework to alleviate the issues of spike noise and spatial-resolution mismatching encountered in the deblurring model. With knowledge distillation and re-blurring loss, we further design a lightweight deblur network to generate high-quality sequences with brightness and texture consistency with the original input. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on our real-world and synthetic datasets with spikes validate the superior generalization of the proposed framework. Our code, data and trained models will be available at \url{https://github.com/chenkang455/S-SDM}.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Video sentence grounding with temporally global textual knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13611v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal sentence grounding involves the retrieval of a video moment with a natural language query. Many existing works directly incorporate the given video and temporally localized query for temporal grounding, overlooking the inherent domain gap between different modalities. In this paper, we utilize pseudo-query features containing extensive temporally global textual knowledge sourced from the same video-query pair, to enhance the bridging of domain gaps and attain a heightened level of similarity between multi-modal features. Specifically, we propose a Pseudo-query Intermediary Network (PIN) to achieve an improved alignment of visual and comprehensive pseudo-query features within the feature space through contrastive learning. Subsequently, we utilize learnable prompts to encapsulate the knowledge of pseudo-queries, propagating them into the textual encoder and multi-modal fusion module, further enhancing the feature alignment between visual and language for better temporal grounding. Extensive experiments conducted on the Charades-STA and ActivityNet-Captions datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v2)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[DOCTOR: Dynamic On-Chip Temporal Variation Remediation Toward Self-Corrected Photonic Tensor Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02688v2)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photonic computing has emerged as a promising solution for accelerating computation-intensive artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, offering unparalleled speed and energy efficiency, especially in resource-limited, latency-sensitive edge computing environments. However, the deployment of analog photonic tensor accelerators encounters reliability challenges due to hardware noise and environmental variations. While off-chip noise-aware training and on-chip training have been proposed to enhance the variation tolerance of optical neural accelerators with moderate, static noise, we observe a notable performance degradation over time due to temporally drifting variations, which requires a real-time, in-situ calibration mechanism. To tackle this challenging reliability issues, for the first time, we propose a lightweight dynamic on-chip remediation framework, dubbed DOCTOR, providing adaptive, in-situ accuracy recovery against temporally drifting noise. The DOCTOR framework intelligently monitors the chip status using adaptive probing and performs fast in-situ training-free calibration to restore accuracy when necessary. Recognizing nonuniform spatial variation distributions across devices and tensor cores, we also propose a variation-aware architectural remapping strategy to avoid executing critical tasks on noisy devices. Extensive experiments show that our proposed framework can guarantee sustained performance under drifting variations with 34% higher accuracy and 2-3 orders-of-magnitude lower overhead compared to state-of-the-art on-chip training methods.

Although recent DETR-based models have achieved notable progress by leveraging multiple learnable moment queries, they suffer from overlapped and redundant proposals, leading to inaccurate predictions. We attribute this limitation to the lack of task-related guidance for the learnable queries to serve a specific mode. Furthermore, the complex solution space generated by variable and open-vocabulary language descriptions exacerbates the optimization difficulty, making it harder for learnable queries to distinguish each other adaptively. To tackle this limitation, we present a Region-Guided TRansformer (RGTR) for temporal sentence grounding, which diversifies moment queries to eliminate overlapped and redundant predictions. Instead of using learnable queries, RGTR adopts a set of anchor pairs as moment queries to introduce explicit regional guidance. Each anchor pair takes charge of moment prediction for a specific temporal region, which reduces the optimization difficulty and ensures the diversity of the final predictions. In addition, we design an IoU-aware scoring head to improve proposal quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of RGTR, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on QVHighlights, Charades-STA and TACoS datasets.</p></details> |  |

We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

Previous research on this topic has been limited in scope, characterized by a lack of standardized benchmarks that would allow for consistent evaluations across different studies. In this paper, we introduce TRAM, a temporal reasoning benchmark composed of ten datasets, encompassing various temporal aspects of events such as order, arithmetic, frequency, and duration, designed to facilitate a comprehensive evaluation of the TeR capabilities of large language models (LLMs). We evaluate popular LLMs like GPT-4 and Llama2 in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, and establish baselines with BERT-based and domain-specific models. Our findings indicate that the best-performing model lags significantly behind human performance. It is our aspiration that TRAM will spur further progress in enhancing the TeR capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2024 |

It is commonly used for specifying requirements in various domains, including hardware and software systems, as well as robotics. Specification mining or formula generation involves extracting temporal logic formulae from system traces and has numerous applications, such as detecting bugs and improving interpretability. Although there has been a surge of deep learning-based methods for temporal logic satisfiability checking in recent years, the specification mining literature has been lagging behind in adopting deep learning methods despite their many advantages, such as scalability. In this paper, we introduce autoregressive models that can generate linear temporal logic formulae from traces, towards addressing the specification mining problem. We propose multiple architectures for this task: transformer encoder-decoder, decoder-only transformer, and Mamba, which is an emerging alternative to transformer models. Additionally, we devise a metric for quantifying the distinctiveness of the generated formulae and a straightforward algorithm to enforce the syntax constraints. Our experiments show that the proposed architectures yield promising results, generating correct and distinct formulae at a fraction of the compute cost needed for the combinatorial baseline.</p></details> | 20 pages, 15 figures |

It also necessitates coherent forecasts across all levels of the hierarchy to ensure aligned decision making across different planning units such as pricing, product, controlling and strategy. Given that platform data streams feature complex characteristics and interdependencies, we introduce a non-linear hierarchical forecast reconciliation method that produces cross-temporal reconciled forecasts in a direct and automated way through the use of popular machine learning methods. The method is sufficiently fast to allow forecast-based high-frequency decision making that platforms require. We empirically test our framework on unique, large-scale streaming datasets from a leading on-demand delivery platform in Europe and a bicycle sharing system in New York City.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their high performance, these approaches frequently involve complex training pipelines and a substantial computational burden, limiting the scalability and compatibility of these methods. In this paper, we propose a PrevMatch framework that effectively mitigates the aforementioned limitations by maximizing the utilization of the temporal knowledge obtained during the training process. The PrevMatch framework relies on two core strategies: (1) we reconsider the use of temporal knowledge and thus directly utilize previous models obtained during training to generate additional pseudo-label guidance, referred to as previous guidance. (2) we design a highly randomized ensemble strategy to maximize the effectiveness of the previous guidance. Experimental results on four benchmark semantic segmentation datasets confirm that the proposed method consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation protocols. In particular, with DeepLabV3+ and ResNet-101 network settings, PrevMatch outperforms the existing state-of-the-art method, Diverse Co-training, by +1.6 mIoU on Pascal VOC with only 92 annotated images, while achieving 2.4 times faster training. Furthermore, the results indicate that PrevMatch induces stable optimization, particularly in benefiting classes that exhibit poor performance.

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

Although the logic is in general highly undecidable, the idea of using it as a specification language for the verification of complex infinite-state systems is appealing. However, a missing piece, which has proved to be an invaluable tool in dealing with other temporal logics, is an automaton model capable of capturing the logic. In this paper we address this issue, by defining and studying such a model, which we call first-order automaton. We define this very general class of automata, and the corresponding notion of regular first-order language, showing their closure under most common language-theoretic operations. We show how they can capture any FOLTL formula over any signature and theory, and provide sufficient conditions for the semi-decidability of their non-emptiness problem. Then, to show the usefulness of the formalism, we prove the decidability of monodic FOLTL, a classic result known in the literature, with a simpler and direct proof.</p></details> |  |

While some recent methods can robustly identify these latent causal variables, they rely on strict assumptions about the invertible generation process from latent variables to observed data. However, these assumptions are often hard to satisfy in real-world applications containing information loss. For instance, the visual perception process translates a 3D space into 2D images, or the phenomenon of persistence of vision incorporates historical data into current perceptions. To address this challenge, we establish an identifiability theory that allows for the recovery of independent latent components even when they come from a nonlinear and non-invertible mix. Using this theory as a foundation, we propose a principled approach, CaRiNG, to learn the CAusal RepresentatIon of Non-invertible Generative temporal data with identifiability guarantees. Specifically, we utilize temporal context to recover lost latent information and apply the conditions in our theory to guide the training process. Through experiments conducted on synthetic datasets, we validate that our CaRiNG method reliably identifies the causal process, even when the generation process is non-invertible. Moreover, we demonstrate that our approach considerably improves temporal understanding and reasoning in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICML 2024, 24 pages</p></details> |

However, challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial resolution impede accurate feature extraction from EEG signals, thereby affecting the classification accuracy of different actions. To address these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end dual-branch network (EEG-DBNet) that decodes the temporal and spectral sequences of EEG signals in parallel through two distinct network branches. Each branch comprises a local convolutional block and a global convolutional block. The local convolutional block transforms the source signal from the temporal-spatial domain to the temporal-spectral domain. By varying the number of filters and convolution kernel sizes, the local convolutional blocks in different branches adjust the length of their respective dimension sequences. Different types of pooling layers are then employed to emphasize the features of various dimension sequences, setting the stage for subsequent global feature extraction. The global convolution block splits and reconstructs the feature of the signal sequence processed by the local convolution block in the same branch and further extracts features through the dilated causal convolutional neural networks. Finally, the outputs from the two branches are concatenated, and signal classification is completed via a fully connected layer. Our proposed method achieves classification accuracies of 85.84% and 91.60% on the BCI Competition 4-2a and BCI Competition 4-2b datasets, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models.

Although multi-view spatial images and temporal sequences of image-report pairs are available in off-the-shelf multi-modal medical datasets, most existing methods have not thoroughly tapped into such extensive supervision signals. In this paper, we introduce the Med-ST framework for fine-grained spatial and temporal modeling to exploit information from multiple spatial views of chest radiographs and temporal historical records. For spatial modeling, Med-ST employs the Mixture of View Expert (MoVE) architecture to integrate different visual features from both frontal and lateral views. To achieve a more comprehensive alignment, Med-ST not only establishes the global alignment between whole images and texts but also introduces modality-weighted local alignment between text tokens and spatial regions of images. For temporal modeling, we propose a novel cross-modal bidirectional cycle consistency objective by forward mapping classification (FMC) and reverse mapping regression (RMR). By perceiving temporal information from simple to complex, Med-ST can learn temporal semantics. Experimental results across four distinct tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Med-ST, especially in temporal classification tasks.

Despite advances in remote sensing data for urban monitoring, coarse-grained classification systems and the lack of continuous temporal observations hinder the application of deep learning to urban change analysis. To address this, we introduce FUSU, a multi-source, multi-temporal change segmentation dataset for fine-grained urban semantic understanding. FUSU features the most detailed land use classification system to date, with 17 classes and 30 billion pixels of annotations. It includes bi-temporal high-resolution satellite images with 20-50 cm ground sample distance and monthly optical and radar satellite time series, covering 847 km2 across five urban areas in China. The fine-grained pixel-wise annotations and high spatial-temporal resolution data provide a robust foundation for deep learning models to understand urbanization and land use changes.

The primary challenge in achieving precise load forecasting for EVCS lies in accounting for the nonlinear of charging behaviors, the spatial interactions among different stations, and the intricate temporal variations in usage patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model (MSTEM) for effective load forecasting at EVCS. MSTEM incorporates a multiscale graph neural network to discern hierarchical nonlinear temporal dependencies across various time scales. Besides, it also integrates a recurrent learning component and a residual fusion mechanism, enhancing its capability to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations in charging patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MSTEM has been validated through comparative analysis with six baseline models using three evaluation metrics. The case studies utilize real-world datasets for both fast and slow charging loads at EVCS in Perth, UK. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MSTEM in short-term continuous load forecasting for EVCS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, AEEES 2024</p></details> |
| **[Generalizing Weather Forecast to Fine-grained Temporal Scales via Physics-AI Hybrid Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13796v3)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models have made significant advancements in weather forecasting, particularly in medium-range and nowcasting. However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box systems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical evolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal scale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales. This paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which Generalizes weather forecasts to Finer-grained Temporal scales beyond training dataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate physical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel neural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we introduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of the model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules indicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections adaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly dataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple lead times and exhibits the capability to generalize 30-minute forecasts.</p></details> |  |

While Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have been effective in scene reconstruction, their slow inference speeds and lengthy training durations limit their applicability. To overcome these limitations, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) based methods have emerged as a recent trend, offering rapid inference capabilities and superior 3D quality. However, these methods still struggle with under-reconstruction in both static and dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose HFGS, a novel approach for deformable endoscopic reconstruction that addresses these challenges from spatial and temporal frequency perspectives. Our approach incorporates deformation fields to better handle dynamic scenes and introduces Spatial High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (SHF) to minimize discrepancies in spatial frequency spectra between the rendered image and its ground truth. Additionally, we introduce Temporal High-Frequency Emphasis Reconstruction (THF) to enhance dynamic awareness in neural rendering by leveraging flow priors, focusing optimization on motion-intensive parts. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks demonstrate that HFGS achieves superior rendering quality. Our code will be available.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Models for this task are usually trained with human-annotated sentences and bounding box supervision. This work addresses this task from a multimodal supervision perspective, proposing a framework for spatio-temporal action grounding trained on loose video and subtitle supervision only, without human annotation. To this end, we combine local representation learning, which focuses on leveraging fine-grained spatial information, with a global representation encoding that captures higher-level representations and incorporates both in a joint approach. To evaluate this challenging task in a real-life setting, a new benchmark dataset is proposed providing dense spatio-temporal grounding annotations in long, untrimmed, multi-action instructional videos for over 5K events. We evaluate the proposed approach and other methods on the proposed and standard downstream tasks showing that our method improves over current baselines in various settings, including spatial, temporal, and untrimmed multi-action spatio-temporal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at CVPR 2024.

However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Both of them draw plenty of research interest and have great significance. Methods of the former de-emphasize the temporal correlations among facts sequences, while methods of the latter require strict chronological order of knowledge and ignore inferring clues provided by missing facts of the past. These limit the practicability of TKG applications as almost all of the existing TKG reasoning methods are designed specifically to address either one setting. To this end, this paper proposes an original Temporal PAth-based Reasoning (TPAR) model for both the interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. TPAR performs a neural-driven symbolic reasoning fashion that is robust to ambiguous and noisy temporal data and with fine interpretability as well. Comprehensive experiments show that TPAR outperforms SOTA methods on the link prediction task for both the interpolation and the extrapolation settings. A novel pipeline experimental setting is designed to evaluate the performances of SOTA combinations and the proposed TPAR towards interpolation and extrapolation reasoning. More diverse experiments are conducted to show the robustness and interpretability of TPAR.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Spanning Training Progress: Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS) for Enhanced Dataset Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13613v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset pruning aims to construct a coreset capable of achieving performance comparable to the original, full dataset. Most existing dataset pruning methods rely on snapshot-based criteria to identify representative samples, often resulting in poor generalization across various pruning and cross-architecture scenarios. Recent studies have addressed this issue by expanding the scope of training dynamics considered, including factors such as forgetting event and probability change, typically using an averaging approach. However, these works struggle to integrate a broader range of training dynamics without overlooking well-generalized samples, which may not be sufficiently highlighted in an averaging manner. In this study, we propose a novel dataset pruning method termed as Temporal Dual-Depth Scoring (TDDS), to tackle this problem. TDDS utilizes a dual-depth strategy to achieve a balance between incorporating extensive training dynamics and identifying representative samples for dataset pruning. In the first depth, we estimate the series of each sample's individual contributions spanning the training progress, ensuring comprehensive integration of training dynamics. In the second depth, we focus on the variability of the sample-wise contributions identified in the first depth to highlight well-generalized samples. Extensive experiments conducted on CIFAR and ImageNet datasets verify the superiority of TDDS over previous SOTA methods. Specifically on CIFAR-100, our method achieves 54.51% accuracy with only 10% training data, surpassing random selection by 7.83% and other comparison methods by at least 12.69%.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |
| **[On Robust Clustering of Temporal Point Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17828v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clustering of event stream data is of great importance in many application scenarios, including but not limited to, e-commerce, electronic health, online testing, mobile music service, etc. Existing clustering algorithms fail to take outlier data into consideration and are implemented without theoretical guarantees. In this paper, we propose a robust temporal point processes clustering framework which works under mild assumptions and meanwhile addresses several important issues in the event stream clustering problem.Specifically, we introduce a computationally efficient model-free distance function to quantify the dissimilarity between different event streams so that the outliers can be detected and the good initial clusters could be obtained. We further consider an expectation-maximization-type algorithm incorporated with a Catoni's influence function for robust estimation and fine-tuning of clusters. We also establish the theoretical results including algorithmic convergence, estimation error bound, outlier detection, etc. Simulation results corroborate our theoretical findings and real data applications show the effectiveness of our proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMSGL: Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02646v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting in various domains, like traffic prediction and weather forecasting, is a challenging endeavor, primarily due to the difficulties in modeling propagation dynamics and capturing high-dimensional interactions among nodes. Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | Accepted by Chaos |
| **[Independence Testing for Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06486v5)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal data are increasingly prevalent in modern data science. A fundamental question is whether two time series are related or not. Existing approaches often have limitations, such as relying on parametric assumptions, detecting only linear associations, and requiring multiple tests and corrections. While many non-parametric and universally consistent dependence measures have recently been proposed, directly applying them to temporal data can inflate the p-value and result in an invalid test. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the temporal dependence statistic with block permutation to test independence between temporal data. Under proper assumptions, the proposed procedure is asymptotically valid and universally consistent for testing independence between stationary time series, and capable of estimating the optimal dependence lag that maximizes the dependence. Moreover, it is compatible with a rich family of distance and kernel based dependence measures, eliminates the need for multiple testing, and exhibits excellent testing power in various simulation settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages main + 6 pages appendix</p></details> |
| **[The surprising efficiency of temporal difference learning for rare event prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17638v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We quantify the efficiency of temporal difference (TD) learning over the direct, or Monte Carlo (MC), estimator for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning, with an emphasis on estimation of quantities related to rare events. Policy evaluation is complicated in the rare event setting by the long timescale of the event and by the need for \emph{relative accuracy} in estimates of very small values. Specifically, we focus on least-squares TD (LSTD) prediction for finite state Markov chains, and show that LSTD can achieve relative accuracy far more efficiently than MC. We prove a central limit theorem for the LSTD estimator and upper bound the \emph{relative asymptotic variance} by simple quantities characterizing the connectivity of states relative to the transition probabilities between them. Using this bound, we show that, even when both the timescale of the rare event and the relative accuracy of the MC estimator are exponentially large in the number of states, LSTD maintains a fixed level of relative accuracy with a total number of observed transitions of the Markov chain that is only \emph{polynomially} large in the number of states.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaussian Embedding of Temporal Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17253v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Representing the nodes of continuous-time temporal graphs in a low-dimensional latent space has wide-ranging applications, from prediction to visualization. Yet, analyzing continuous-time relational data with timestamped interactions introduces unique challenges due to its sparsity. Merely embedding nodes as trajectories in the latent space overlooks this sparsity, emphasizing the need to quantify uncertainty around the latent positions. In this paper, we propose TGNE (\textbf{T}emporal \textbf{G}aussian \textbf{N}etwork \textbf{E}mbedding), an innovative method that bridges two distinct strands of literature: the statistical analysis of networks via Latent Space Models (LSM)\cite{Hoff2002} and temporal graph machine learning. TGNE embeds nodes as piece-wise linear trajectories of Gaussian distributions in the latent space, capturing both structural information and uncertainty around the trajectories. We evaluate TGNE's effectiveness in reconstructing the original graph and modelling uncertainty. The results demonstrate that TGNE generates competitive time-varying embedding locations compared to common baselines for reconstructing unobserved edge interactions based on observed edges. Furthermore, the uncertainty estimates align with the time-varying degree distribution in the network, providing valuable insights into the temporal dynamics of the graph. To facilitate reproducibility, we provide an open-source implementation of TGNE at \url{https://github.com/aida-ugent/tgne}.</p></details> |  |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

A significant question is how SNNs can emulate human-like graph-based reasoning of concepts and relations, especially leveraging the temporal domain optimally. This paper reveals that SNNs, when amalgamated with synaptic delay and temporal coding, are proficient in executing (knowledge) graph reasoning. It is elucidated that spiking time can function as an additional dimension to encode relation properties via a neural-generalized path formulation. Empirical results highlight the efficacy of temporal delay in relation processing and showcase exemplary performance in diverse graph reasoning tasks. The spiking model is theoretically estimated to achieve $20\times$ energy savings compared to non-spiking counterparts, deepening insights into the capabilities and potential of biologically inspired SNNs for efficient reasoning.

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over the large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the dynamic evolution of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model during inference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to the model (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-label pairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for the query instance according to the context during inference. A possible explanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear) transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-label pairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformers can also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, a phenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence of in-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm, accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformers are expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms in the forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, and average-reward TD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion4D: Fast Spatial-temporal Consistent 4D Generation via Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16645v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of large-scale multimodal datasets and advancements in diffusion models have significantly accelerated progress in 4D content generation. Most prior approaches rely on multiple image or video diffusion models, utilizing score distillation sampling for optimization or generating pseudo novel views for direct supervision. However, these methods are hindered by slow optimization speeds and multi-view inconsistency issues. Spatial and temporal consistency in 4D geometry has been extensively explored respectively in 3D-aware diffusion models and traditional monocular video diffusion models. Building on this foundation, we propose a strategy to migrate the temporal consistency in video diffusion models to the spatial-temporal consistency required for 4D generation. Specifically, we present a novel framework, \textbf{Diffusion4D}, for efficient and scalable 4D content generation. Leveraging a meticulously curated dynamic 3D dataset, we develop a 4D-aware video diffusion model capable of synthesizing orbital views of dynamic 3D assets. To control the dynamic strength of these assets, we introduce a 3D-to-4D motion magnitude metric as guidance. Additionally, we propose a novel motion magnitude reconstruction loss and 3D-aware classifier-free guidance to refine the learning and generation of motion dynamics. After obtaining orbital views of the 4D asset, we perform explicit 4D construction with Gaussian splatting in a coarse-to-fine manner. The synthesized multi-view consistent 4D image set enables us to swiftly generate high-fidelity and diverse 4D assets within just several minutes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art techniques in terms of generation efficiency and 4D geometry consistency across various prompt modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://vita-group.github.io/Diffusion4D</p></details> |

| **[RealTCD: Temporal Causal Discovery from Interventional Data with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14786v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of Artificial Intelligence for Information Technology Operations, causal discovery is pivotal for operation and maintenance of graph construction, facilitating downstream industrial tasks such as root cause analysis. Temporal causal discovery, as an emerging method, aims to identify temporal causal relationships between variables directly from observations by utilizing interventional data. However, existing methods mainly focus on synthetic datasets with heavy reliance on intervention targets and ignore the textual information hidden in real-world systems, failing to conduct causal discovery for real industrial scenarios. To tackle this problem, in this paper we propose to investigate temporal causal discovery in industrial scenarios, which faces two critical challenges: 1) how to discover causal relationships without the interventional targets that are costly to obtain in practice, and 2) how to discover causal relations via leveraging the textual information in systems which can be complex yet abundant in industrial contexts. To address these challenges, we propose the RealTCD framework, which is able to leverage domain knowledge to discover temporal causal relationships without interventional targets. Specifically, we first develop a score-based temporal causal discovery method capable of discovering causal relations for root cause analysis without relying on interventional targets through strategic masking and regularization. Furthermore, by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to handle texts and integrate domain knowledge, we introduce LLM-guided meta-initialization to extract the meta-knowledge from textual information hidden in systems to boost the quality of discovery. We conduct extensive experiments on simulation and real-world datasets to show the superiority of our proposed RealTCD framework over existing baselines in discovering temporal causal structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[A logic for temporal conditionals and a solution to the Sea Battle Puzzle](http://arxiv.org/abs/1711.02843v2)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal reasoning with conditionals is more complex than both classical temporal reasoning and reasoning with timeless conditionals, and can lead to some rather counter-intuitive conclusions. For instance, Aristotle's famous "Sea Battle Tomorrow" puzzle leads to a fatalistic conclusion: whether there will be a sea battle tomorrow or not, but that is necessarily the case now. We propose a branching-time logic LTC to formalise reasoning about temporal conditionals and provide that logic with adequate formal semantics. The logic LTC extends the Nexttime fragment of CTL*, with operators for model updates, restricting the domain to only future moments where antecedent is still possible to satisfy. We provide formal semantics for these operators that implements the restrictor interpretation of antecedents of temporalized conditionals, by suitably restricting the domain of discourse. As a motivating example, we demonstrate that a naturally formalised in our logic version of the `Sea Battle' argument renders it unsound, thereby providing a solution to the problem with fatalist conclusion that it entails, because its underlying reasoning per cases argument no longer applies when these cases are treated not as material implications but as temporal conditionals. On the technical side, we analyze the semantics of LTC and provide a series of reductions of LTC-formulae, first recursively eliminating the dynamic update operators and then the path quantifiers in such formulae. Using these reductions we obtain a sound and complete axiomatization for LTC, and reduce its decision problem to that of the modal logic KD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Advances in Modal Logic.

Current training methods cannot simultaneously solve both training and inference dilemmas. This work proposes a novel Temporal Reversible architecture for SNNs (T-RevSNN) to jointly address the training and inference challenges by altering the forward propagation of SNNs. We turn off the temporal dynamics of most spiking neurons and design multi-level temporal reversible interactions at temporal turn-on spiking neurons, resulting in a $O(L)$ training memory. Combined with the temporal reversible nature, we redesign the input encoding and network organization of SNNs to achieve $O(1)$ inference energy cost. Then, we finely adjust the internal units and residual connections of the basic SNN block to ensure the effectiveness of sparse temporal information interaction. T-RevSNN achieves excellent accuracy on ImageNet, while the memory efficiency, training time acceleration, and inference energy efficiency can be significantly improved by $8.6 \times$, $2.0 \times$, and $1.6 \times$, respectively. This work is expected to break the technical bottleneck of significantly increasing memory cost and training time for large-scale SNNs while maintaining high performance and low inference energy cost.

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16075v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Domain Generalization (TDG) addresses the challenge of training predictive models under temporally varying data distributions. Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To improve the efficiency while keeping the performance, we present a novel perspective centered on per-segment classification. By harnessing the capabilities of Transformers, we tokenize each video segment as an instance token, endowed with intrinsic instance segmentation. To realize efficient action segmentation, we introduce BaFormer, a boundary-aware Transformer network. It employs instance queries for instance segmentation and a global query for class-agnostic boundary prediction, yielding continuous segment proposals. During inference, BaFormer employs a simple yet effective voting strategy to classify boundary-wise segments based on instance segmentation.

However, many methods that rely on filtering-based algorithms, such as the Kalman Filter, often work well in linear motion scenarios but struggle to accurately predict the locations of objects undergoing complex and non-linear movements. To tackle these scenarios, we propose a motion-based MOT approach with an enhanced temporal motion predictor, ETTrack. Specifically, the motion predictor integrates a transformer model and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture short-term and long-term motion patterns, and it predicts the future motion of individual objects based on the historical motion information. Additionally, we propose a novel Momentum Correction Loss function that provides additional information regarding the motion direction of objects during training. This allows the motion predictor rapidly adapt to motion variations and more accurately predict future motion. Our experimental results demonstrate that ETTrack achieves a competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art trackers on DanceTrack and SportsMOT, scoring 56.4% and 74.4% in HOTA metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

One critical aspect is formulating a consistency constraint specifically for temporal-spatial illumination and appearance enhanced versions, a dimension overlooked in existing methods. In this paper, we present an innovative video Retinex-based decomposition strategy that operates without the need for explicit supervision to delineate illumination and reflectance components. We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for intrinsic appearance and enforce a scene-level continuity constraint on the illumination field to yield satisfactory consistent decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a novel cross-frame interaction mechanism. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features, thus achieving the desired temporal propagation. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios. Our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |

Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a crucial soil attribute providing valuable insights into soil health, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, and overall ecosystem productivity. This study highlights the significance of spatial-temporal deep learning (DL) techniques within the DSM framework. A novel architecture is proposed, incorporating spatial information using a base convolutional neural network (CNN) model and spatial attention mechanism, along with climate temporal information using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, for SOC prediction across Europe. The model utilizes a comprehensive set of environmental features, including Landsat-8 images, topography, remote sensing indices, and climate time series, as input features. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional ML approaches like random forest commonly used in DSM, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE). This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and could be applied to other soil properties, thereby contributing to the advancement of DSM techniques and facilitating land management and decision-making processes based on accurate information.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, inherent physical and technical constraints of imaging hardware often necessitate a compromise between temporal resolution and image quality. Frame interpolation emerges as a pivotal solution to this challenge. Previous methods often suffer from discretion when they estimate the intermediate motion and execute the forward warping. In this study, we draw inspiration from fluid mechanics to propose a novel approach for continuously modeling patient anatomic motion using implicit neural representation. It ensures both spatial and temporal continuity, effectively bridging Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications together to naturally facilitate continuous frame interpolation. Our experiments across multiple datasets underscore the method's superior accuracy and speed. Furthermore, as a case-specific optimization (training-free) approach, it circumvents the need for extensive datasets and addresses model generalization issues.</p></details> |  |

We investigate conditions under which estimation is feasible and of good overall quality and obtain sharp approximations that we employ to devising statistical inference methodology. These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences.

| **[On the Identification of Temporally Causal Representation with Instantaneous Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15325v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally causal representation learning aims to identify the latent causal process from time series observations, but most methods require the assumption that the latent causal processes do not have instantaneous relations. Although some recent methods achieve identifiability in the instantaneous causality case, they require either interventions on the latent variables or grouping of the observations, which are in general difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose an \textbf{ID}entification framework for instantane\textbf{O}us \textbf{L}atent dynamics (\textbf{IDOL}) by imposing a sparse influence constraint that the latent causal processes have sparse time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Specifically, we establish identifiability results of the latent causal process based on sufficient variability and the sparse influence constraint by employing contextual information of time series data. Based on these theories, we incorporate a temporally variational inference architecture to estimate the latent variables and a gradient-based sparsity regularization to identify the latent causal process. Experimental results on simulation datasets illustrate that our method can identify the latent causal process. Furthermore, evaluations on multiple human motion forecasting benchmarks with instantaneous dependencies indicate the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |

Prior works have attempted to address this challenge by creating self-supervised auxiliary tasks, aiming to enrich the agent's learned representations with control-relevant information for future state prediction. However, these objectives are often insufficient to learn representations that can represent the optimal policy or value function, and they often consider tasks with small, abstract discrete action spaces and thus overlook the importance of action representation learning in continuous control. In this paper, we introduce TACO: Temporal Action-driven Contrastive Learning, a simple yet powerful temporal contrastive learning approach that facilitates the concurrent acquisition of latent state and action representations for agents. TACO simultaneously learns a state and an action representation by optimizing the mutual information between representations of current states paired with action sequences and representations of the corresponding future states. Theoretically, TACO can be shown to learn state and action representations that encompass sufficient information for control, thereby improving sample efficiency. For online RL, TACO achieves 40% performance boost after one million environment interaction steps on average across nine challenging visual continuous control tasks from Deepmind Control Suite. In addition, we show that TACO can also serve as a plug-and-play module adding to existing offline visual RL methods to establish the new state-of-the-art performance for offline visual RL across offline datasets with varying quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |

However, the inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

The utilization of DRL for decision-making facilitates dynamic interaction with the environment, generating control actions aimed at maximizing cumulative rewards. Nevertheless, the inherent uncertainty of the operational environment and the intricate nature of ICPS necessitate exploration within complex and dynamic state spaces during the learning phase. DRL confronts challenges in terms of efficiency, generalization capabilities, and data scarcity during decision-making process. In response to these challenges, we propose an innovative abstract modeling approach grounded in spatial-temporal value semantics, capturing the evolution in the distribution of semantic value across time and space. A semantics-based abstraction is introduced to construct an abstract Markov Decision Process (MDP) for the DRL learning process. Furthermore, optimization techniques for abstraction are delineated, aiming to refine the abstract model and mitigate semantic gaps between abstract and concrete states. The efficacy of the abstract modeling is assessed through the evaluation and analysis of the abstract MDP model using PRISM. A series of experiments are conducted, involving diverse scenarios such as lane-keeping, adaptive cruise control, and intersection crossroad assistance, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our abstracting approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 7 figures, conference</p></details> |

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |

The model takes as inputs sequences of stamp images and metadata contained in each alert, as well as features from the All-WISE catalog. The proposed model, called temporal stamp classifier, is able to discriminate between three classes of astronomical objects: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Super-Novae (SNe) and Variable Stars (VS), with an accuracy of approximately 98% in the test set, when using 2 to 5 detections. The results show that the model performance improves with the addition of more detections. Simple recurrence models obtain competitive results with those of more complex models such as LSTM.We also propose changes to the original stamp classifier model, which only uses the first detection. The performance of the latter model improves with changes in the architecture and the addition of random rotations, achieving a 1.46% increase in test accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2024</p></details> |

But with increasing task complexity, LTL formulas unavoidably grow lengthy, complicating interpretation and specification generation, and straining the computational capacities of the planners. A recent development has been the hierarchical representation of LTL~\cite{luo2024simultaneous} that contains multiple temporal logic specifications, providing a more interpretable framework. However, the proposed planning algorithm assumes the independence of robots within each specification, limiting their application to multi-robot coordination with complex temporal constraints. In this work, we formulated a decomposition-based hierarchical framework. At the high level, each specification is first decomposed into a set of atomic sub-tasks. We further infer the temporal relations among the sub-tasks of different specifications to construct a task network. Subsequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Program is used to assign sub-tasks to various robots. At the lower level, domain-specific controllers are employed to execute sub-tasks. Our approach was experimentally applied to domains of navigation and manipulation. The simulation demonstrated that our approach can find better solutions using less runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

However, it has two critical issues: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, especially weight decay, and unsatisfactory performance in online and continual learning, where neuroscientists believe that powerful memory functions are necessary, as in brains. In this paper, we propose PhiNet, inspired by a hippocampal model based on the temporal prediction hypothesis. Unlike SimSiam, which aligns two augmented views of the original image, PhiNet integrates an additional predictor block that estimates the original image representation to imitate the CA1 region in the hippocampus. Moreover, we model the neocortex inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems theory with a momentum encoder block as a slow learner, which works as long-term memory. We demonstrate through analysing the learning dynamics that PhiNet benefits from the additional predictor to prevent the complete collapse of learned representations, a notorious challenge in non-contrastive learning. This dynamics analysis may partially corroborate why this hippocampal model is biologically plausible. Experimental results demonstrate that PhiNet is more robust to weight decay and performs better than SimSiam in memory-intensive tasks like online and continual learning.</p></details> |  |

The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing.

Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.

This design captures and utilizes temporal dependencies, significantly enhancing the generative capabilities of SNNs. Neuroscientific research has identified hippocampal "time cells" that fire sequentially during temporally structured experiences. Our temporal codebook emulates this behavior by triggering the activation of time cell populations based on similarity measures as input stimuli pass through it. We conducted extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CelebA, and downsampled LSUN Bedroom, to validate our model's performance. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the temporal codebook on neuromorphic datasets NMNIST and DVS-CIFAR10, and demonstrated the model's capability with high-resolution datasets such as CelebA-HQ, LSUN Bedroom, and LSUN Church. The experimental results indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing SNN-based generative models across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our approach excels in generating high-resolution and temporally consistent data, underscoring the crucial role of temporal information in SNN-based generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant advancements, existing methods face challenges in managing confidence bias towards salient objects and capturing long-term dependencies in video sequences. To address these issues, we introduce SpikeMba: a multi-modal spiking saliency mamba for temporal video grounding. Our approach integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with state space models (SSMs) to leverage their unique advantages in handling different aspects of the task. Specifically, we use SNNs to develop a spiking saliency detector that generates the proposal set. The detector emits spike signals when the input signal exceeds a predefined threshold, resulting in a dynamic and binary saliency proposal set. To enhance the model's capability to retain and infer contextual information, we introduce relevant slots which learnable tensors that encode prior knowledge. These slots work with the contextual moment reasoner to maintain a balance between preserving contextual information and exploring semantic relevance dynamically. The SSMs facilitate selective information propagation, addressing the challenge of long-term dependency in video content. By combining SNNs for proposal generation and SSMs for effective contextual reasoning, SpikeMba addresses confidence bias and long-term dependencies, thereby significantly enhancing fine-grained multimodal relationship capture. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpikeMba, which consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across mainstream benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Despite the recognized importance of this task, a notable gap exists due to the discreteness of symbolic representations and the continuous nature of machine-learning computations. One of the desired bridges between these two worlds would be to define semantically grounded vector representation (feature embedding) of logic formulae, thus enabling to perform continuous learning and optimization in the semantic space of formulae. We tackle this goal for knowledge expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and devise a method to compute continuous embeddings of formulae with several desirable properties: the embedding (i) is finite-dimensional, (ii) faithfully reflects the semantics of the formulae, (iii) does not require any learning but instead is defined from basic principles, (iv) is interpretable. Another significant contribution lies in demonstrating the efficacy of the approach in two tasks: learning model checking, where we predict the probability of requirements being satisfied in stochastic processes; and integrating the embeddings into a neuro-symbolic framework, to constrain the output of a deep-learning generative model to comply to a given logical specification.</p></details> |  |

Existing TAS methods are constrained to offline scenarios due to their heavy reliance on multimodal features and complete contextual information. The STAS task requires the model to classify each frame of the entire untrimmed video sequence clip by clip in time, thereby extending the applicability of TAS methods to online scenarios. However, directly applying existing TAS methods to SATS tasks results in significantly poor segmentation outcomes. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the fundamental differences between STAS tasks and TAS tasks, attributing the severe performance degradation when transferring models to model bias and optimization dilemmas. We introduce an end-to-end streaming video temporal action segmentation model with reinforcement learning (SVTAS-RL). The end-to-end modeling method mitigates the modeling bias introduced by the change in task nature and enhances the feasibility of online solutions. Reinforcement learning is utilized to alleviate the optimization dilemma. Through extensive experiments, the SVTAS-RL model significantly outperforms existing STAS models and achieves competitive performance to the state-of-the-art TAS model on multiple datasets under the same evaluation criteria, demonstrating notable advantages on the ultra-long video dataset EGTEA.

In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2024)</p></details> |

Automatically modeling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal labels for an existing dataset of children's stories originally annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the categorical labels to the continuous valence and arousal space. For predicting the thus obtained emotionality signals, we fine-tune a DeBERTa model and improve upon this baseline via a weakly supervised learning approach. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of $.8221$ for valence and $.7125$ for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach.

| **[Unveiling the Cycloid Trajectory of EM Iterations in Mixed Linear Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18237v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the trajectory of iterations and the convergence rates of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR). The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</p></details> |  |

First, we use the blocking technique to show that RCPS attains performance guarantees similar to those enjoyed in the iid setting whenever data is generated by asymptotically stationary and contractive dynamics. Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity. We conclude by discussing how these tools could be used toward a unified analysis of online and offline conformal prediction algorithms, which are currently treated with very different tools.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In this work, we investigate cognitive radio networks (CRNs) by jointly designing three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and user scheduling. Considering the UAV's onboard energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated in which the average achievable rate of the considered system is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D trajectory, transmission power, and user scheduling. Due to the non-convex optimization problem, a lower bound on the average achievable rate is utilized to reduce the complexity of the solution. Subsequently, the original optimization problem is decoupled into four subproblems by using block coordinate descent, and each subproblem is transformed into manageable convex optimization problems by introducing slack variables and successive convex approximation. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the 3D trajectories of UAVs can enhance the average achievable rate of aerial CRNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures,submitted to the IEEE journal for review</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |
| **[Constraint-Aware Diffusion Models for Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00990v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The diffusion model has shown success in generating high-quality and diverse solutions to trajectory optimization problems. However, diffusion models with neural networks inevitably make prediction errors, which leads to constraint violations such as unmet goals or collisions. This paper presents a novel constraint-aware diffusion model for trajectory optimization. We introduce a novel hybrid loss function for training that minimizes the constraint violation of diffusion samples compared to the groundtruth while recovering the original data distribution. Our model is demonstrated on tabletop manipulation and two-car reach-avoid problems, outperforming traditional diffusion models in minimizing constraint violations while generating samples close to locally optimal solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCF: Cross Correcting Framework for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00749v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting future pedestrian trajectories is crucial across various domains. Due to the uncertainty in future pedestrian trajectories, it is important to learn complex spatio-temporal representations in multi-agent scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Cross-Correction Framework (CCF) to learn spatio-temporal representations of pedestrian trajectories better. Our framework consists of two trajectory prediction models, known as subnets, which share the same architecture and are trained with both cross-correction loss and trajectory prediction loss. Cross-correction leverages the learning from both subnets and enables them to refine their underlying representations of trajectories through a mutual correction mechanism. Specifically, we use the cross-correction loss to learn how to correct each other through an inter-subnet interaction. To induce diverse learning among the subnets, we use the transformed observed trajectories produced by a neural network as input to one subnet and the original observed trajectories as input to the other subnet. We utilize transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for each subnet to capture motion and social interaction among pedestrians. The encoder of the transformer captures motion patterns in trajectories, while the decoder focuses on pedestrian interactions with neighbors. Each subnet performs the primary task of predicting future trajectories (a regression task) along with the secondary task of classifying the predicted trajectories (a classification task). Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets such as ETH-UCY and SDD demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, CCF, in precisely predicting pedestrian future trajectories. We also conducted several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various modules and loss functions used in our approach.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[MINER-RRT*: A Hierarchical and Fast Trajectory Planning Framework in 3D Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00706v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for quadrotors in cluttered environments has been challenging in recent years. While many trajectory planning frameworks have been successful, there still exists potential for improvements, particularly in enhancing the speed of generating efficient trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical trajectory planning framework to reduce computational time and memory usage called MINER-RRT*, which consists of two main components. First, we propose a sampling-based path planning method boosted by neural networks, where the predicted heuristic region accelerates the convergence of rapidly-exploring random trees. Second, we utilize the optimal conditions derived from the quadrotor's differential flatness properties to construct polynomial trajectories that minimize control effort in multiple stages. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our method can generate high-quality trajectories with better performance in 3D cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Trajectory Generation for Bi-copter Flight in Tight Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00671v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike squared (or alike) quadrotors, elongated bi-copters leverage natural superiority in crossing tight spaces. To date, extensive works have focused on the design, modeling, and control of bi-copters. Besides, a proper motion planner utilizing bi-copters' shape characteristics is essential to efficiently and safely traverse tight spaces, yet it has rarely been studied. Current motion planning methods will significantly compromise their ability to traverse narrow spaces if the map is inflated based on the long dimension of the bi-copter. In this paper, we propose an efficient motion planning method that enables the safe navigation of bi-copters through narrow spaces. We first adapt a dynamic, feasible path-finding algorithm with whole-body collision checks to generate a collision-free path. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the position and rotation of the bi-copter to produce a trajectory that is safe, dynamically feasible, and smooth. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have been conducted to verify the reliability and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures |
| **[Learning to Approximate Particle Smoothing Trajectories via Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00561v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical systems from sparse observations is critical in numerous fields, including biology, finance, and physics. Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Stabilize Unknown LTI Systems on a Single Trajectory under Stochastic Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00234v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-objective variants of LSO struggle with poor initialization, local optima entrapment, and slow adaptation to dynamic environments. This study proposes a Dynamic Multi-Objective Lion Swarm Optimization with Multi-strategy Fusion (MF-DMOLSO) to overcome these challenges. MF-DMOLSO includes an initialization unit using chaotic mapping, a position update unit enhancing behavior patterns based on non-domination and diversity, and an external archive update unit. Evaluations on benchmark functions showed MF-DMOLSO outperformed existing algorithms achieving an accuracy that exceeds the comparison algorithm by 90%. Applied to 6R robot trajectory planning, MF-DMOLSO optimized running time and maximum acceleration to 8.3s and 0.3pi rad/s^2, respectively, achieving a set coverage rate of 70.97% compared to 2% by multi-objective particle swarm optimization, thus improving efficiency and reducing mechanical dither.</p></details> |  |

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

| **[Trajectory Forecasting through Low-Rank Adaptation of Discrete Latent Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20743v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Structure-Aware Lane Graph Transformer Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20121v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories for surrounding vehicles is vital for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes a Lane Graph Transformer (LGT) model with structure-aware capabilities. Its key contribution lies in encoding the map topology structure into the attention mechanism. To address variations in lane information from different directions, four Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) matrices are introduced to capture the local details of the map topology structure. Additionally, two Shortest Path Distance (SPD) matrices are employed to capture distance information between two accessible lanes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed LGT model achieves a significantly higher prediction performance on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Specifically, the minFDE$_6$ metric was decreased by 60.73% compared to the Argoverse 2 baseline model (Nearest Neighbor) and the b-minFDE$_6$ metric was reduced by 2.65% compared to the baseline LaneGCN model. Furthermore, ablation experiments demonstrated that the consideration of map topology structure led to a 4.24% drop in the b-minFDE$_6$ metric, validating the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Human Mobility: Inferring Semantics of Trajectories with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19850v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human mobility patterns is essential for various applications, from urban planning to public safety. The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys. To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns. This study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing the semantic analysis of trajectory data, paving the way for more sophisticated and accessible human mobility research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on three real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively. The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is instrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We rigorously evaluate our method by providing convergence guarantees and testing it on simulated cell data characterized by bifurcations and merges, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories, but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</p></details> |  |

Projecting Autonomous System Trajectories Into Naturalistic Behavior Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19292v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents operating around human actors must consider how their behaviors might affect those humans, even when not directly interacting with them. To this end, it is often beneficial to be predictable and appear naturalistic. Existing methods to address this problem use human actor intent modeling or imitation learning techniques, but these approaches rarely capture all possible motivations for human behavior or require significant amounts of data. In contrast, we propose a technique for modeling naturalistic behavior as a set of convex hulls computed over a relatively small dataset of human behavior. Given this set, we design an optimization-based filter which projects arbitrary trajectories into it to make them more naturalistic for autonomous agents to execute while also satisfying dynamics constraints. We demonstrate our methods on real-world human driving data from the inD intersection dataset (Bock et al., 2020).</p></details> |  |

DiPPeST achieves 92% success rate in obstacle avoidance for nominal environments and an average of 88% success rate when tested in environments that are up to 3.5 times more complex in pixel variation than DiPPeR. A visual-servoing framework is developed to allow for real-world execution, tested on the quadruped robot, achieving 80% success rate in different environments and showcasing improved behavior than complex state-of-the-art local planners, in narrow environments.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, weather and time-of-day may affect pedestrian behavior. In this paper, a new weather-time-trajectory fusion network (WTTFNet) is proposed to improve the performance of baseline deep neural network architecture. By incorporating weather and time-of-day information as an embedding structure, a novel WTTFNet based on gate multimodal unit is used to fuse the multimodal information and deep representation of trajectories. A joint loss function based on focal loss is used to co-optimize both the deep trajectory features and final classifier, which helps to improve the accuracy in predicting the intended destination of pedestrians and hence the trajectories under possible scenarios of class imbalances. Experimental results using the Osaka Asia and Pacific Trade Center (ATC) dataset shows improved performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art algorithms by 23.67% increase in classification accuracy, 9.16% and 7.07% reduction of average and final displacement error. The proposed approach may serve as an attractive approach for improving existing baseline trajectory prediction models when they are applied to scenarios with influences of weather-time conditions. It can be employed in numerous applications such as pedestrian facility engineering, public space development and technology-driven retail.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

This paper addresses the near danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off the common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models and ensure safety, but doing so introduces numerical approximation error conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach avoid methods in near-danger goal reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings.

| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Movement: Unified Trajectory Generation Model for Multi-Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17680v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding multi-agent behavior is critical across various fields. The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement.

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames. The code of this paper will also be open-sourced at: https://github.com/wsakobe/EF-Calib.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons as athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both the average performance level of the population, $g(t)$, at age $t$ and how each $i$-th athlete differs from the average $f_i(t)$. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into changes from season-to-season, termed the between-season performance trajectory, and within-season performance trajectories which are modelled by a constrained Bernstein polynomial. Hence, the specific focus of this project is to identify the differences in performance that exist both between and within-seasons for each athlete. For the implementation of the model an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm is used. An illustration of algorithm's performance on 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming in both female and male athletes is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Learning in Offline RL with Linear $q^π$-Realizability and Concentrability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16809v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution. However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states. The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v3)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |

We utilize OpenCV's CSRT algorithm to accurately track the baseball and fixed reference points in 2D video frames. These tracked pixel coordinates are then used as input features for our neural network model, which comprises multiple fully connected layers to map the 2D coordinates to 3D space. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled trajectories using a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer, optimizing the network to minimize prediction errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves high accuracy in reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D inputs. This method shows great potential for applications in sports analysis, coaching, and enhancing the accuracy of trajectory predictions in various sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v2)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel Optimal Flow Matching approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of trajectory data in terms of volume, density, and inter-person interactions, limits relevant studies from being comprehensive and interactive. We mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia and tackle the generalization problem stemming from the variety and heterogeneity of the trajectory descriptions.

Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands.

However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |

At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |

Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</p></details> |  |

These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks.

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 tables</p></details> |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |

Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Clustering Functional Trajectories over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11358v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional concurrent, or varying-coefficient, regression models are commonly used in biomedical and clinical settings to investigate how the relation between an outcome and observed covariate varies as a function of another covariate. In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |
| **[Dreamer XL: Towards High-Resolution Text-to-3D Generation via Trajectory Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11252v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Maritime Trajectory Forecasting via H3 Index and Causal Language Modelling (CLM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09596v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of ship trajectories is a growing field of study in artificial intelligence. Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |

In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Proceedings of the 27th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Emotional Trajectories in Written Stories Utilizing Transformers and Weakly-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02251v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telling stories is an integral part of human communication which can evoke emotions and influence the affective states of the audience. Automatically modeling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal labels for an existing dataset of children's stories originally annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the categorical labels to the continuous valence and arousal space. For predicting the thus obtained emotionality signals, we fine-tune a DeBERTa model and improve upon this baseline via a weakly supervised learning approach. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of $.8221$ for valence and $.7125$ for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach. A detailed analysis shows the extent to which the results vary depending on factors such as the author, the individual story, or the section within the story. In addition, we uncover the weaknesses of our approach by investigating examples that prove to be difficult to predict.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Findings. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.11382</p></details> |
| **[Unveiling the Cycloid Trajectory of EM Iterations in Mixed Linear Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18237v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the trajectory of iterations and the convergence rates of the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for two-component Mixed Linear Regression (2MLR). The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</p></details> |  |

First, we use the blocking technique to show that RCPS attains performance guarantees similar to those enjoyed in the iid setting whenever data is generated by asymptotically stationary and contractive dynamics. Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity. We conclude by discussing how these tools could be used toward a unified analysis of online and offline conformal prediction algorithms, which are currently treated with very different tools.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In this work, we investigate cognitive radio networks (CRNs) by jointly designing three-dimensional (3D) trajectory, the transmit power of the UAV, and user scheduling. Considering the UAV's onboard energy consumption, an optimization problem is formulated in which the average achievable rate of the considered system is maximized by jointly optimizing the UAV's 3D trajectory, transmission power, and user scheduling. Due to the non-convex optimization problem, a lower bound on the average achievable rate is utilized to reduce the complexity of the solution. Subsequently, the original optimization problem is decoupled into four subproblems by using block coordinate descent, and each subproblem is transformed into manageable convex optimization problems by introducing slack variables and successive convex approximation. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm and demonstrate that the 3D trajectories of UAVs can enhance the average achievable rate of aerial CRNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures,submitted to the IEEE journal for review</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v2)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

However, diffusion models with neural networks inevitably make prediction errors, which leads to constraint violations such as unmet goals or collisions. This paper presents a novel constraint-aware diffusion model for trajectory optimization. We introduce a novel hybrid loss function for training that minimizes the constraint violation of diffusion samples compared to the groundtruth while recovering the original data distribution. Our model is demonstrated on tabletop manipulation and two-car reach-avoid problems, outperforming traditional diffusion models in minimizing constraint violations while generating samples close to locally optimal solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CCF: Cross Correcting Framework for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00749v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately predicting future pedestrian trajectories is crucial across various domains. Due to the uncertainty in future pedestrian trajectories, it is important to learn complex spatio-temporal representations in multi-agent scenarios. To address this, we propose a novel Cross-Correction Framework (CCF) to learn spatio-temporal representations of pedestrian trajectories better. Our framework consists of two trajectory prediction models, known as subnets, which share the same architecture and are trained with both cross-correction loss and trajectory prediction loss. Cross-correction leverages the learning from both subnets and enables them to refine their underlying representations of trajectories through a mutual correction mechanism. Specifically, we use the cross-correction loss to learn how to correct each other through an inter-subnet interaction. To induce diverse learning among the subnets, we use the transformed observed trajectories produced by a neural network as input to one subnet and the original observed trajectories as input to the other subnet. We utilize transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture for each subnet to capture motion and social interaction among pedestrians. The encoder of the transformer captures motion patterns in trajectories, while the decoder focuses on pedestrian interactions with neighbors. Each subnet performs the primary task of predicting future trajectories (a regression task) along with the secondary task of classifying the predicted trajectories (a classification task). Extensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets such as ETH-UCY and SDD demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed framework, CCF, in precisely predicting pedestrian future trajectories. We also conducted several ablation experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of various modules and loss functions used in our approach.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[MINER-RRT*: A Hierarchical and Fast Trajectory Planning Framework in 3D Cluttered Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00706v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for quadrotors in cluttered environments has been challenging in recent years. While many trajectory planning frameworks have been successful, there still exists potential for improvements, particularly in enhancing the speed of generating efficient trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical trajectory planning framework to reduce computational time and memory usage called MINER-RRT*, which consists of two main components. First, we propose a sampling-based path planning method boosted by neural networks, where the predicted heuristic region accelerates the convergence of rapidly-exploring random trees. Second, we utilize the optimal conditions derived from the quadrotor's differential flatness properties to construct polynomial trajectories that minimize control effort in multiple stages. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our method can generate high-quality trajectories with better performance in 3D cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient Trajectory Generation for Bi-copter Flight in Tight Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00671v1)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike squared (or alike) quadrotors, elongated bi-copters leverage natural superiority in crossing tight spaces. To date, extensive works have focused on the design, modeling, and control of bi-copters. Besides, a proper motion planner utilizing bi-copters' shape characteristics is essential to efficiently and safely traverse tight spaces, yet it has rarely been studied. Current motion planning methods will significantly compromise their ability to traverse narrow spaces if the map is inflated based on the long dimension of the bi-copter. In this paper, we propose an efficient motion planning method that enables the safe navigation of bi-copters through narrow spaces. We first adapt a dynamic, feasible path-finding algorithm with whole-body collision checks to generate a collision-free path. Subsequently, we jointly optimize the position and rotation of the bi-copter to produce a trajectory that is safe, dynamically feasible, and smooth. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments have been conducted to verify the reliability and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 8 pages,8 figures |
| **[Learning to Approximate Particle Smoothing Trajectories via Diffusion Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00561v1)** | 2024-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning dynamical systems from sparse observations is critical in numerous fields, including biology, finance, and physics. Even if tackling such problems is standard in general information fusion, it remains challenging for contemporary machine learning models, such as diffusion models. We introduce a method that integrates conditional particle filtering with ancestral sampling and diffusion models, enabling the generation of realistic trajectories that align with observed data. Our approach uses a smoother based on iterating a conditional particle filter with ancestral sampling to first generate plausible trajectories matching observed marginals, and learns the corresponding diffusion model. This approach provides both a generative method for high-quality, smoothed trajectories under complex constraints, and an efficient approximation of the particle smoothing distribution for classical tracking problems. We demonstrate the approach in time-series generation and interpolation tasks, including vehicle tracking and single-cell RNA sequencing data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Stabilize Unknown LTI Systems on a Single Trajectory under Stochastic Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00234v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning to stabilize unknown noisy Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems on a single trajectory. It is well known in the literature that the learn-to-stabilize problem suffers from exponential blow-up in which the state norm blows up in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ where $n$ is the state space dimension. This blow-up is due to the open-loop instability when exploring the $n$-dimensional state space. To address this issue, we develop a novel algorithm that decouples the unstable subspace of the LTI system from the stable subspace, based on which the algorithm only explores and stabilizes the unstable subspace, the dimension of which can be much smaller than $n$. With a new singular-value-decomposition(SVD)-based analytical framework, we prove that the system is stabilized before the state norm reaches $2^{O(k \log n)}$, where $k$ is the dimension of the unstable subspace. Critically, this bound avoids exponential blow-up in state dimension in the order of $\Theta(2^n)$ as in the previous works, and to the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to avoid exponential blow-up in dimension for stabilizing LTI systems with noise.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-objective variants of LSO struggle with poor initialization, local optima entrapment, and slow adaptation to dynamic environments. This study proposes a Dynamic Multi-Objective Lion Swarm Optimization with Multi-strategy Fusion (MF-DMOLSO) to overcome these challenges. MF-DMOLSO includes an initialization unit using chaotic mapping, a position update unit enhancing behavior patterns based on non-domination and diversity, and an external archive update unit. Evaluations on benchmark functions showed MF-DMOLSO outperformed existing algorithms achieving an accuracy that exceeds the comparison algorithm by 90%. Applied to 6R robot trajectory planning, MF-DMOLSO optimized running time and maximum acceleration to 8.3s and 0.3pi rad/s^2, respectively, achieving a set coverage rate of 70.97% compared to 2% by multi-objective particle swarm optimization, thus improving efficiency and reducing mechanical dither.</p></details> |  |

Due to the intractable growth of non-convex constraints with the number of agents, exploring various homotopy classes that imply different convex domains, is crucial for finding a feasible solution. However, existing methods struggle to explore various homotopy classes efficiently due to combining it with time-consuming precise trajectory solution finding. CSDO, addresses this limitation by separating them into different levels and integrating an efficient Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) algorithm to search homotopy classes. It first searches for a coarse initial guess using a large search step, identifying a specific homotopy class. Subsequent decentralized Quadratic Programming (QP) refinement processes this guess, resolving minor collisions efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate that CSDO outperforms existing MVTP algorithms in large-scale, high-density scenarios, achieving up to 95% success rate in 50m $\times$ 50m random scenarios around one second.

| **[Trajectory Forecasting through Low-Rank Adaptation of Discrete Latent Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20743v1)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory forecasting is crucial for video surveillance analytics, as it enables the anticipation of future movements for a set of agents, e.g. basketball players engaged in intricate interactions with long-term intentions. Deep generative models offer a natural learning approach for trajectory forecasting, yet they encounter difficulties in achieving an optimal balance between sampling fidelity and diversity. We address this challenge by leveraging Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAEs), which utilize a discrete latent space to tackle the issue of posterior collapse. Specifically, we introduce an instance-based codebook that allows tailored latent representations for each example. In a nutshell, the rows of the codebook are dynamically adjusted to reflect contextual information (i.e., past motion patterns extracted from the observed trajectories). In this way, the discretization process gains flexibility, leading to improved reconstructions. Notably, instance-level dynamics are injected into the codebook through low-rank updates, which restrict the customization of the codebook to a lower dimension space. The resulting discrete space serves as the basis of the subsequent step, which regards the training of a diffusion-based predictive model. We show that such a two-fold framework, augmented with instance-level discretization, leads to accurate and diverse forecasts, yielding state-of-the-art performance on three established benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Structure-Aware Lane Graph Transformer Model for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20121v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories for surrounding vehicles is vital for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles. This study proposes a Lane Graph Transformer (LGT) model with structure-aware capabilities. Its key contribution lies in encoding the map topology structure into the attention mechanism. To address variations in lane information from different directions, four Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) matrices are introduced to capture the local details of the map topology structure. Additionally, two Shortest Path Distance (SPD) matrices are employed to capture distance information between two accessible lanes. Numerical results indicate that the proposed LGT model achieves a significantly higher prediction performance on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Specifically, the minFDE$_6$ metric was decreased by 60.73% compared to the Argoverse 2 baseline model (Nearest Neighbor) and the b-minFDE$_6$ metric was reduced by 2.65% compared to the baseline LaneGCN model. Furthermore, ablation experiments demonstrated that the consideration of map topology structure led to a 4.24% drop in the b-minFDE$_6$ metric, validating the effectiveness of this model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Human Mobility: Inferring Semantics of Trajectories with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19850v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human mobility patterns is essential for various applications, from urban planning to public safety. The individual trajectory such as mobile phone location data, while rich in spatio-temporal information, often lacks semantic detail, limiting its utility for in-depth mobility analysis. Existing methods can infer basic routine activity sequences from this data, lacking depth in understanding complex human behaviors and users' characteristics. Additionally, they struggle with the dependency on hard-to-obtain auxiliary datasets like travel surveys. To address these limitations, this paper defines trajectory semantic inference through three key dimensions: user occupation category, activity sequence, and trajectory description, and proposes the Trajectory Semantic Inference with Large Language Models (TSI-LLM) framework to leverage LLMs infer trajectory semantics comprehensively and deeply. We adopt spatio-temporal attributes enhanced data formatting (STFormat) and design a context-inclusive prompt, enabling LLMs to more effectively interpret and infer the semantics of trajectory data. Experimental validation on real-world trajectory datasets demonstrates the efficacy of TSI-LLM in deciphering complex human mobility patterns. This study explores the potential of LLMs in enhancing the semantic analysis of trajectory data, paving the way for more sophisticated and accessible human mobility research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v1)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on three real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively. The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory inference deals with the challenge of reconstructing continuous processes from such observations. In this work, we propose methods for B-spline approximation and interpolation of point clouds through consecutive averaging that is instrinsic to the Wasserstein space. Combining subdivision schemes with optimal transport-based geodesic, our methods carry out trajectory inference at a chosen level of precision and smoothness, and can automatically handle scenarios where particles undergo division over time. We rigorously evaluate our method by providing convergence guarantees and testing it on simulated cell data characterized by bifurcations and merges, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art trajectory inference and interpolation methods. The results not only underscore the effectiveness of our method in inferring trajectories, but also highlight the benefit of performing interpolation and approximation that respect the inherent geometric properties of the data.</p></details> |  |

Projecting Autonomous System Trajectories Into Naturalistic Behavior Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19292v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents operating around human actors must consider how their behaviors might affect those humans, even when not directly interacting with them. To this end, it is often beneficial to be predictable and appear naturalistic. Existing methods to address this problem use human actor intent modeling or imitation learning techniques, but these approaches rarely capture all possible motivations for human behavior or require significant amounts of data. In contrast, we propose a technique for modeling naturalistic behavior as a set of convex hulls computed over a relatively small dataset of human behavior. Given this set, we design an optimization-based filter which projects arbitrary trajectories into it to make them more naturalistic for autonomous agents to execute while also satisfying dynamics constraints. We demonstrate our methods on real-world human driving data from the inD intersection dataset (Bock et al., 2020).</p></details> |  |

Moreover, weather and time-of-day may affect pedestrian behavior. In this paper, a new weather-time-trajectory fusion network (WTTFNet) is proposed to improve the performance of baseline deep neural network architecture. By incorporating weather and time-of-day information as an embedding structure, a novel WTTFNet based on gate multimodal unit is used to fuse the multimodal information and deep representation of trajectories. A joint loss function based on focal loss is used to co-optimize both the deep trajectory features and final classifier, which helps to improve the accuracy in predicting the intended destination of pedestrians and hence the trajectories under possible scenarios of class imbalances. Experimental results using the Osaka Asia and Pacific Trade Center (ATC) dataset shows improved performance of the proposed approach over state-of-the-art algorithms by 23.67% increase in classification accuracy, 9.16% and 7.07% reduction of average and final displacement error. The proposed approach may serve as an attractive approach for improving existing baseline trajectory prediction models when they are applied to scenarios with influences of weather-time conditions. It can be employed in numerous applications such as pedestrian facility engineering, public space development and technology-driven retail.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

This paper addresses the near danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off the common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models and ensure safety, but doing so introduces numerical approximation error conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach avoid methods in near-danger goal reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings.

| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |

The conventional approach involves analyzing agent movements through three primary tasks: trajectory prediction, imputation, and spatial-temporal recovery. Considering the unique input formulation and constraint of these tasks, most existing methods are tailored to address only one specific task. However, in real-world applications, these scenarios frequently occur simultaneously. Consequently, methods designed for one task often fail to adapt to others, resulting in performance drops. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Unified Trajectory Generation model, UniTraj, that processes arbitrary trajectories as masked inputs, adaptable to diverse scenarios. Specifically, we introduce a Ghost Spatial Masking (GSM) module embedded within a Transformer encoder for spatial feature extraction. We further extend recent successful State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba model, into a Bidirectional Temporal Mamba to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Additionally, we incorporate a Bidirectional Temporal Scaled (BTS) module to comprehensively scan trajectories while maintaining the temporal missing relationships within the sequence. We curate and benchmark three practical sports game datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, for evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that addresses this unified problem through a versatile generative framework, thereby enhancing our understanding of multi-agent movement.

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames. The code of this paper will also be open-sourced at: https://github.com/wsakobe/EF-Calib.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and Laformer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

This pattern is also often observed within-seasons as athlete aims for their performance to peak at key events such as the Olympic Games or World Championships. A Bayesian hierarchical model is developed to analyse the evolution of athletic sporting performance throughout an athlete's career and separate these effects whilst allowing for confounding factors such as environmental conditions. Our model works in continuous time and estimates both the average performance level of the population, $g(t)$, at age $t$ and how each $i$-th athlete differs from the average $f_i(t)$. We further decompose $f_i(t)$ into changes from season-to-season, termed the between-season performance trajectory, and within-season performance trajectories which are modelled by a constrained Bernstein polynomial. Hence, the specific focus of this project is to identify the differences in performance that exist both between and within-seasons for each athlete. For the implementation of the model an adaptive Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm is used. An illustration of algorithm's performance on 100 metres and 200 metres freestyle swimming in both female and male athletes is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Data Suffices for Statistically Efficient Learning in Offline RL with Linear $q^π$-Realizability and Concentrability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16809v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider offline reinforcement learning (RL) in $H$-horizon Markov decision processes (MDPs) under the linear $q^\pi$-realizability assumption, where the action-value function of every policy is linear with respect to a given $d$-dimensional feature function. The hope in this setting is that learning a good policy will be possible without requiring a sample size that scales with the number of states in the MDP. Foster et al. [2021] have shown this to be impossible even under $\textit{concentrability}$, a data coverage assumption where a coefficient $C_\text{conc}$ bounds the extent to which the state-action distribution of any policy can veer off the data distribution. However, the data in this previous work was in the form of a sequence of individual transitions. This leaves open the question of whether the negative result mentioned could be overcome if the data was composed of sequences of full trajectories. In this work we answer this question positively by proving that with trajectory data, a dataset of size $\text{poly}(d,H,C_\text{conc})/\epsilon^2$ is sufficient for deriving an $\epsilon$-optimal policy, regardless of the size of the state space. The main tool that makes this result possible is due to Weisz et al. [2023], who demonstrate that linear MDPs can be used to approximate linearly $q^\pi$-realizable MDPs. The connection to trajectory data is that the linear MDP approximation relies on "skipping" over certain states. The associated estimation problems are thus easy when working with trajectory data, while they remain nontrivial when working with individual transitions. The question of computational efficiency under our assumptions remains open.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v3)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |

We utilize OpenCV's CSRT algorithm to accurately track the baseball and fixed reference points in 2D video frames. These tracked pixel coordinates are then used as input features for our neural network model, which comprises multiple fully connected layers to map the 2D coordinates to 3D space. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled trajectories using a mean squared error loss function and the Adam optimizer, optimizing the network to minimize prediction errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach achieves high accuracy in reconstructing 3D trajectories from 2D inputs. This method shows great potential for applications in sports analysis, coaching, and enhancing the accuracy of trajectory predictions in various sports.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlightPatchNet: Multi-Scale Patch Network with Differential Coding for Flight Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16200v1)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate multi-step flight trajectory prediction plays an important role in Air Traffic Control, which can ensure the safety of air transportation. Two main issues limit the flight trajectory prediction performance of existing works. The first issue is the negative impact on prediction accuracy caused by the significant differences in data range. The second issue is that real-world flight trajectories involve underlying temporal dependencies, and existing methods fail to reveal the hidden complex temporal variations and only extract features from one single time scale. To address the above issues, we propose FlightPatchNet, a multi-scale patch network with differential coding for flight trajectory prediction. Specifically, FlightPatchNet first utilizes the differential coding to encode the original values of longitude and latitude into first-order differences and generates embeddings for all variables at each time step. Then, a global temporal attention is introduced to explore the dependencies between different time steps. To fully explore the diverse temporal patterns in flight trajectories, a multi-scale patch network is delicately designed to serve as the backbone. The multi-scale patch network exploits stacked patch mixer blocks to capture inter- and intra-patch dependencies under different time scales, and further integrates multi-scale temporal features across different scales and variables. Finally, FlightPatchNet ensembles multiple predictors to make direct multi-step prediction. Extensive experiments on ADS-B datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms the competitive baselines.

| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v2)** | 2024-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of Flow Matching (FM) methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the Optimal Transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for the fast integration (inference) of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative FM procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristics based on minibatch OT. To address these issues, we develop and theoretically justify the novel Optimal Flow Matching approach which allows recovering the straight OT displacement for the quadratic transport in just one FM step. The main idea of our approach is the employment of vector field for FM which are parameterized by convex functions.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of trajectory data in terms of volume, density, and inter-person interactions, limits relevant studies from being comprehensive and interactive. We mine millions of biography pages from Wikipedia and tackle the generalization problem stemming from the variety and heterogeneity of the trajectory descriptions.

Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands.

However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |

At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |

Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</p></details> |  |

These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 tables</p></details> |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |

Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Clustering Functional Trajectories over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11358v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional concurrent, or varying-coefficient, regression models are commonly used in biomedical and clinical settings to investigate how the relation between an outcome and observed covariate varies as a function of another covariate. In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |
| **[Dreamer XL: Towards High-Resolution Text-to-3D Generation via Trajectory Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11252v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Critical to these improvements is understanding AVs' longitudinal behavior, relying heavily on real-world trajectory data. Existing open-source trajectory datasets of AV, however, often fall short in refinement, reliability, and completeness, hindering effective performance metrics analysis and model development. This study addresses these challenges by creating a Unified Longitudinal TRAjectory dataset for AVs (Ultra-AV) to analyze their microscopic longitudinal driving behaviors. This dataset compiles data from 13 distinct sources, encompassing various AV types, test sites, and experiment scenarios. We established a three-step data processing: 1. extraction of longitudinal trajectory data, 2. general data cleaning, and 3. data-specific cleaning to obtain the longitudinal trajectory data and car-following trajectory data. The validity of the processed data is affirmed through performance evaluations across safety, mobility, stability, and sustainability, along with an analysis of the relationships between variables in car-following models. Our work not only furnishes researchers with standardized data and metrics for longitudinal AV behavior studies but also sets guidelines for data collection and model development.</p></details> | NA |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |

However, they exhibit position bias, also known as "lost in the middle", a phenomenon that is especially pronounced in long-context scenarios, which indicates the placement of the key information in different positions of a prompt can significantly affect accuracy. This paper first explores the micro-level manifestations of position bias, concluding that attention weights are a micro-level expression of position bias. It further identifies that, in addition to position embeddings, causal attention mask also contributes to position bias by creating position-specific hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose a method to mitigate position bias by scaling this positional hidden states. Experiments on the NaturalQuestions Multi-document QA, KV retrieval, LongBench and timeline reorder tasks, using various models including RoPE models, context windowextended models, and Alibi models, demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach. Our method can improve performance by up to 15.2% by modifying just one dimension of hidden states. Our code is available at https://aka.ms/PositionalHidden.</p></details> |  |

In Robotics, scaling is hindered by the lack of access to massive robot datasets. We advocate using realistic physical simulation as a means to scale environments, tasks, and datasets for robot learning methods. We present RoboCasa, a large-scale simulation framework for training generalist robots in everyday environments. RoboCasa features realistic and diverse scenes focusing on kitchen environments. We provide thousands of 3D assets across over 150 object categories and dozens of interactable furniture and appliances. We enrich the realism and diversity of our simulation with generative AI tools, such as object assets from text-to-3D models and environment textures from text-to-image models. We design a set of 100 tasks for systematic evaluation, including composite tasks generated by the guidance of large language models. To facilitate learning, we provide high-quality human demonstrations and integrate automated trajectory generation methods to substantially enlarge our datasets with minimal human burden.

| **[Large Language Models Spot Phishing Emails with Surprising Accuracy: A Comparative Analysis of Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15485v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phishing, a prevalent cybercrime tactic for decades, remains a significant threat in today's digital world. By leveraging clever social engineering elements and modern technology, cybercrime targets many individuals, businesses, and organizations to exploit trust and security. These cyber-attackers are often disguised in many trustworthy forms to appear as legitimate sources. By cleverly using psychological elements like urgency, fear, social proof, and other manipulative strategies, phishers can lure individuals into revealing sensitive and personalized information. Building on this pervasive issue within modern technology, this paper aims to analyze the effectiveness of 15 Large Language Models (LLMs) in detecting phishing attempts, specifically focusing on a randomized set of "419 Scam" emails. The objective is to determine which LLMs can accurately detect phishing emails by analyzing a text file containing email metadata based on predefined criteria. The experiment concluded that the following models, ChatGPT 3.5, GPT-3.5-Turbo-Instruct, and ChatGPT, were the most effective in detecting phishing emails.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

VideoPoet employs a decoder-only transformer architecture that processes multimodal inputs -- including images, videos, text, and audio. The training protocol follows that of Large Language Models (LLMs), consisting of two stages: pretraining and task-specific adaptation. During pretraining, VideoPoet incorporates a mixture of multimodal generative objectives within an autoregressive Transformer framework. The pretrained LLM serves as a foundation that can be adapted for a range of video generation tasks.

| **[Unlocking Efficiency in Large Language Model Inference: A Comprehensive Survey of Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07851v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate the high inference latency stemming from autoregressive decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs), Speculative Decoding has emerged as a novel decoding paradigm for LLM inference. In each decoding step, this method first drafts several future tokens efficiently and then verifies them in parallel. Unlike autoregressive decoding, Speculative Decoding facilitates the simultaneous decoding of multiple tokens per step, thereby accelerating inference. This paper presents a comprehensive overview and analysis of this promising decoding paradigm. We begin by providing a formal definition and formulation of Speculative Decoding. Then, we organize in-depth discussions on its key facets, such as drafter selection and verification strategies. Furthermore, we present a comparative analysis of leading methods under third-party testing environments. We aim for this work to serve as a catalyst for further research on Speculative Decoding, ultimately contributing to more efficient LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 Findings (Long Paper), camera-ready version</p></details> |
| **[Hiding Text in Large Language Models: Introducing Unconditional Token Forcing Confusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02481v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the help of simple fine-tuning, one can artificially embed hidden text into large language models (LLMs). This text is revealed only when triggered by a specific query to the LLM. Two primary applications are LLM fingerprinting and steganography. In the context of LLM fingerprinting, a unique text identifier (fingerprint) is embedded within the model to verify licensing compliance. In the context of steganography, the LLM serves as a carrier for hidden messages that can be disclosed through a designated trigger. Our work demonstrates that embedding hidden text in the LLM via fine-tuning, though seemingly secure due to the vast number of potential triggers (any sequence of characters or tokens could serve as a trigger), is susceptible to extraction through analysis of the LLM's output decoding process. We propose a novel approach to extraction called Unconditional Token Forcing. It is premised on the hypothesis that iteratively feeding each token from the LLM's vocabulary into the model should reveal sequences with abnormally high token probabilities, indicating potential embedded text candidates. Additionally, our experiments show that when the first token of a hidden fingerprint is used as an input, the LLM not only produces an output sequence with high token probabilities, but also repetitively generates the fingerprint itself. We also present a method to hide text in such a way that it is resistant to Unconditional Token Forcing, which we named Unconditional Token Forcing Confusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

A Benchmark towards Temporal, Long Context Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02472v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The digital landscape is rapidly evolving with an ever-increasing volume of online news, emphasizing the need for swift and precise analysis of complex events. We refer to the complex events composed of many news articles over an extended period as Temporal Complex Event (TCE). This paper proposes a novel approach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically extract and analyze the event chain within TCE, characterized by their key points and timestamps. We establish a benchmark, named TCELongBench, to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs in handling temporal dynamics and understanding extensive text. This benchmark encompasses three distinct tasks - reading comprehension, temporal sequencing, and future event forecasting. In the experiment, we leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method and LLMs with long context window to deal with lengthy news articles of TCE. Our findings indicate that models with suitable retrievers exhibit comparable performance with those utilizing long context window.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |
| **[LLMCRIT: Teaching Large Language Models to Use Criteria](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01069v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans follow criteria when they execute tasks, and these criteria are directly used to assess the quality of task completion. Therefore, having models learn to use criteria to provide feedback can help humans or models to perform tasks better. However, existing research in this field tends to consider only a limited set of criteria or quality assessment aspects. To fill this gap, we propose a general framework that enables large language models (LLMs) to use comprehensive criteria for a task in delivering natural language feedback on task execution. In particular, we present a model-in-the-loop framework that semi-automatically derives criteria from collected guidelines for different writing tasks and constructs in-context demonstrations for each criterion. We choose three tasks from real-world scenarios to operationalize this idea: paper introduction writing, Python code writing, and Reddit post writing, and evaluate our feedback generation framework using different LLMs. The results reveal the fine-grained effects of incorporating criteria and demonstrations and provide valuable insights on how to teach LLMs to use criteria more effectively.</p></details> | ACL 2024 findings |

Though surprised by their excellent performances, researchers also noticed some special behaviors of those LLMs. One of those behaviors is memorization, in which LLMs can generate the same content used to train them. Though previous research has discussed memorization, the memorization of LLMs still lacks explanation, especially the cause of memorization and the dynamics of generating them. In this research, we comprehensively discussed memorization from various perspectives and extended the discussion scope to not only just the memorized content but also less and unmemorized content. Through various studies, we found that: (1) Through experiments, we revealed the relation of memorization between model size, continuation size, and context size. Further, we showed how unmemorized sentences transition to memorized sentences. (2) Through embedding analysis, we showed the distribution and decoding dynamics across model size in embedding space for sentences with different memorization scores. The n-gram statistics analysis presents d (3) An analysis over n-gram and entropy decoding dynamics discovered a boundary effect when the model starts to generate memorized sentences or unmemorized sentences. (4)We trained a Transformer model to predict the memorization of different models, showing that it is possible to predict memorizations by context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Choice Questions and Large Languages Models: A Case Study with Fictional Medical Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02394v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT demonstrate significant potential in the medical field, often evaluated using multiple-choice questions (MCQs) similar to those found on the USMLE. Despite their prevalence in medical education, MCQs have limitations that might be exacerbated when assessing LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of MCQs in assessing the performance of LLMs, we developed a fictional medical benchmark focused on a non-existent gland, the Glianorex. This approach allowed us to isolate the knowledge of the LLM from its test-taking abilities. We used GPT-4 to generate a comprehensive textbook on the Glianorex in both English and French and developed corresponding multiple-choice questions in both languages. We evaluated various open-source, proprietary, and domain-specific LLMs using these questions in a zero-shot setting. The models achieved average scores around 67%, with minor performance differences between larger and smaller models. Performance was slightly higher in English than in French. Fine-tuned medical models showed some improvement over their base versions in English but not in French. The uniformly high performance across models suggests that traditional MCQ-based benchmarks may not accurately measure LLMs' clinical knowledge and reasoning abilities, instead highlighting their pattern recognition skills. This study underscores the need for more robust evaluation methods to better assess the true capabilities of LLMs in medical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Various goals can be achieved with the proposed framework, such as improving the readability of the diarized transcript, or reducing the word diarization error rate (WDER). In this framework, the outputs of the automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker diarization systems are represented as a compact textual format, which is included in the prompt to an optionally finetuned LLM. The outputs of the LLM can be used as the refined diarization results with the desired enhancement. As a post-processing step, this framework can be easily applied to any off-the-shelf ASR and speaker diarization systems without retraining existing components. Our experiments show that a finetuned PaLM 2-S model can reduce the WDER by rel. 55.5% on the Fisher telephone conversation dataset, and rel. 44.9% on the Callhome English dataset.</p></details> |  |

Collaborative Filtering (CF) is a widely adopted approach, but while advanced techniques like graph neural networks (GNNs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) have enhanced CF models for better user representations, they often lack the ability to provide explanations for the recommended items. Explainable recommendations aim to address this gap by offering transparency and insights into the recommendation decision-making process, enhancing users' understanding. This work leverages the language capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to push the boundaries of explainable recommender systems. We introduce a model-agnostic framework called XRec, which enables LLMs to provide comprehensive explanations for user behaviors in recommender systems. By integrating collaborative signals and designing a lightweight collaborative adaptor, the framework empowers LLMs to understand complex patterns in user-item interactions and gain a deeper understanding of user preferences. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of XRec, showcasing its ability to generate comprehensive and meaningful explanations that outperform baseline approaches in explainable recommender systems.

We discover that LLM's performance exceeds humans and surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods fine-tuned on extensive datasets in debate evaluation. We additionally explore and analyze biases present in LLMs, including positional bias, lexical bias, order bias, which may affect their evaluative judgments. Our findings reveal a consistent bias in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 towards the second candidate response presented, attributed to prompt design. We also uncover lexical biases in both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, especially when label sets carry connotations such as numerical or sequential, highlighting the critical need for careful label verbalizer selection in prompt design. Additionally, our analysis indicates a tendency of both models to favor the debate's concluding side as the winner, suggesting an end-of-discussion bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 main</p></details> |

Our constructed benchmark dataset is focused on four facets of writing proficiency and six facets of safety adherence, and it comprises manually and carefully designed 1,267 test samples in the types of multiple choice questions and short answer questions for five editorial tasks in 24 news domains. To measure performances, we propose different GPT-4 based automatic evaluation protocols to assess LLM generations for short answer questions in terms of writing proficiency and safety adherence, and both are validated by the high correlations with human evaluations. Based on the systematic evaluation framework, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of ten popular LLMs which can handle Chinese. The experimental results highlight GPT-4 and ERNIE Bot as top performers, yet reveal a relative deficiency in journalistic safety adherence in creative writing tasks. Our findings also underscore the need for enhanced ethical guidance in machine-generated journalistic content, marking a step forward in aligning LLMs with journalistic standards and safety considerations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Long ...</summary><p>Long paper, ACL 2024 Main</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models Make Sample-Efficient Recommender Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02368v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in the field of natural language processing (NLP), demonstrating remarkable abilities in producing text that resembles human language for various tasks. This opens up new opportunities for employing them in recommender systems (RSs). In this paper, we specifically examine the sample efficiency of LLM-enhanced recommender systems, which pertains to the model's capacity to attain superior performance with a limited quantity of training data. Conventional recommendation models (CRMs) often need a large amount of training data because of the sparsity of features and interactions. Hence, we propose and verify our core viewpoint: Large Language Models Make Sample-Efficient Recommender Systems. We propose a simple yet effective framework (i.e., Laser) to validate the viewpoint from two aspects: (1) LLMs themselves are sample-efficient recommenders; and (2) LLMs, as feature generators and encoders, make CRMs more sample-efficient. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that Laser requires only a small fraction of training samples to match or even surpass CRMs that are trained on the entire training set, demonstrating superior sample efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Frontier of Computer Science</p></details> |
| **[Editing Factual Knowledge and Explanatory Ability of Medical Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18099v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model editing aims to precisely alter the behaviors of large language models (LLMs) in relation to specific knowledge, while leaving unrelated knowledge intact. This approach has proven effective in addressing issues of hallucination and outdated information in LLMs. However, the potential of using model editing to modify knowledge in the medical field remains largely unexplored, even though resolving hallucination is a pressing need in this area. Our observations indicate that current methods face significant challenges in dealing with specialized and complex knowledge in medical domain. Therefore, we propose MedLaSA, a novel Layer-wise Scalable Adapter strategy for medical model editing. MedLaSA harnesses the strengths of both adding extra parameters and locate-then-edit methods for medical model editing. We utilize causal tracing to identify the association of knowledge in neurons across different layers, and generate a corresponding scale set from the association value for each piece of knowledge. Subsequently, we incorporate scalable adapters into the dense layers of LLMs. These adapters are assigned scaling values based on the corresponding specific knowledge, which allows for the adjustment of the adapter's weight and rank. The more similar the content, the more consistent the scale between them. This ensures precise editing of semantically identical knowledge while avoiding impact on unrelated knowledge. To evaluate the editing impact on the behaviours of LLMs, we propose two model editing studies for medical domain: (1) editing factual knowledge for medical specialization and (2) editing the explanatory ability for complex knowledge. We build two novel medical benchmarking datasets and introduce a series of challenging and comprehensive metrics. Extensive experiments on medical LLMs demonstrate the editing efficiency of MedLaSA, without affecting unrelated knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Yet, their effectiveness often diminishes in low-resource languages like Chinese, exacerbated by biased evaluations from data leakage, casting doubt on their true generalizability to new linguistic territories. In response, we introduce the Chinese Instruction-Following Benchmark (CIF-Bench), designed to evaluate the zero-shot generalizability of LLMs to the Chinese language. CIF-Bench comprises 150 tasks and 15,000 input-output pairs, developed by native speakers to test complex reasoning and Chinese cultural nuances across 20 categories. To mitigate data contamination, we release only half of the dataset publicly, with the remainder kept private, and introduce diversified instructions to minimize score variance, totaling 45,000 data instances. Our evaluation of 28 selected LLMs reveals a noticeable performance gap, with the best model scoring only 52.9%, highlighting the limitations of LLMs in less familiar language and task contexts. This work not only uncovers the current limitations of LLMs in handling Chinese language tasks but also sets a new standard for future LLM generalizability research, pushing towards the development of more adaptable, culturally informed, and linguistically diverse models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ACL 2024.

However, when it comes to domain-specific knowledge and downstream tasks like medical, general LLMs are often unable to give precise answers. In addition, when people want LLMs to answer classification questions, they usually go through instruction tuning first, however, LLMs do not always give a direct index of the categorization after instruction tuning. In this paper, we proposed LlamaCare, a fine-tuned medical language model, and Extended Classification Integration(ECI), a module to handle classification problems of LLMs. Our contributions are : (i) We fine-tuned a large language model of medical knowledge with very low carbon emissions and achieved similar performance with ChatGPT by a 24G GPU. (ii) We solved the problem of redundant categorical answers and improved the performance of LLMs by proposing a new module called Extended Classification Integration. (iii) We released our processed data for one-shot and few-shot training for some benchmarks such as PubMedQA and USMLE 1-3 step. Our method achieves a close effect with the state-of-the-art model in benchmarks while costing lower GPU resources compared to LLMs with the same quantity of parameters.

On the Cross-lingual Consistency of Text Watermark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14007v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text watermarking technology aims to tag and identify content produced by large language models (LLMs) to prevent misuse. In this study, we introduce the concept of cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking, which assesses the ability of text watermarks to maintain their effectiveness after being translated into other languages. Preliminary empirical results from two LLMs and three watermarking methods reveal that current text watermarking technologies lack consistency when texts are translated into various languages. Based on this observation, we propose a Cross-lingual Watermark Removal Attack (CWRA) to bypass watermarking by first obtaining a response from an LLM in a pivot language, which is then translated into the target language. CWRA can effectively remove watermarks, decreasing the AUCs to a random-guessing level without performance loss. Furthermore, we analyze two key factors that contribute to the cross-lingual consistency in text watermarking and propose X-SIR as a defense method against CWRA.

However, fine-tuning these models is a demanding task because the user has to examine several factors, such as resource budget, runtime, model size and context length among others. A specific challenge is that fine-tuning is memory intensive, imposing constraints on the required hardware memory and context length of training data that can be handled. In this work, we share a detailed study on a variety of fine-tuning optimizations across different fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, we assess Gradient Checkpointing, Low Rank Adaptation, DeepSpeed's ZeRO Redundancy Optimizer and Flash Attention. With a focus on memory and runtime, we examine the impact of different optimization combinations on GPU memory usage and execution runtime during fine-tuning phase. We provide recommendation on best default optimization for balancing memory and runtime across diverse model sizes. We share effective strategies for fine-tuning very large models with tens or hundreds of billions of parameters and enabling large context lengths during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we propose the appropriate optimization mixtures for fine-tuning under GPU resource limitations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

However, narrowing the performance gap with supervised systems remains an ongoing challenge. Several studies have observed that speech representations from large-scale ASR models contain valuable speaker information. This work explores the limitations of fine-tuning these models for SV using an SSL contrastive objective in an end-to-end approach. Then, we propose a framework to learn speaker representations in an SSL context by fine-tuning a pre-trained WavLM with a supervised loss using pseudo-labels. Initial pseudo-labels are derived from an SSL DINO-based model and are iteratively refined by clustering the model embeddings. Our method achieves 0.99% EER on VoxCeleb1-O, establishing the new state-of-the-art on self-supervised SV.

However, exploring their capability for generating long-form contents, such as reports and articles, has been relatively unexplored and inadequately assessed by existing benchmarks. The prevalent evaluation methods, which predominantly rely on crowdsourcing, are recognized for their labor-intensive nature and lack of efficiency, whereas automated metrics, such as the ROUGE score, demonstrate discordance with human judgment criteria. In this paper, we propose ProxyQA, an innovative framework dedicated to assessing long-text generation. ProxyQA comprises in-depth human-curated meta-questions spanning various domains, each accompanied by specific proxy-questions with pre-annotated answers. LLMs are tasked to generate extensive content in response to these meta-questions, by engaging an evaluator and incorporating the generated texts as contextual background, ProxyQA assesses the generated content's quality through the evaluator's accuracy in addressing the proxy-questions. We examine multiple LLMs, emphasizing ProxyQA's demanding nature as a high-quality assessment tool. Human evaluation demonstrates that the proxy-question method is notably self-consistent and aligns closely with human evaluative standards.

In this paper we present a pilot study of enhancing translation memories (TM) produced by PE (source segments, machine translations, and reference translations, henceforth called PE-TM) for the needs of correct and consistent term translation in technical domains. We investigate a light-weight two-step scenario where, at inference time, a human translator marks errors in the first translation step, and in a second step a few similar examples are extracted from the PE-TM to prompt an LLM. Our experiment shows that the additional effort of augmenting translations with human error markings guides the LLM to focus on a correction of the marked errors, yielding consistent improvements over automatic PE (APE) and MT from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at The 25th Annual Conference of the European Association for Machine Translation (EAMT 2024)</p></details> |

However, no text-to-MIDI models currently exist, mostly due to the lack of a captioned MIDI dataset. This work aims to enable research that combines LLMs with symbolic music by presenting the first large-scale MIDI dataset with text captions that is openly available: MidiCaps. MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) files are a widely used format for encoding musical information. Their structured format captures the nuances of musical composition and has practical applications by music producers, composers, musicologists, as well as performers. Inspired by recent advancements in captioning techniques applied to various domains, we present a large-scale curated dataset of over 168k MIDI files accompanied by textual descriptions. Each MIDI caption succinctly describes the musical content, encompassing tempo, chord progression, time signature, instruments present, genre and mood; thereby facilitating multi-modal exploration and analysis. The dataset contains a mix of various genres, styles, and complexities, offering a rich source for training and evaluating models for tasks such as music information retrieval, music understanding and cross-modal translation. We provide detailed statistics about the dataset and have assessed the quality of the captions in an extensive listening study. We anticipate that this resource will stimulate further research in the intersection of music and natural language processing, fostering advancements in both fields.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[A Framework for Neurosymbolic Robot Action Planning using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00438v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic task planning is a widely used approach to enforce robot autonomy due to its ease of understanding and deployment in robot architectures. However, techniques for symbolic task planning are difficult to scale in real-world, human-robot collaboration scenarios because of the poor performance in complex planning domains or when frequent re-planning is needed. We present a framework, Teriyaki, specifically aimed at bridging the gap between symbolic task planning and machine learning approaches. The rationale is training Large Language Models (LLMs), namely GPT-3, into a neurosymbolic task planner compatible with the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), and then leveraging its generative capabilities to overcome a number of limitations inherent to symbolic task planners. Potential benefits include (i) a better scalability in so far as the planning domain complexity increases, since LLMs' response time linearly scales with the combined length of the input and the output, and (ii) the ability to synthesize a plan action-by-action instead of end-to-end, making each action available for execution as soon as it is generated instead of waiting for the whole plan to be available, which in turn enables concurrent planning and execution. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted by the research community to evaluate the cognitive capabilities of LLMs, with alternate successes. Instead, with Teriyaki we aim to provide an overall planning performance comparable to traditional planners in specific planning domains, while leveraging LLMs capabilities to build a look-ahead predictive planning model. Preliminary results in selected domains show that our method can: (i) solve 95.5% of problems in a test data set of 1,000 samples; (ii) produce plans up to 13.5% shorter than a traditional symbolic planner; (iii) reduce average overall waiting times for a plan availability by up to 61.4%</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Distortions in Judged Spatial Relations in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04218v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a benchmark for assessing the capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discern intercardinal directions between geographic locations and apply it to three prominent LLMs: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Llama-2. This benchmark specifically evaluates whether LLMs exhibit a hierarchical spatial bias similar to humans, where judgments about individual locations' spatial relationships are influenced by the perceived relationships of the larger groups that contain them. To investigate this, we formulated 14 questions focusing on well-known American cities. Seven questions were designed to challenge the LLMs with scenarios potentially influenced by the orientation of larger geographical units, such as states or countries, while the remaining seven targeted locations were less susceptible to such hierarchical categorization. Among the tested models, GPT-4 exhibited superior performance with 55 percent accuracy, followed by GPT-3.5 at 47 percent, and Llama-2 at 45 percent. The models showed significantly reduced accuracy on tasks with suspected hierarchical bias. For example, GPT-4's accuracy dropped to 33 percent on these tasks, compared to 86 percent on others. However, the models identified the nearest cardinal direction in most cases, reflecting their associative learning mechanism, thereby embodying human-like misconceptions. We discuss avenues for improving the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for publication in The Professional Geographer</p></details> |
| **[Unraveling and Mitigating Retriever Inconsistencies in Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20680v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RALMs) demonstrate their superiority in terms of factuality, they do not consistently outperform the original retrieval-free Language Models (LMs). Our experiments reveal that this example-level performance inconsistency exists not only between retrieval-augmented and retrieval-free LM but also among different retrievers. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate the degeneration behavior of RALMs and theoretically decompose it into four categories. Further analysis based on our decomposition reveals that the innate difference in knowledge sources and the unpredictable degeneration of the reader model contribute most to the inconsistency. Drawing from our analysis, we introduce Ensemble of Retrievers (EoR), a trainable framework that can adaptively retrieve from different knowledge sources and effectively decrease unpredictable reader errors. Our experiments on Open Domain Question Answering show that EoR substantially improves performance over the RALM with a single retriever by considerably reducing inconsistent behaviors.</p></details> | ACL 2024 (findings) |
| **[FedMKT: Federated Mutual Knowledge Transfer for Large and Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02224v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in federated large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused on enabling clients to fine-tune their locally deployed homogeneous LLMs collaboratively or on transferring knowledge from server-based LLMs to small language models (SLMs) at downstream clients. However, a significant gap remains in the simultaneous mutual enhancement of both the server's LLM and clients' SLMs. To bridge this gap, we propose FedMKT, a parameter-efficient federated mutual knowledge transfer framework for large and small language models. This framework is designed to adaptively transfer knowledge from the server's LLM to clients' SLMs while concurrently enriching the LLM with clients' unique domain insights. We facilitate token alignment using minimum edit distance (MinED) and then selective mutual knowledge transfer between client-side SLMs and a server-side LLM, aiming to collectively enhance their performance. Through extensive experiments across three distinct scenarios, heterogeneous, homogeneous, and one-to-one, we evaluate the effectiveness of FedMKT using various public LLMs and SLMs on a range of NLP text generation tasks. Empirical results demonstrate significant performance improvements in clients' SLMs with the aid of the LLM. Furthermore, the LLM optimized by FedMKT achieves a performance comparable to that achieved through direct fine-tuning based on clients' data, highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of FedMKT.</p></details> |  |
| **[KnowGPT: Knowledge Graph based Prompting for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06185v5)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in many real-world applications. Nonetheless, LLMs are often criticized for their tendency to produce hallucinations, wherein the models fabricate incorrect statements on tasks beyond their knowledge and perception. To alleviate this issue, researchers have explored leveraging the factual knowledge in knowledge graphs (KGs) to ground the LLM's responses in established facts and principles. However, most state-of-the-art LLMs are closed-source, making it challenging to develop a prompting framework that can efficiently and effectively integrate KGs into LLMs with hard prompts only. Generally, existing KG-enhanced LLMs usually suffer from three critical issues, including huge search space, high API costs, and laborious prompt engineering, that impede their widespread application in practice. To this end, we introduce a novel Knowledge Graph based PrompTing framework, namely KnowGPT, to enhance LLMs with domain knowledge. KnowGPT contains a knowledge extraction module to extract the most informative knowledge from KGs, and a context-aware prompt construction module to automatically convert extracted knowledge into effective prompts. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that KnowGPT significantly outperforms all competitors. Notably, KnowGPT achieves a 92.6% accuracy on OpenbookQA leaderboard, comparable to human-level performance.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, often reliant on costly and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques, integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated science knowledge graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Mitigating this concern necessitates the deployment and optimization of network energy-saving solutions, such as carrier shutdown, to dynamically manage network resources. Traditional optimization approaches encounter complexity due to factors like the large number of cells, stochastic traffic, channel variations, and intricate trade-offs. This paper introduces the simulated reality of communication networks (SRCON) framework, a novel, data-driven modeling paradigm that harnesses live network data and employs a blend of machine learning (ML)- and expert-based models. These mix of models accurately characterizes the functioning of network components, and predicts network energy efficiency and user equipment (UE) quality of service for any energy carrier shutdown configuration in a specific network. Distinguishing itself from existing methods, SRCON eliminates the reliance on expensive expert knowledge, drive testing, or incomplete maps for predicting network performance. This paper details the pipeline employed by SRCON to decompose the large network energy efficiency modeling problem into ML and expert-based submodels. It demonstrates how, by embracing stochasticity, and carefully crafting the relationship between such submodels, the overall computational complexity can be reduced and prediction accuracy enhanced. Results derived from real network data underscore the paradigm shift introduced by SRCON, showcasing significant gains over a state-of-the art method used by a operator for network energy efficiency modeling. The reliability of this local, data-driven modeling of the network proves to be a key asset for network energy-saving optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 13 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking</p></details> |

Existing approaches utilize fine-tuning of small language models (SLMs) like BERT to address the compatibility among the contexts of event mentions. However, due to the complexity and diversity of contexts, these models are prone to learning simple co-occurrences. Recently, large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have demonstrated impressive contextual understanding, yet they encounter challenges in adapting to specific information extraction (IE) tasks. In this paper, we propose a collaborative approach for CDECR, leveraging the capabilities of both a universally capable LLM and a task-specific SLM. The collaborative strategy begins with the LLM accurately and comprehensively summarizing events through prompting. Then, the SLM refines its learning of event representations based on these insights during fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the performance of both the large and small language models individually, forming a complementary advantage. Across various datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness in diverse scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL-24 Main</p></details> |

To address this issue, we leverage large language models (LLMs) as the foundation annotators for the joint stance detection (SD) and rumor verification (RV) tasks, dubbed as JSDRV. We introduce a novel reinforcement tuning framework to enhance the joint predictive capabilities of LLM-based SD and RV components. Specifically, we devise a policy for selecting LLM-annotated data at the two levels, employing a hybrid reward mechanism to choose high-quality labels for effective LLM fine-tuning on both tasks. Results demonstrate that JSDRV improves the capabilities of LLMs in the joint tasks, not only outperforming state-of-the-art methods but also generalizing to non-LLMs accommodated as task models.</p></details> | ACL 2024 (Findings) |

The effectiveness of LLMs in summarizing radiology report impressions remains unclear. In this study, we explore the capability of eight LLMs on the radiology report impression summarization. Three types of radiology reports, i.e., CT, PET-CT, and Ultrasound reports, are collected from Peking University Cancer Hospital and Institute. We use the report findings to construct the zero-shot, one-shot, and three-shot prompts with complete example reports to generate the impressions. Besides the automatic quantitative evaluation metrics, we define five human evaluation metrics, i.e., completeness, correctness, conciseness, verisimilitude, and replaceability, to evaluate the semantics of the generated impressions. Two thoracic surgeons (ZSY and LB) and one radiologist (LQ) compare the generated impressions with the reference impressions and score each impression under the five human evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that there is a gap between the generated impressions and reference impressions. Although the LLMs achieve comparable performance in completeness and correctness, the conciseness and verisimilitude scores are not very high. Using few-shot prompts can improve the LLMs' performance in conciseness and verisimilitude, but the clinicians still think the LLMs can not replace the radiologists in summarizing the radiology impressions.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs using standard decoding strategies often struggle with deviations from the inputs. Intuitively, compliant LLM outputs should reflect the information present in the input, which can be measured by point-wise mutual information (PMI) scores. Therefore, we propose Diver, a novel approach that enhances LLM Decoding through span-level PMI verification. During inference, Diver first identifies divergence steps that may lead to multiple candidate spans. Subsequently, it calculates the PMI scores by assessing the log-likelihood gains of the input if the candidate spans are generated. Finally, the optimal span is selected based on the PMI re-ranked output distributions. We evaluate our method across various downstream tasks, and empirical results demonstrate that Diver significantly outperforms existing decoding methods in both performance and versatility.</p></details> |  |

Despite prior attempts in question answering over OwnThink (OQA), existing studies have faced limitations in model representation capabilities, posing challenges in further enhancing overall accuracy in question answering. In this paper, we introduce UniOQA, a unified framework that integrates two complementary parallel workflows. Unlike conventional approaches, UniOQA harnesses large language models (LLMs) for precise question answering and incorporates a direct-answer-prediction process as a cost-effective complement. Initially, to bolster representation capacity, we fine-tune an LLM to translate questions into the Cypher query language (CQL), tackling issues associated with restricted semantic understanding and hallucinations. Subsequently, we introduce the Entity and Relation Replacement algorithm to ensure the executability of the generated CQL. Concurrently, to augment overall accuracy in question answering, we further adapt the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process to the knowledge graph. Ultimately, we optimize answer accuracy through a dynamic decision algorithm. Experimental findings illustrate that UniOQA notably advances SpCQL Logical Accuracy to 21.2% and Execution Accuracy to 54.9%, achieving the new state-of-the-art results on this benchmark. Through ablation experiments, we delve into the superior representation capacity of UniOQA and quantify its performance breakthrough.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, through a newly proposed arithmetical puzzle problem, we show that the model can perform well on multi-step reasoning tasks via fine-tuning on high-quality synthetic data. Experimental results with the open-llama-3B model on three different test datasets show that not only the model can reach a zero-shot pass@1 at 0.44 on the in-domain dataset, it also demonstrates certain generalization capabilities on the out-of-domain datasets. Specifically, this paper has designed two out-of-domain datasets in the form of extending the numerical range and the composing components of the arithmetical puzzle problem separately. The fine-tuned models have shown encouraging performance on these two far more difficult tasks with the zero-shot pass@1 at 0.33 and 0.35, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by Findings of ACL 2024</p></details> |

Still, deep models can encounter performance bottlenecks in real-world data-scarce scenarios, which can be concealed due to the performance saturation with small models on current benchmarks. Meanwhile, large models have demonstrated great powers in these scenarios through large-scale pre-training. Continuous progress has been achieved with the emergence of large language models, exhibiting unprecedented abilities such as few-shot generalization, scalability, and task generality, which are however absent in small deep models. To change the status quo of training scenario-specific small models from scratch, this paper aims at the early development of large time series models (LTSM). During pre-training, we curate large-scale datasets with up to 1 billion time points, unify heterogeneous time series into single-series sequence (S3) format, and develop the GPT-style architecture toward LTSMs. To meet diverse application needs, we convert forecasting, imputation, and anomaly detection of time series into a unified generative task. The outcome of this study is a Time Series Transformer (Timer), which is generative pre-trained by next token prediction and adapted to various downstream tasks with promising capabilities as an LTSM.

In contrast, humans convey and pass down commonsense implicitly through stories. This paper investigates the inherent commonsense ability of large language models (LLMs) expressed through storytelling. We systematically investigate and compare stories and rules for retrieving and leveraging commonsense in LLMs. Experimental results on 28 commonsense QA datasets show that stories outperform rules as the expression for retrieving commonsense from LLMs, exhibiting higher generation confidence and commonsense accuracy. Moreover, stories are the more effective commonsense expression for answering questions regarding daily events, while rules are more effective for scientific questions. This aligns with the reporting bias of commonsense in text corpora. We further show that the correctness and relevance of commonsense stories can be further improved via iterative self-supervised fine-tuning. These findings emphasize the importance of using appropriate language to express, retrieve, and leverage commonsense for LLMs, highlighting a promising direction for better exploiting their commonsense abilities.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |

Despite its significance, recent experiments focusing on English IE tasks have shed light on the challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs) in achieving optimal performance, particularly in sub-tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER). In this paper, we delve into a comprehensive investigation of the performance of mainstream Chinese open-source LLMs in tackling IE tasks, specifically under zero-shot conditions where the models are not fine-tuned for specific tasks. Additionally, we present the outcomes of several few-shot experiments to further gauge the capability of these models. Moreover, our study includes a comparative analysis between these open-source LLMs and ChatGPT, a widely recognized language model, on IE performance. Through meticulous experimentation and analysis, we aim to provide insights into the strengths, limitations, and potential enhancements of existing Chinese open-source LLMs in the domain of Information Extraction within the context of NLP.</p></details> |  |

In practical use, users might provide feedback based on the model's output, hoping for a responsive model that can complete responses according to their feedback. Whether the model can appropriately respond to users' refuting feedback and consistently follow through with execution has not been thoroughly analyzed. In light of this, this paper proposes a comprehensive benchmark, RefuteBench, covering tasks such as question answering, machine translation, and email writing. The evaluation aims to assess whether models can positively accept feedback in form of refuting instructions and whether they can consistently adhere to user demands throughout the conversation. We conduct evaluations on numerous LLMs and find that LLMs are stubborn, i.e. exhibit inclination to their internal knowledge, often failing to comply with user feedback. Additionally, as the length of the conversation increases, models gradually forget the user's stated feedback and roll back to their own responses. We further propose a recall-and-repeat prompts as a simple and effective way to enhance the model's responsiveness to feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024 Findings</p></details> |

Current rule-based vehicle motion planning methods perform satisfactorily in common scenarios but struggle to generalize to long-tailed situations. Meanwhile, learning-based methods have yet to achieve superior performance over rule-based approaches in large-scale closed-loop scenarios. To address these issues, we propose PlanAgent, the first mid-to-mid planning system based on a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM). MLLM is used as a cognitive agent to introduce human-like knowledge, interpretability, and common-sense reasoning into the closed-loop planning. Specifically, PlanAgent leverages the power of MLLM through three core modules. First, an Environment Transformation module constructs a Bird's Eye View (BEV) map and a lane-graph-based textual description from the environment as inputs. Second, a Reasoning Engine module introduces a hierarchical chain-of-thought from scene understanding to lateral and longitudinal motion instructions, culminating in planner code generation. Last, a Reflection module is integrated to simulate and evaluate the generated planner for reducing MLLM's uncertainty. PlanAgent is endowed with the common-sense reasoning and generalization capability of MLLM, which empowers it to effectively tackle both common and complex long-tailed scenarios. Our proposed PlanAgent is evaluated on the large-scale and challenging nuPlan benchmarks. A comprehensive set of experiments convincingly demonstrates that PlanAgent outperforms the existing state-of-the-art in the closed-loop motion planning task. Codes will be soon released.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

These claims of excelling in different functions and tasks rely on measurements taken across various sets of standardized benchmarks showing high scores for such models. We demonstrate here a dramatic breakdown of function and reasoning capabilities of state-of-the-art models trained at the largest available scales which claim strong function, using a simple, short, conventional common sense problem formulated in concise natural language, easily solvable by humans. The breakdown is dramatic, as models also express strong overconfidence in their wrong solutions, while providing often non-sensical "reasoning"-like explanations akin to confabulations to justify and backup the validity of their clearly failed responses, making them sound plausible. Various standard interventions in an attempt to get the right solution, like various type of enhanced prompting, or urging the models to reconsider the wrong solutions again by multi step re-evaluation, fail. We take these initial observations to the scientific and technological community to stimulate urgent re-assessment of the claimed capabilities of current generation of LLMs, Such re-assessment also requires common action to create standardized benchmarks that would allow proper detection of such basic reasoning deficits that obviously manage to remain undiscovered by current state-of-the-art evaluation procedures and benchmarks.

Specifically, the crucial information in the context will be potentially overlooked by model when it is positioned in the trough zone of the attention waveform, leading to decreased performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel inference method named Attention Buckets. It allows LLMs to process their input through multiple parallel processes. Each process utilizes a distinct base angle for the rotary position embedding, thereby creating a unique attention waveform. By compensating an attention trough of a particular process with an attention peak of another process, our approach enhances LLM's awareness to various contextual positions, thus mitigating the risk of overlooking crucial information. In the largest tool-use benchmark, our method elevates a 7B model to achieve state-of-the-art performance, comparable to that of GPT-4. On other benchmarks and some RAG tasks, which also demand a thorough understanding of contextual content, Attention Buckets also exhibited notable enhancements in performance.</p></details> | ACL 2024 main |

Recent advancements have extended their capabilities to handle long-input contexts, exceeding 100k tokens. However, in question answering, language models exhibit uneven utilization of their input context. They tend to favor the initial and final segments, resulting in a U-shaped performance pattern concerning where the answer is located within the input. This bias raises concerns, particularly in summarization where crucial content may be dispersed throughout the source document(s). Besides, in summarization, mapping facts from the source to the summary is not trivial as salient content is usually re-phrased. In this paper, we conduct the first comprehensive study on context utilization and position bias in summarization. Our analysis encompasses 6 LLMs, 10 datasets, and 5 evaluation metrics. We introduce a new evaluation benchmark called MiddleSum on the which we benchmark two alternative inference methods to alleviate position bias: hierarchical summarization and incremental summarization.

Beyond one-pass code generation, recent works further integrate unit tests and program verifiers into LLMs to iteratively refine the generated programs. However, these works consider the generated programs as an indivisible entity, which falls short for LLMs in debugging the programs, especially when the programs contain complex logic flows and data operations. In contrast, when human developers debug programs, they typically set breakpoints and selectively examine runtime execution information. The execution flow and the intermediate variables play a crucial role in the debugging process, yet they are underutilized in the existing literature on code generation. In this study, we introduce Large Language Model Debugger (LDB), a novel debugging framework that enables LLMs to refine their generated programs with the runtime execution information. Specifically, LDB segments the programs into basic blocks and tracks the values of intermediate variables after each block throughout the runtime execution. This allows LLMs to concentrate on simpler code units within the overall execution flow, verify their correctness against the task description block by block, and efficiently pinpoint any potential errors. Experiments demonstrate that LDB consistently enhances the baseline performance by up to 9.8% across the HumanEval, MBPP, and TransCoder benchmarks, archiving new state-of-the-art performance in code debugging for various LLM selections.</p></details> | Preprint |

Recently, LLM-based APR methods have shown promise in repairing real-world bugs. However, existing APR methods often utilize patches generated by LLMs without further optimization, resulting in reduced effectiveness due to the lack of program-specific knowledge. Furthermore, the evaluations of these APR methods have typically been conducted under the assumption of perfect fault localization, which may not accurately reflect their real-world effectiveness. To address these limitations, this paper introduces an innovative APR approach called GIANTREPAIR. Our approach leverages the insight that LLM-generated patches, although not necessarily correct, offer valuable guidance for the patch generation process. Based on this insight, GIANTREPAIR first constructs patch skeletons from LLM-generated patches to confine the patch space, and then generates high-quality patches tailored to specific programs through context-aware patch generation by instantiating the skeletons. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we conduct two large-scale experiments. The results demonstrate that GIANTREPAIR not only effectively repairs more bugs (an average of 27.78% on Defects4J v1.2 and 23.40% on Defects4J v2.0) than using LLM-generated patches directly, but also outperforms state-of-the-art APR methods by repairing at least 42 and 7 more bugs under perfect and automated fault localization scenarios, respectively.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

Before the era of LLMs, machine unlearning research focused mainly on classification tasks in models with small parameters. In these tasks, the content to be forgotten or retained is clear and straightforward. However, as parameter sizes have grown and tasks have become more complex, balancing forget quality and model utility has become more challenging, especially in scenarios involving personal data instead of classification results. Existing methods based on gradient ascent and its variants often struggle with this balance, leading to unintended information loss or partial forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose RKLD, a novel \textbf{R}everse \textbf{KL}-Divergence-based Knowledge \textbf{D}istillation unlearning algorithm for LLMs targeting the unlearning of personal information. Through RKLD, we achieve significant forget quality and effectively maintain the model utility in our experiments.</p></details> | Work is in progress |

However, existing self-detection approaches only retrospectively evaluate answers generated by LLM, typically leading to the over-trust in incorrectly generated answers. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel self-detection paradigm that considers the comprehensive answer space beyond LLM-generated answers. It thoroughly compares the trustability of multiple candidate answers to mitigate the over-trust in LLM-generated incorrect answers. Building upon this paradigm, we introduce a two-step framework, which firstly instructs LLM to reflect and provide justifications for each candidate answer, and then aggregates the justifications for comprehensive target answer evaluation. This framework can be seamlessly integrated with existing approaches for superior self-detection. Extensive experiments on six datasets spanning three tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | Under review |

However, their performance is often hampered by outdated training data and a lack of explainability, which limits clinical applicability. This study aimed to create and assess UroBot, a urology-specialized chatbot, by comparing it with state-of-the-art models and the performance of urologists on urological board questions, ensuring full clinician-verifiability. UroBot was developed using OpenAI's GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and GPT-4o models, employing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and the latest 2023 guidelines from the European Association of Urology (EAU). The evaluation included ten runs of 200 European Board of Urology (EBU) In-Service Assessment (ISA) questions, with performance assessed by the mean Rate of Correct Answers (RoCA). UroBot-4o achieved an average RoCA of 88.4%, surpassing GPT-4o by 10.8%, with a score of 77.6%. It was also clinician-verifiable and exhibited the highest run agreement as indicated by Fleiss' Kappa (k = 0.979). By comparison, the average performance of urologists on board questions, as reported in the literature, is 68.7%. UroBot's clinician-verifiable nature and superior accuracy compared to both existing models and urologists on board questions highlight its potential for clinical integration. The study also provides the necessary code and instructions for further development of UroBot.</p></details> |  |

This enables LLMs to adapt to specific domains and mitigate hallucinations in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing retrievers are often misaligned with LLMs due to their separate training processes and the black-box nature of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose ARL2, a retriever learning technique that harnesses LLMs as labelers. ARL2 leverages LLMs to annotate and score relevant evidence, enabling learning the retriever from robust LLM supervision. Furthermore, ARL2 uses an adaptive self-training strategy for curating high-quality and diverse relevance data, which can effectively reduce the annotation cost. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ARL2, achieving accuracy improvements of 5.4% on NQ and 4.6% on MMLU compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ARL2 exhibits robust transfer learning capabilities and strong zero-shot generalization abilities. Our code will be published at \url{https://github.com/zhanglingxi-cs/ARL2}.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |

Unfortunately, recommendation models to date do not exhibit such laws similar to those observed in the domain of large language models, due to the inefficiencies of their upscaling mechanisms. This limitation poses significant challenges in adapting these models to increasingly more complex real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose an effective network architecture based purely on stacked factorization machines, and a synergistic upscaling strategy, collectively dubbed Wukong, to establish a scaling law in the domain of recommendation. Wukong's unique design makes it possible to capture diverse, any-order of interactions simply through taller and wider layers. We conducted extensive evaluations on six public datasets, and our results demonstrate that Wukong consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models quality-wise. Further, we assessed Wukong's scalability on an internal, large-scale dataset. The results show that Wukong retains its superiority in quality over state-of-the-art models, while holding the scaling law across two orders of magnitude in model complexity, extending beyond 100 GFLOP/example, where prior arts fall short.</p></details> | 12 pages |

While existing watermarking techniques typically prioritize robustness against removal attacks, unfortunately, they are vulnerable to spoofing attacks: malicious actors can subtly alter the meanings of LLM-generated responses or even forge harmful content, potentially misattributing blame to the LLM developer. To overcome this, we introduce a bi-level signature scheme, Bileve, which embeds fine-grained signature bits for integrity checks (mitigating spoofing attacks) as well as a coarse-grained signal to trace text sources when the signature is invalid (enhancing detectability) via a novel rank-based sampling strategy. Compared to conventional watermark detectors that only output binary results, Bileve can differentiate 5 scenarios during detection, reliably tracing text provenance and regulating LLMs. The experiments conducted on OPT-1.3B and LLaMA-7B demonstrate the effectiveness of Bileve in defeating spoofing attacks with enhanced detectability.</p></details> |  |

Recently, repository-level code completion has drawn more attention in modern software development, and several baseline methods and benchmarks have been proposed. However, existing repository-level code completion methods often fall short of fully using the extensive context of a project repository, such as the intricacies of relevant files and class hierarchies. Besides, the existing benchmarks usually focus on limited code completion scenarios, which cannot reflect the repository-level code completion abilities well of existing methods. To address these limitations, we propose the R2C2-Coder to enhance and benchmark the real-world repository-level code completion abilities of code Large Language Models, where the R2C2-Coder includes a code prompt construction method R2C2-Enhance and a well-designed benchmark R2C2-Bench. Specifically, first, in R2C2-Enhance, we first construct the candidate retrieval pool and then assemble the completion prompt by retrieving from the retrieval pool for each completion cursor position. Second, based on R2C2 -Enhance, we can construct a more challenging and diverse R2C2-Bench with training, validation and test splits, where a context perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate the real-world repository-level code completion well. Extensive results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our R2C2-Coder.</p></details> |  |

However, alongside these advancements, the issue of hallucinations has emerged as a significant challenge, producing erroneous responses that are unrelated to the visual contents. In this paper, we introduce a novel contrastive-based decoding method, COuntering DEscription Contrastive Decoding (CODE), which leverages self-generated descriptions as contrasting references during the decoding phase of LMMs to address hallucination issues. CODE utilizes the comprehensive descriptions from model itself as visual counterpart to correct and improve response alignment with actual visual content. By dynamically adjusting the information flow and distribution of next-token predictions in the LMM's vocabulary, CODE enhances the coherence and informativeness of generated responses. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces hallucinations and improves cross-modal consistency across various benchmarks and cutting-edge LMMs. Our method provides a simple yet effective decoding strategy that can be integrated to existing LMM frameworks without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ivy-lvlm.github.io/CODE/</p></details> |

As a result, it is unclear how such robustness generalizes under input distribution shifts, i.e. out-of-distribution (OOD) testing. This omission is concerning as such distribution shifts are unavoidable when methods are deployed in the wild. To address this issue we propose a benchmark named OODRobustBench to comprehensively assess OOD adversarial robustness using 23 dataset-wise shifts (i.e. naturalistic shifts in input distribution) and 6 threat-wise shifts (i.e., unforeseen adversarial threat models). OODRobustBench is used to assess 706 robust models using 60.7K adversarial evaluations. This large-scale analysis shows that: 1) adversarial robustness suffers from a severe OOD generalization issue; 2) ID robustness correlates strongly with OOD robustness in a positive linear way. The latter enables the prediction of OOD robustness from ID robustness. We then predict and verify that existing methods are unlikely to achieve high OOD robustness. Novel methods are therefore required to achieve OOD robustness beyond our prediction. To facilitate the development of these methods, we investigate a wide range of techniques and identify several promising directions.

On the shop floor, human operators contribute with their adaptability and flexibility in dynamic situations, while robots provide precision and the ability to perform repetitive tasks. However, the communication gap between human operators and robots limits the collaboration and coordination of human-robot teams in manufacturing systems. Our research presents a human-robot collaborative assembly framework that utilizes a large language model for enhancing communication in manufacturing environments. The framework facilitates human-robot communication by integrating voice commands through natural language for task management. A case study for an assembly task demonstrates the framework's ability to process natural language inputs and address real-time assembly challenges, emphasizing adaptability to language variation and efficiency in error resolution. The results suggest that large language models have the potential to improve human-robot interaction for collaborative manufacturing assembly applications.</p></details> |  |

Recently, two distinct approaches have emerged to expedite LP solving: (i) First-order methods (FOMs); (ii) Learning to optimize (L2O). In this work, we propose an FOM-unrolled neural network (NN) called PDHG-Net, and propose a two-stage L2O method to solve large-scale LP problems. The new architecture PDHG-Net is designed by unrolling the recently emerged PDHG method into a neural network, combined with channel-expansion techniques borrowed from graph neural networks. We prove that the proposed PDHG-Net can recover PDHG algorithm, thus can approximate optimal solutions of LP instances with a polynomial number of neurons. We propose a two-stage inference approach: first use PDHG-Net to generate an approximate solution, and then apply PDHG algorithm to further improve the solution. Experiments show that our approach can significantly accelerate LP solving, achieving up to a 3$\times$ speedup compared to FOMs for large-scale LP problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |

The use of multi-agent systems has improved adaptability and coordination but requires further advancements in rapid human instruction comprehension, operational adaptability, and coordination through natural language integration. Large language models like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 enhance multi-agent manufacturing systems by enabling agents to communicate in natural language and interpret human instructions for decision-making. This research introduces a novel framework where large language models enhance the capabilities of agents in manufacturing, making them more adaptable, and capable of processing context-specific instructions. A case study demonstrates the practical application of this framework, showing how agents can effectively communicate, understand tasks, and execute manufacturing processes, including precise G-code allocation among agents. The findings highlight the importance of continuous large language model integration into multi-agent manufacturing systems and the development of sophisticated agent communication protocols for a more flexible manufacturing system.</p></details> |  |

Often they also lack the capability of proactively adapting to an attacker's evolving tactics, which restricts the depth of engagement and subsequent information gathering. Under this context, the emergent capabilities of large language models, in tandem with pioneering prompt-based engineering techniques, offer a transformative shift in the design and deployment of honeypot technologies. In this paper, we introduce HoneyGPT, a pioneering honeypot architecture based on ChatGPT, heralding a new era of intelligent honeypot solutions characterized by their cost-effectiveness, high adaptability, and enhanced interactivity, coupled with a predisposition for proactive attacker engagement. Furthermore, we present a structured prompt engineering framework that augments long-term interaction memory and robust security analytics. This framework, integrating thought of chain tactics attuned to honeypot contexts, enhances interactivity and deception, deepens security analytics, and ensures sustained engagement. The evaluation of HoneyGPT includes two parts: a baseline comparison based on a collected dataset and a field evaluation in real scenarios for four weeks. The baseline comparison demonstrates HoneyGPT's remarkable ability to strike a balance among flexibility, interaction depth, and deceptive capability. The field evaluation further validates HoneyGPT's efficacy, showing its marked superiority in enticing attackers into more profound interactive engagements and capturing a wider array of novel attack vectors in comparison to existing honeypot technologies.</p></details> |  |

One way to capture this knowledge is in the form of Bayesian prior distributions. We develop a prompt-based workflow for eliciting prior distributions from LLMs. Our approach is based on iterated learning, a Markov chain Monte Carlo method in which successive inferences are chained in a way that supports sampling from the prior distribution. We validated our method in settings where iterated learning has previously been used to estimate the priors of human participants -- causal learning, proportion estimation, and predicting everyday quantities. We found that priors elicited from GPT-4 qualitatively align with human priors in these settings. We then used the same method to elicit priors from GPT-4 for a variety of speculative events, such as the timing of the development of superhuman AI.</p></details> |  |

In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26$\times$ higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency.

We formulate the problem as a system of coupled partial integro-differential equations describing for the dynamics of the leaders' and followers' densities. We define feasibility conditions and propose two control architectures for exponential global stability. The first architecture is a feed-forward scheme for the followers. It adjusts the leaders' density via a feedback loop, which leverages information about leaders and a fixed reference density, to direct followers towards a target distribution. The second, dual feedback strategy employs a reference-governor to dynamically adapt the leaders' reference density based on measurements on both leaders and followers. Initially analyzed in one dimension, our methods are expanded to multi-dimensional applications. Numerical validations and an application in continuification-based control of leader-follower multiagent systems confirm the effectiveness of our approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, the computational cost and convergence times associated with fine-tuning these models remain significant challenges. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a promising method to mitigate these issues by introducing efficient fine-tuning techniques with a reduced number of trainable parameters. In this paper, we present OLoRA, an enhancement to the LoRA method that leverages orthonormal matrix initialization through QR decomposition. OLoRA significantly accelerates the convergence of LLM training while preserving the efficiency benefits of LoRA, such as the number of trainable parameters and GPU memory footprint. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that OLoRA not only converges faster but also exhibits improved performance compared to standard LoRA across a variety of language modeling tasks. This advancement opens new avenues for more efficient and accessible fine-tuning of LLMs, potentially enabling broader adoption and innovation in natural language applications.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

However, many existing works use a baseline approach, which incurs unnecessary computational costs due to its high time complexity. Further, many studies focus on smaller graphs, which can lead to misleading conclusions. Here, we study the prediction of links using neighborhood-based similarity measures on large graphs. In particular, we improve upon the baseline approach (IBase), and propose a heuristic approach that additionally disregards large hubs (DLH), based on the idea that high-degree nodes contribute little similarity among their neighbors. On a server equipped with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors, DLH is on average 1019x faster than IBase, especially on web graphs and social networks, while maintaining similar prediction accuracy.

The emergence of vision language models has sparked an increase in demands for sharing reports linked to CheXpert images, along with a growing interest among AI fairness researchers in obtaining demographic data. To address this, CheXpert Plus serves as a new collection of radiology data sources, made publicly available to enhance the scaling, performance, robustness, and fairness of models for all subsequent machine learning tasks in the field of radiology. CheXpert Plus is the largest text dataset publicly released in radiology, with a total of 36 million text tokens, including 13 million impression tokens. To the best of our knowledge, it represents the largest text de-identification effort in radiology, with almost 1 million PHI spans anonymized. It is only the second time that a large-scale English paired dataset has been released in radiology, thereby enabling, for the first time, cross-institution training at scale. All reports are paired with high-quality images in DICOM format, along with numerous image and patient metadata covering various clinical and socio-economic groups, as well as many pathology labels and RadGraph annotations.

The emergence of activation sparsity in LLMs provides a natural approach to reduce this cost by involving only parts of the parameters for inference. However, existing methods only focus on utilizing this naturally formed activation sparsity in a post-training setting, overlooking the potential for further amplifying this inherent sparsity. In this paper, we hypothesize that LLMs can learn to be efficient by achieving more structured activation sparsity. To achieve this, we introduce a novel training algorithm, Learn-To-be-Efficient (LTE), designed to train efficiency-aware LLMs to learn to activate fewer neurons and achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance. Furthermore, unlike SOTA MoEfication methods, which mainly focus on ReLU-based models, LTE can also be applied to LLMs like LLaMA using non-ReLU activations. Extensive evaluation on language understanding, language generation, and instruction tuning tasks show that LTE consistently outperforms SOTA baselines. Along with our hardware-aware custom kernel implementation, LTE reduces LLaMA2-7B inference latency by 25% at 50% sparsity.</p></details> |  |

A key idea behind Helix is to formulate inference computation of LLMs over heterogeneous GPUs and network connections as a max-flow problem for a directed, weighted graph, whose nodes represent GPU instances and edges capture both GPU and network heterogeneity through their capacities. Helix then uses a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm to discover highly optimized strategies to serve LLMs. This approach allows Helix to jointly optimize model placement and request scheduling, two highly entangled tasks in heterogeneous LLM serving. Our evaluation on several heterogeneous cluster settings ranging from 24 to 42 GPU nodes shows that Helix improves serving throughput by up to 2.7$\times$ and reduces prompting and decoding latency by up to 2.8$\times$ and 1.3$\times$, respectively, compared to best existing approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, current LLMs that learn from human or external model supervision are costly and may face performance ceilings as task complexity and diversity increase. To address this issue, self-evolution approaches that enable LLM to autonomously acquire, refine, and learn from experiences generated by the model itself are rapidly growing. This new training paradigm inspired by the human experiential learning process offers the potential to scale LLMs towards superintelligence. In this work, we present a comprehensive survey of self-evolution approaches in LLMs. We first propose a conceptual framework for self-evolution and outline the evolving process as iterative cycles composed of four phases: experience acquisition, experience refinement, updating, and evaluation. Second, we categorize the evolution objectives of LLMs and LLM-based agents; then, we summarize the literature and provide taxonomy and insights for each module. Lastly, we pinpoint existing challenges and propose future directions to improve self-evolution frameworks, equipping researchers with critical insights to fast-track the development of self-evolving LLMs. Our corresponding GitHub repository is available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/DAMO-ConvAI/tree/main/Awesome-Self-Evolution-of-LLM</p></details> |  |

For large enough models, we empirically find a time asymmetry in their ability to learn natural language: a difference in the average log-perplexity when trying to predict the next token versus when trying to predict the previous one. This difference is at the same time subtle and very consistent across various modalities (language, model size, training time, ...). Theoretically, this is surprising: from an information-theoretic point of view, there should be no such difference. We provide a theoretical framework to explain how such an asymmetry can appear from sparsity and computational complexity considerations, and outline a number of perspectives opened by our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Re-ar...</summary><p>Re-arranged and updated figures.

| **[What Are Large Language Models Mapping to in the Brain? A Case Against Over-Reliance on Brain Scores](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01538v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs), there has been a growing interest in evaluating their similarity to the human brain. One approach towards quantifying this similarity is by measuring how well a model predicts neural signals, also called "brain score". Internal representations from LLMs achieve state-of-the-art brain scores, leading to speculation that they share computational principles with human language processing. This inference is only valid if the subset of neural activity predicted by LLMs reflects core elements of language processing. Here, we question this assumption by analyzing three neural datasets used in an impactful study on LLM-to-brain mappings, with a particular focus on an fMRI dataset where participants read short passages. We first find that when using shuffled train-test splits, as done in previous studies with these datasets, a trivial feature that encodes temporal autocorrelation not only outperforms LLMs but also accounts for the majority of neural variance that LLMs explain. We therefore use contiguous splits moving forward. Second, we explain the surprisingly high brain scores of untrained LLMs by showing they do not account for additional neural variance beyond two simple features: sentence length and sentence position. This undermines evidence used to claim that the transformer architecture biases computations to be more brain-like. Third, we find that brain scores of trained LLMs on this dataset can largely be explained by sentence length, position, and pronoun-dereferenced static word embeddings; a small, additional amount is explained by sense-specific embeddings and contextual representations of sentence structure. We conclude that over-reliance on brain scores can lead to over-interpretations of similarity between LLMs and brains, and emphasize the importance of deconstructing what LLMs are mapping to in neural signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures in the main paper</p></details> |

This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: representative bias, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and affinity bias, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to `bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references), accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

We introduce the concept of Confidence-Probability Alignment, that connects an LLM's internal confidence, quantified by token probabilities, to the confidence conveyed in the model's response when explicitly asked about its certainty. Using various datasets and prompting techniques that encourage model introspection, we probe the alignment between models' internal and expressed confidence. These techniques encompass using structured evaluation scales to rate confidence, including answer options when prompting, and eliciting the model's confidence level for outputs it does not recognize as its own. Notably, among the models analyzed, OpenAI's GPT-4 showed the strongest confidence-probability alignment, with an average Spearman's $\hat{\rho}$ of 0.42, across a wide range of tasks. Our work contributes to the ongoing efforts to facilitate risk assessment in the application of LLMs and to further our understanding of model trustworthiness.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references), accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we study the two foundational questions in this area. First, how are categorical concepts, such as {'mammal', 'bird', 'reptile', 'fish'}, represented? Second, how are hierarchical relations between concepts encoded? For example, how is the fact that 'dog' is a kind of 'mammal' encoded? We show how to extend the linear representation hypothesis to answer these questions. We find a remarkably simple structure: simple categorical concepts are represented as simplices, hierarchically related concepts are orthogonal in a sense we make precise, and (in consequence) complex concepts are represented as polytopes constructed from direct sums of simplices, reflecting the hierarchical structure. We validate these theoretical results on the Gemma large language model, estimating representations for 957 hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/KihoPark/LLM_Categorical_Hierarchical_Representations</p></details> |

In this paper, we focus on the hybrid analog and digital beamforming architecture of dynamic metasurface antennas, which constitutes a recent prominent enabler of extremely massive antenna architectures, and devise a near-field beam tracking framework that initiates near-field beam sweeping only when the base station estimates that its provided beamforming gain drops below a threshold from its theoretically optimum value. Novel analytical expressions for the correlation function between any two beam focusing vectors, the beamforming gain with respect to user coordinate mismatch, the direction of the user movement yielding the fastest beamforming gain deterioration, and the minimum user displacement for a certain performance loss are presented. We also design a non-uniform coordinate grid for effectively sampling the user area of interest at each position estimation slot. Our extensive simulation results validate our theoretical analysis and showcase the superiority of the proposed near-field beam tracking over benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, submitted to an IEEE Transactions</p></details> |

In this article, we focus on nonlinear noisy leaky integrate and fire (NNLIF) models that describe neuronal activity at the level of the membrane potential of neurons. We introduce a set of novel states, which we call "pseudo-equilibria", and give evidence of their defining role in the behaviour of the NNLIF system when a significant synaptic delay is considered. The advantage is that these states are determined solely by the system's parameters and are derived from a sequence of firing rates that result from solving a recurrence equation. We propose a new strategy to show convergence to an equilibrium for a weakly connected system with large transmission delay, based on following the sequence of pseudo-equilibria. Unlike with the direct entropy dissipation method, this technique allows us to see how a large delay favours convergence. We also present a detailed numerical study to support our results. This study explores the overall behaviour of the NNLIF system and helps us understand, among other phenomena, periodic solutions in strongly inhibitory networks.</p></details> |  |

Despite a rich history of methodological research and development, developing differentially private tabular data generators that can provide realistic synthetic datasets remains challenging. This paper introduces DP-LLMTGen -- a novel framework for differentially private tabular data synthesis that leverages pretrained large language models (LLMs). DP-LLMTGen models sensitive datasets using a two-stage fine-tuning procedure with a novel loss function specifically designed for tabular data. Subsequently, it generates synthetic data through sampling the fine-tuned LLMs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that DP-LLMTGen outperforms a variety of existing mechanisms across multiple datasets and privacy settings. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study and several experimental analyses to deepen our understanding of LLMs in addressing this important problem. Finally, we highlight the controllable generation ability of DP-LLMTGen through a fairness-constrained generation setting.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have identified concerning side effects, such as knowledge distortion and the deterioration of general abilities, that have emerged after editing. This survey presents a comprehensive study of these side effects, providing a unified view of the challenges associated with knowledge editing in LLMs. We discuss related works and summarize potential research directions to overcome these limitations. Our work highlights the limitations of current knowledge editing methods, emphasizing the need for deeper understanding of inner knowledge structures of LLMs and improved knowledge editing methods.

Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Chinese medicine, their performance is sub-optimal in pediatric applications due to inadequate instruction data and vulnerable training procedures. To address the above issues, this paper builds PedCorpus, a high-quality dataset of over 300,000 multi-task instructions from pediatric textbooks, guidelines, and knowledge graph resources to fulfil diverse diagnostic demands. Upon well-designed PedCorpus, we propose PediatricsGPT, the first Chinese pediatric LLM assistant built on a systematic and robust training pipeline. In the continuous pre-training phase, we introduce a hybrid instruction pre-training mechanism to mitigate the internal-injected knowledge inconsistency of LLMs for medical domain adaptation. Immediately, the full-parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is utilized to incorporate the general medical knowledge schema into the models. After that, we devise a direct following preference optimization to enhance the generation of pediatrician-like humanistic responses. In the parameter-efficient secondary SFT phase, a mixture of universal-specific experts strategy is presented to resolve the competency conflict between medical generalist and pediatric expertise mastery. Extensive results based on the metrics, GPT-4, and doctor evaluations on distinct doctor downstream tasks show that PediatricsGPT consistently outperforms previous Chinese medical LLMs. Our model and dataset will be open-source for community development.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Tec...</summary><p>A Technical Report on a Chinese Medical Large Language Model</p></details> |

The models designed to tackle next-location prediction, however, require a significant amount of individual-level information to be trained effectively. Such data may be scarce or even unavailable in some geographic regions or peculiar scenarios (e.g., cold-start in recommendation systems). Moreover, the design of a next-location predictor able to generalize or geographically transfer knowledge is still an open research challenge. Recent advances in natural language processing have led to a rapid diffusion of Large Language Models (LLMs) which have shown good generalization and reasoning capabilities. These insights, coupled with the recent findings that LLMs are rich in geographical knowledge, allowed us to believe that these models can act as zero-shot next-location predictors. This paper evaluates the capabilities of many popular LLMs in this role, specifically Llama, GPT-3.5 and Mistral 7B. After designing a proper prompt, we tested the models on three real-world mobility datasets. The results show that LLMs can obtain accuracies up to 32.4%, a significant relative improvement of over 600% when compared to sophisticated DL models specifically designed for human mobility. Moreover, we show that other LLMs are unable to perform the task properly. To prevent positively biased results, we also propose a framework inspired by other studies to test data contamination. Finally, we explored the possibility of using LLMs as text-based explainers for next-location prediction showing that can effectively provide an explanation for their decision. Notably, 7B models provide more generic, but still reliable, explanations compared to larger counterparts. Code: github.com/ssai-trento/LLM-zero-shot-NL</p></details> |  |

Existing privacy protection methods for LLMs suffer from insufficient privacy protection, performance degradation, or severe inference time overhead. In this paper, we propose PrivacyRestore to protect the privacy of user inputs during LLM inference. PrivacyRestore directly removes privacy spans in user inputs and restores privacy information via activation steering during inference. The privacy spans are encoded as restoration vectors. We propose Attention-aware Weighted Aggregation (AWA) which aggregates restoration vectors of all privacy spans in the input into a meta restoration vector. AWA not only ensures proper representation of all privacy spans but also prevents attackers from inferring the privacy spans from the meta restoration vector alone. This meta restoration vector, along with the query with privacy spans removed, is then sent to the server. The experimental results show that PrivacyRestore can protect private information while maintaining acceptable levels of performance and inference efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparsity-Accelerated Training for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01392v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated proficiency across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks but often require additional training, such as continual pre-training and supervised fine-tuning. However, the costs associated with this, primarily due to their large parameter count, remain high. This paper proposes leveraging \emph{sparsity} in pre-trained LLMs to expedite this training process. By observing sparsity in activated neurons during forward iterations, we identify the potential for computational speed-ups by excluding inactive neurons. We address associated challenges by extending existing neuron importance evaluation metrics and introducing a ladder omission rate scheduler. Our experiments on Llama-2 demonstrate that Sparsity-Accelerated Training (SAT) achieves comparable or superior performance to standard training while significantly accelerating the process. Specifically, SAT achieves a $45\%$ throughput improvement in continual pre-training and saves $38\%$ training time in supervised fine-tuning in practice. It offers a simple, hardware-agnostic, and easily deployable framework for additional LLM training.

However, there is a lack of methods to quantify the integration of new ideas and technological advancements in astronomical research and how these new technologies drive further scientific breakthroughs. Large language models, with their ability to extract key concepts from vast literature beyond keyword searches, provide a new tool to quantify such processes. In this study, we extracted concepts in astronomical research from 297,807 publications between 1993 and 2024 using large language models, resulting in a set of 24,939 concepts. These concepts were then used to form a knowledge graph, where the link strength between any two concepts was determined by their relevance through the citation-reference relationships. By calculating this relevance across different time periods, we quantified the impact of numerical simulations and machine learning on astronomical research. The knowledge graph demonstrates two phases of development: a phase where the technology was integrated and another where the technology was explored in scientific discovery. The knowledge graph reveals that despite machine learning has made much inroad in astronomy, there is currently a lack of new concept development at the intersection of AI and Astronomy, which may be the current bottleneck preventing machine learning from further transforming the field of astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>An in...</summary><p>An interactive version of the knowledge graph is made publicly available at https://astrokg.github.io/.

Measuring the Human Generalization Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01382v1)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What makes large language models (LLMs) impressive is also what makes them hard to evaluate: their diversity of uses. To evaluate these models, we must understand the purposes they will be used for. We consider a setting where these deployment decisions are made by people, and in particular, people's beliefs about where an LLM will perform well. We model such beliefs as the consequence of a human generalization function: having seen what an LLM gets right or wrong, people generalize to where else it might succeed. We collect a dataset of 19K examples of how humans make generalizations across 79 tasks from the MMLU and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We show that the human generalization function can be predicted using NLP methods: people have consistent structured ways to generalize. We then evaluate LLM alignment with the human generalization function. Our results show that -- especially for cases where the cost of mistakes is high -- more capable models (e.g. GPT-4) can do worse on the instances people choose to use them for, exactly because they are not aligned with the human generalization function.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICML 2024</p></details> |

For the CPT on domain-specific LLMs, one important question is how to choose the optimal mixture ratio between the general-corpus (e.g., Dolma, Slim-pajama) and the downstream domain-corpus. Existing methods usually adopt laborious human efforts by grid-searching on a set of mixture ratios, which require high GPU training consumption costs. Besides, we cannot guarantee the selected ratio is optimal for the specific domain. To address the limitations of existing methods, inspired by the Scaling Law for performance prediction, we propose to investigate the Scaling Law of the Domain-specific Continual Pre-Training (D-CPT Law) to decide the optimal mixture ratio with acceptable training costs for LLMs of different sizes. Specifically, by fitting the D-CPT Law, we can easily predict the general and downstream performance of arbitrary mixture ratios, model sizes, and dataset sizes using small-scale training costs on limited experiments. Moreover, we also extend our standard D-CPT Law on cross-domain settings and propose the Cross-Domain D-CPT Law to predict the D-CPT law of target domains, where very small training costs (about 1% of the normal training costs) are needed for the target domains. Comprehensive experimental results on six downstream domains demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed D-CPT Law and Cross-Domain D-CPT Law.</p></details> |  |

Specialized expertise and substantial developer effort are required to fully comprehend dependencies and reveal hidden properties about the dependencies (e.g., number of dependencies, dependency chains, depth of dependencies). Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) allow the retrieval of information from various data sources for response generation, thus providing a new opportunity to uniquely manage software dependencies. To highlight the potential of this technology, we present~\tool, a proof-of-concept Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach that constructs direct and transitive dependencies of software packages as a Knowledge Graph (KG) in four popular software ecosystems. DepsRAG can answer user questions about software dependencies by automatically generating necessary queries to retrieve information from the KG, and then augmenting the input of LLMs with the retrieved information. DepsRAG can also perform Web search to answer questions that the LLM cannot directly answer via the KG. We identify tangible benefits that DepsRAG can offer and discuss its limitations.</p></details> |  |

Although useful priors such as foundation models or crowdsourced datasets are available, they are error-prone. We hence propose an effective framework of active label correction (ALC) based on a design of correction query to rectify pseudo labels of pixels, which in turn is more annotator-friendly than the standard one inquiring to classify a pixel directly according to our theoretical analysis and user study. Specifically, leveraging foundation models providing useful zero-shot predictions on pseudo labels and superpixels, our method comprises two key techniques: (i) an annotator-friendly design of correction query with the pseudo labels, and (ii) an acquisition function looking ahead label expansions based on the superpixels. Experimental results on PASCAL, Cityscapes, and Kvasir-SEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our ALC framework, outperforming prior methods for active semantic segmentation and label correction. Notably, utilizing our method, we obtained a revised dataset of PASCAL by rectifying errors in 2.6 million pixels in PASCAL dataset.</p></details> |  |

This version of quantum logic can express quantum measurements and unitary evolutions of states in a natural way based on concepts advanced in (hybrid and dynamic) modal logics. We then study Horn clauses in the hybrid-dynamic quantum logic proposed, and develop a series of results that lead to an initial semantics theorem for sets of clauses that are satisfiable. This shows that a significant fragment of hybrid-dynamic quantum logic has good computational properties, and can serve as a basis for defining executable languages for specifying quantum programs. We set the foundations of logic programming in this fragment by proving a variant of Herbrand's theorem, which reduces the semantic entailment of a logic-programming query by a program to the search of a suitable substitution.</p></details> |  |

However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Models like ChatGPT are empowered by the concept of transfer learning and self-supervised learning, so they can be easily applied to the downstream tasks after fine-tuning or prompting. These models, so-called Foundation Models (FM), fouce on understanding the human's intent and perform following their designed roles in the specific tasks, which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and language domains. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field.

However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for treatment effect estimations. We propose a novel, theoretically justified method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset methodologies. These results provide compelling evidence that our method has the potential to serve as a stepping stone for the development of causal foundation models.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</p></details> |  |

The outstanding performance of the vision-language model mainly relies on large-scale pre-training datasets and different data augmentation techniques. However, the domain generalization problem of the vision-language foundation model needs to be addressed. This problem has limited the generalizability of the vision-language foundation model to unknown data distributions. In this paper, we introduce a new simple but efficient Diffusion Sampling approach to Domain Generalization (ED-SAM) to improve the generalizability of the vision-language foundation model. Our theoretical analysis in this work reveals the critical role and relation of the diffusion model to domain generalization in the vision-language foundation model. Then, based on the insightful analysis, we introduce a new simple yet effective Transport Transformation to diffusion sampling method. It can effectively generate adversarial samples to improve the generalizability of the foundation model against unknown data distributions. The experimental results on different scales of vision-language pre-training datasets, including CC3M, CC12M, and LAION400M, have consistently shown State-of-the-Art performance and scalability of the proposed ED-SAM approach compared to the other recent methods.</p></details> |  |

With crucial significance, practical prior knowledge derives from sufficient training, while limited amodal annotations pose challenges to achieve better performance. To tackle this problem, utilizing the mighty priors accumulated in the foundation model, we propose the first SAM-based amodal segmentation approach, PLUG. Methodologically, a novel framework with hierarchical focus is presented to better adapt the task characteristics and unleash the potential capabilities of SAM. In the region level, due to the association and division in visible and occluded areas, inmodal and amodal regions are assigned as the focuses of distinct branches to avoid mutual disturbance. In the point level, we introduce the concept of uncertainty to explicitly assist the model in identifying and focusing on ambiguous points. Guided by the uncertainty map, a computation-economic point loss is applied to improve the accuracy of predicted boundaries. Experiments are conducted on several prominent datasets, and the results show that our proposed method outperforms existing methods with large margins.

However, these models also display significant limitations when applied to downstream tasks, such as fine-grained image classification, as a result of ``decision shortcuts'' that hinder their generalization capabilities. In this work, we find that the CLIP model possesses a rich set of features, encompassing both \textit{desired invariant causal features} and \textit{undesired decision shortcuts}. Moreover, the underperformance of CLIP on downstream tasks originates from its inability to effectively utilize pre-trained features in accordance with specific task requirements. To address this challenge, we propose a simple yet effective method, Spurious Feature Eraser (SEraser), to alleviate the decision shortcuts by erasing the spurious features. Specifically, we introduce a test-time prompt tuning paradigm that optimizes a learnable prompt, thereby compelling the model to exploit invariant features while disregarding decision shortcuts during the inference phase. The proposed method effectively alleviates excessive dependence on potentially misleading spurious information. We conduct comparative analysis of the proposed method against various approaches which validates the significant superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, applications involving graph-structured data remain a tough nut for foundation models, due to challenges in the unique feature- and label spaces associated with each graph. Traditional graph ML models such as graph neural networks (GNNs) trained on graphs cannot perform inference on a new graph with feature and label spaces different from the training ones. Furthermore, existing models learn functions specific to the training graph and cannot generalize to new graphs. In this work, we tackle these two challenges with a new foundational architecture for inductive node classification named GraphAny. GraphAny models inference on a new graph as an analytical solution to a LinearGNN, thereby solving the first challenge. To solve the second challenge, we learn attention scores for each node to fuse the predictions of multiple LinearGNNs. Specifically, the attention module is carefully parameterized as a function of the entropy-normalized distance-features between multiple LinearGNNs predictions to ensure generalization to new graphs. Empirically, GraphAny trained on the Wisconsin dataset with only 120 labeled nodes can effectively generalize to 30 new graphs with an average accuracy of 67.26\% in an inductive manner, surpassing GCN and GAT trained in the supervised regime, as well as other inductive baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this position piece we aim to shift the ML research community's priorities ever so slightly to a different modality: tabular data. Tabular data is the dominant modality in many fields, yet it is given hardly any research attention and significantly lags behind in terms of scale and power. We believe the time is now to start developing tabular foundation models, or what we coin a Large Tabular Model (LTM). LTMs could revolutionise the way science and ML use tabular data: not as single datasets that are analyzed in a vacuum, but contextualized with respect to related datasets. The potential impact is far-reaching: from few-shot tabular models to automating data science; from out-of-distribution synthetic data to empowering multidisciplinary scientific discovery. We intend to excite reflections on the modalities we study, and convince some researchers to study large tabular models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Nonetheless, how fine-tuning impacts performance in long-tail learning was not explicitly quantified. In this paper, we disclose that heavy fine-tuning may even lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, and lightweight fine-tuning is more effective. The reason is attributed to inconsistent class conditions caused by heavy fine-tuning. With the observation above, we develop a low-complexity and accurate long-tail learning algorithms LIFT with the goal of facilitating fast prediction and compact models by adaptive lightweight fine-tuning. Experiments clearly verify that both the training time and the learned parameters are significantly reduced with more accurate predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

Despite advancements, a lack of evaluation framework makes it difficult to ensure equitable assessment due to experimental settings, model intricacy, benchmark datasets, and reproducibility challenges. In the absence of standardization, comparative analyses risk becoming biased and unreliable. To surmount this impasse, we introduce GenBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite specifically tailored for evaluating the efficacy of Genomic Foundation Models. GenBench offers a modular and expandable framework that encapsulates a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies. Through systematic evaluations of datasets spanning diverse biological domains with a particular emphasis on both short-range and long-range genomic tasks, firstly including the three most important DNA tasks covering Coding Region, Non-Coding Region, Genome Structure, etc. Moreover, We provide a nuanced analysis of the interplay between model architecture and dataset characteristics on task-specific performance. Our findings reveal an interesting observation: independent of the number of parameters, the discernible difference in preference between the attention-based and convolution-based models on short- and long-range tasks may provide insights into the future design of GFM.</p></details> |  |

Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection, and recognition of relevant objects. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9 imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/biomedparse-project</p></details> |

However, these methods are plagued by significant inefficiency, privacy, and security concerns. Thanks to the emerging foundation generative models, we propose a novel federated learning framework, namely Federated Generative Learning. In this framework, each client can create text embeddings that are tailored to their local data, and send embeddings to the server. Then the informative training data can be synthesized remotely on the server using foundation generative models with these embeddings, which can benefit FL tasks. Our proposed framework offers several advantages, including increased communication efficiency, robustness to data heterogeneity, substantial performance improvements, and enhanced privacy protection. We validate these benefits through extensive experiments conducted on 12 datasets. For example, on the ImageNet100 dataset with a highly skewed data distribution, our method outperforms FedAvg by 12% in a single communication round, compared to FedAvg's performance over 200 communication rounds. We have released the code for all experiments conducted in this study.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, it is crucial to detect and manage these scenarios effectively for autonomous driving systems. However, the rarity and high-risk nature of these cases demand extensive, diverse datasets for training robust models. Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable zero-shot capabilities as being trained on extensive datasets. This work explores the potential of VLMs in detecting hard cases in autonomous driving. We demonstrate the capability of VLMs such as GPT-4v in detecting hard cases in traffic participant motion prediction on both agent and scenario levels. We introduce a feasible pipeline where VLMs, fed with sequential image frames with designed prompts, effectively identify challenging agents or scenarios, which are verified by existing prediction models. Moreover, by taking advantage of this detection of hard cases by VLMs, we further improve the training efficiency of the existing motion prediction pipeline by performing data selection for the training samples suggested by GPT. We show the effectiveness and feasibility of our pipeline incorporating VLMs with state-of-the-art methods on NuScenes datasets.

However, given its unstructured graph representation, the direct generation of high-fidelity 3D meshes is challenging. Fortunately, with a pre-defined ordering strategy, 3D meshes can be represented as sequences, and the generation process can be seamlessly treated as an auto-regressive problem. In this paper, we validate the Neural Coordinate Field (NeurCF), an explicit coordinate representation with implicit neural embeddings, is a simple-yet-effective representation for large-scale sequential mesh modeling. After that, we present MeshXL, a family of generative pre-trained auto-regressive models, which addresses the process of 3D mesh generation with modern large language model approaches. Extensive experiments show that MeshXL is able to generate high-quality 3D meshes, and can also serve as foundation models for various down-stream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iris-SAM: Iris Segmentation Using a Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06497v3)** | 2024-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iris segmentation is a critical component of an iris biometric system and it involves extracting the annular iris region from an ocular image. In this work, we develop a pixel-level iris segmentation model from a foundational model, viz., Segment Anything Model (SAM), that has been successfully used for segmenting arbitrary objects. The primary contribution of this work lies in the integration of different loss functions during the fine-tuning of SAM on ocular images. In particular, the importance of Focal Loss is borne out in the fine-tuning process since it strategically addresses the class imbalance problem (i.e., iris versus non-iris pixels). Experiments on ND-IRIS-0405, CASIA-Iris-Interval-v3, and IIT-Delhi-Iris datasets convey the efficacy of the trained model for the task of iris segmentation. For instance, on the ND-IRIS-0405 dataset, an average segmentation accuracy of 99.58% was achieved, compared to the best baseline performance of 89.75%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Position: Graph Foundation Models are Already Here](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02216v3)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Foundation Models (GFMs) are emerging as a significant research topic in the graph domain, aiming to develop graph models trained on extensive and diverse data to enhance their applicability across various tasks and domains. Developing GFMs presents unique challenges over traditional Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which are typically trained from scratch for specific tasks on particular datasets. The primary challenge in constructing GFMs lies in effectively leveraging vast and diverse graph data to achieve positive transfer. Drawing inspiration from existing foundation models in the CV and NLP domains, we propose a novel perspective for the GFM development by advocating for a ``graph vocabulary'', in which the basic transferable units underlying graphs encode the invariance on graphs. We ground the graph vocabulary construction from essential aspects including network analysis, expressiveness, and stability. Such a vocabulary perspective can potentially advance the future GFM design in line with the neural scaling laws. All relevant resources with GFM design can be found here.</p></details> | 23 pages, 2 figures |

Recent foundation models like GroundingDINO and Segment Anything (SAM) provide opportunities to automatically generate annotations.

We focus on disaster management and provide a large-scale dataset with labels obtained from pre-event imagery over 19 disaster events, derived from the Maxar Open Data initiative. We train segmentation models on the generated labels, using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques to increase transferability to real-world scenarios.

| **[Intelligent Go-Explore: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15143v2)** | 2024-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Go-Explore is a powerful family of algorithms designed to solve hard-exploration problems, built on the principle of archiving discovered states, and iteratively returning to and exploring from the most promising states. This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration, which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g. discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting and previously impossible opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries that cannot be predicted ahead of time. We evaluate IGE on a range of language-based tasks that require search and exploration. In Game of 24, a multistep mathematical reasoning problem, IGE reaches 100% success rate 70.8% faster than the best classic graph search baseline. Next, in BabyAI-Text, a challenging partially observable gridworld, IGE exceeds the previous SOTA with orders of magnitude fewer online samples. Finally, in TextWorld, we show the unique ability of IGE to succeed in settings requiring long-horizon exploration where prior SOTA FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, IGE combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Pretraining is an active research topic, encompassing supervised and self-supervised learning methods to initialize model weights effectively. However, transferring the pretrained models to downstream tasks may encounter task discrepancy due to their formulation of pretraining as image classification or object discrimination tasks. In this study, we explore the Multi-Task Pretraining (MTP) paradigm for RS foundation models to address this issue. Using a shared encoder and task-specific decoder architecture, we conduct multi-task supervised pretraining on the SAMRS dataset, encompassing semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and rotated object detection. MTP supports both convolutional neural networks and vision transformer foundation models with over 300 million parameters. The pretrained models are finetuned on various RS downstream tasks, such as scene classification, horizontal and rotated object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection.

However, the cost of a large number of pixel masks during training is expensive. This paper considers a more challenging scenario, weakly-supervised few-shot segmentation (WS-FSS), which only provides category ($i.e.$ image-level) labels. It requires the model to learn robust support-query information when the generated mask is inaccurate. In this work, we design a Correlation Enhancement Network (CORENet) with foundation model, which utilizes multi-information guidance to learn robust correlation. Specifically, correlation-guided transformer (CGT) utilizes self-supervised ViT tokens to learn robust correlation from both local and global perspectives. From the perspective of semantic categories, the class-guided module (CGM) guides the model to locate valuable correlations through the pre-trained CLIP. Finally, the embedding-guided module (EGM) implicitly guides the model to supplement the inevitable information loss during the correlation learning by the original appearance embedding and finally generates the query mask. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ have shown that CORENet exhibits excellent performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

Current methods employ both 3D representation and multi-view 2D representation to predict the poses of the robot's end-effector. However, they still require a considerable amount of high-quality robot trajectories, and suffer from limited generalization in unseen tasks and inefficient execution in long-horizon reasoning. In this paper, we propose SAM-E, a novel architecture for robot manipulation by leveraging a vision-foundation model for generalizable scene understanding and sequence imitation for long-term action reasoning. Specifically, we adopt Segment Anything (SAM) pre-trained on a huge number of images and promptable masks as the foundation model for extracting task-relevant features, and employ parameter-efficient fine-tuning on robot data for a better understanding of embodied scenarios. To address long-horizon reasoning, we develop a novel multi-channel heatmap that enables the prediction of the action sequence in a single pass, notably enhancing execution efficiency. Experimental results from various instruction-following tasks demonstrate that SAM-E achieves superior performance with higher execution efficiency compared to the baselines, and also significantly improves generalization in few-shot adaptation to new tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7% and 7.4% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in automating and improving binary code analysis.</p></details> |  |

This approach has proven crucial in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). However, the speech processing community lacks a similar setup to explore the paradigm systematically. In this work, we establish the Speech processing Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) to study the effectiveness of the paradigm for speech. We propose a unified multi-tasking framework to address speech processing tasks in SUPERB using a frozen foundation model followed by task-specialized, lightweight prediction heads. Combining our results with community submissions, we verify that the foundation model paradigm is promising for speech, and our multi-tasking framework is simple yet effective, as the best-performing foundation model shows competitive generalizability across most SUPERB tasks. For reproducibility and extensibility, we have developed a long-term maintained platform that enables deterministic benchmarking, allows for result sharing via an online leaderboard, and promotes collaboration through a community-driven benchmark database to support new development cycles.

Alongside these opportunities is the risk that these systems reify existing power imbalances and cause disproportionate harm to marginalized communities. Participatory approaches hold promise to instead lend agency and decision-making power to marginalized stakeholders. But existing approaches in participatory AI/ML are typically deeply grounded in context - how do we apply these approaches to foundation models, which are, by design, disconnected from context? Our paper interrogates this question. First, we examine existing attempts at incorporating participation into foundation models. We highlight the tension between participation and scale, demonstrating that it is intractable for impacted communities to meaningfully shape a foundation model that is intended to be universally applicable. In response, we develop a blueprint for participatory foundation models that identifies more local, application-oriented opportunities for meaningful participation. In addition to the "foundation" layer, our framework proposes the "subfloor'' layer, in which stakeholders develop shared technical infrastructure, norms and governance for a grounded domain, and the "surface'' layer, in which affected communities shape the use of a foundation model for a specific downstream task. The intermediate "subfloor'' layer scopes the range of potential harms to consider, and affords communities more concrete avenues for deliberation and intervention. At the same time, it avoids duplicative effort by scaling input across relevant use cases. Through three case studies in clinical care, financial services, and journalism, we illustrate how this multi-layer model can create more meaningful opportunities for participation than solely intervening at the foundation layer.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 2 figures.

These models are predominantly deployed on high-performance GPUs or hardwired accelerators with highly customized, proprietary instruction sets. Until now, limited attention has been given to RISC-V-based general-purpose platforms. In our work, we present the first end-to-end inference results of transformer models on an open-source many-tiny-core RISC-V platform implementing distributed Softmax primitives and leveraging ISA extensions for SIMD floating-point operand streaming and instruction repetition, as well as specialized DMA engines to minimize costly main memory accesses and to tolerate their latency. We focus on two foundational transformer topologies, encoder-only and decoder-only models. For encoder-only models, we demonstrate a speedup of up to 12.8x between the most optimized implementation and the baseline version. We reach over 79% FPU utilization and 294 GFLOPS/W, outperforming State-of-the-Art (SoA) accelerators by more than 2x utilizing the HW platform while achieving comparable throughput per computational unit. For decoder-only topologies, we achieve 16.1x speedup in the Non-Autoregressive (NAR) mode and up to 35.6x speedup in the Autoregressive (AR) mode compared to the baseline implementation. Compared to the best SoA dedicated accelerator, we achieve 2.04x higher FPU utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables, IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Despite their utility, there is a growing concern that LLMs might inadvertently perpetuate societal stereotypes, resulting in unfair recommendations. Since fairness is critical for RS as many users take it for decision-making and demand fulfillment, this paper focuses on user-side fairness for LLM-based recommendation where the users may require a recommender system to be fair on specific sensitive features such as gender or age. In this paper, we dive into the extent of unfairness exhibited by LLM-based recommender models based on both T5 and LLaMA backbones, and discuss appropriate methods for promoting equitable treatment of users in LLM-based recommendation models. We introduce a novel Counterfactually-Fair-Prompt (CFP) method towards Unbiased Foundation mOdels (UFO) for fairness-aware LLM-based recommendation. Experiments are conducted on two real-world datasets, MovieLens-1M and Insurance, and compared with both matching-based and sequential-based fairness-aware recommendation models. Results show that CFP achieves better recommendation performance with a high level of fairness. Data and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/agiresearch/UP5.</p></details> | In EACL 2024 |

A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.</p></details> |  |

This is essential not only to decrease operating costs but also to speed up deployment time. In this work, we address this challenge for PAnoptic SegmenTation with fEw Labels (PASTEL) by exploiting the groundwork paved by visual foundation models. We leverage descriptive image features from such a model to train two lightweight network heads for semantic segmentation and object boundary detection, using very few annotated training samples. We then merge their predictions via a novel fusion module that yields panoptic maps based on normalized cut. To further enhance the performance, we utilize self-training on unlabeled images selected by a feature-driven similarity scheme. We underline the relevance of our approach by employing PASTEL to important robot perception use cases from autonomous driving and agricultural robotics. In extensive experiments, we demonstrate that PASTEL significantly outperforms previous methods for label-efficient segmentation even when using fewer annotations. The code of our work is publicly available at http://pastel.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Time-Series Foundation Models in Smart Agriculture for Soil Moisture Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18913v1)** | 2024-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent surge in foundation models for natural language processing and computer vision has fueled innovation across various domains. Inspired by this progress, we explore the potential of foundation models for time-series forecasting in smart agriculture, a field often plagued by limited data availability. Specifically, this work presents a novel application of $\texttt{TimeGPT}$, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) time-series foundation model, to predict soil water potential ($\psi_\mathrm{soil}$), a key indicator of field water status that is typically used for irrigation advice. Traditionally, this task relies on a wide array of input variables. We explore $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$'s ability to forecast $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ in: ($i$) a zero-shot setting, ($ii$) a fine-tuned setting relying solely on historic $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ measurements, and ($iii$) a fine-tuned setting where we also add exogenous variables to the model. We compare $\texttt{TimeGPT}$'s performance to established SOTA baseline models for forecasting $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$. Our results demonstrate that $\texttt{TimeGPT}$ achieves competitive forecasting accuracy using only historical $\psi_\mathrm{soil}$ data, highlighting its remarkable potential for agricultural applications. This research paves the way for foundation time-series models for sustainable development in agriculture by enabling forecasting tasks that were traditionally reliant on extensive data collection and domain expertise.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Recent Advances of Foundation Language Models-based Continual Learning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18653v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, foundation language models (LMs) have marked significant achievements in the domains of natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). Unlike traditional neural network models, foundation LMs obtain a great ability for transfer learning by acquiring rich commonsense knowledge through pre-training on extensive unsupervised datasets with a vast number of parameters. However, they still can not emulate human-like continuous learning due to catastrophic forgetting. Consequently, various continual learning (CL)-based methodologies have been developed to refine LMs, enabling them to adapt to new tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. However, a systematic taxonomy of existing approaches and a comparison of their performance are still lacking, which is the gap that our survey aims to fill. We delve into a comprehensive review, summarization, and classification of the existing literature on CL-based approaches applied to foundation language models, such as pre-trained language models (PLMs), large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs). We divide these studies into offline CL and online CL, which consist of traditional methods, parameter-efficient-based methods, instruction tuning-based methods and continual pre-training methods. Offline CL encompasses domain-incremental learning, task-incremental learning, and class-incremental learning, while online CL is subdivided into hard task boundary and blurry task boundary settings. Additionally, we outline the typical datasets and metrics employed in CL research and provide a detailed analysis of the challenges and future work for LMs-based continual learning.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models hold the promise to also transform our ability to model our planet and its subsystems by exploiting the vast expanse of Earth system data. Here we introduce Aurora, a large-scale foundation model of the atmosphere trained on over a million hours of diverse weather and climate data. Aurora leverages the strengths of the foundation modelling approach to produce operational forecasts for a wide variety of atmospheric prediction problems, including those with limited training data, heterogeneous variables, and extreme events. In under a minute, Aurora produces 5-day global air pollution predictions and 10-day high-resolution weather forecasts that outperform state-of-the-art classical simulation tools and the best specialized deep learning models. Taken together, these results indicate that foundation models can transform environmental forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaEarth: A Generative Foundation Model for Global-Scale Remote Sensing Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13570v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of generative foundational models has ushered in a new era of image generation in the realm of natural images, revolutionizing art design, entertainment, environment simulation, and beyond. Despite producing high-quality samples, existing methods are constrained to generating images of scenes at a limited scale. In this paper, we present MetaEarth, a generative foundation model that breaks the barrier by scaling image generation to a global level, exploring the creation of worldwide, multi-resolution, unbounded, and virtually limitless remote sensing images. In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earth visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiupinjia.github.io/metaearth/</p></details> |
| **[One for All: Toward Unified Foundation Models for Earth Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07527v2)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models characterized by extensive parameters and trained on large-scale datasets have demonstrated remarkable efficacy across various downstream tasks for remote sensing data. Current remote sensing foundation models typically specialize in a single modality or a specific spatial resolution range, limiting their versatility for downstream datasets. While there have been attempts to develop multi-modal remote sensing foundation models, they typically employ separate vision encoders for each modality or spatial resolution, necessitating a switch in backbones contingent upon the input data. To address this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective method, termed OFA-Net (One-For-All Network): employing a single, shared Transformer backbone for multiple data modalities with different spatial resolutions. Using the masked image modeling mechanism, we pre-train a single Transformer backbone on a curated multi-modal dataset with this simple design. Then the backbone model can be used in different downstream tasks, thus forging a path towards a unified foundation backbone model in Earth vision. The proposed method is evaluated on 12 distinct downstream tasks and demonstrates promising performance.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[EffoVPR: Effective Foundation Model Utilization for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18065v1)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on task-specific data. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful approach to better exploit the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We first demonstrate that features extracted from self-attention layers can serve as a powerful re-ranker for VPR. Utilizing these features in a zero-shot manner, our method surpasses previous zero-shot methods and achieves competitive results compared to supervised methods across multiple datasets. Subsequently, we demonstrate that a single-stage method leveraging internal ViT layers for pooling can generate global features that achieve state-of-the-art results, even when reduced to a dimensionality as low as 128D. Nevertheless, incorporating our local foundation features for re-ranking, expands this gap. Our approach further demonstrates remarkable robustness and generalization, achieving state-of-the-art results, with a significant gap, in challenging scenarios, involving occlusion, day-night variations, and seasonal changes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v3)** | 2024-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |

Therefore, we feel it is time to bring in rigorous reasoning to secure such systems. The distributed system security and the game theory technical communities can come together to effectively address this challenge. In this article, we lay out the foundations from each that we can build upon to achieve our goals. Next, we describe a set of research challenges for the community, organized into three categories -- analytical, systems, and integration challenges, each with "short term" time horizon (2-3 years) and "long term" (5-10 years) items.

| **[TrojFM: Resource-efficient Backdoor Attacks against Very Large Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16783v1)** | 2024-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One key challenge in backdoor attacks against large foundation models is the resource limits. Backdoor attacks usually require retraining the target model, which is impractical for very large foundation models. Existing backdoor attacks are mainly designed for supervised classifiers or small foundation models (e.g., BERT). None of these attacks has successfully compromised a very large foundation model, such as Llama-3-70B, especially with limited computational resources. In this paper, we propose TrojFM, a novel backdoor attack tailored for very large foundation models. Our primary technical contribution is the development of a novel backdoor injection method. This method forces a backdoored model to generate similar hidden representations for poisoned inputs regardless of their actual semantics. Our approach injects such backdoors by fine-tuning only a very small proportion of model parameters. This enables TrojFM to efficiently launch downstream task-agnostic backdoor attacks against very large foundation models under limited computational resources. Moreover, we optimize the fine-tuning process with our customized QLoRA technique, enabling launching our attack via only~\textit{one A100 GPU}. Furthermore, we design a new trigger injection method to ensure our attack stealthiness. Through extensive experiments, we first demonstrate that TrojFM can launch effective backdoor attacks against widely used large GPT-style models without jeopardizing their normal functionalities (and outperforming existing attacks on BERT-style models). Furthermore, we show that TrojFM is resilient to SOTA defenses and is insensitive to changes in key hyper-parameters. Finally, we conduct a resource analysis to quantify that our method can significantly save computational and memory costs compared to existing backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |

There is a broad consensus that foundations models will be the fundamental building blocks for future AI systems. However, there is a lack of systematic guidance on the architecture design. Particularly, the the rapidly growing capabilities of foundations models can eventually absorb other components of AI systems, posing challenges of moving boundary and interface evolution in architecture design. Furthermore, incorporating foundations models into AI systems raises significant concerns about responsible and safe AI due to their opaque nature and rapidly advancing intelligence. To address these challenges, the paper first presents an architecture evolution of AI systems in the era of foundation models, transitioning from "foundation-model-as-a-connector" to "foundation-model-as-a-monolithic architecture". The paper then identifies key design decisions and proposes a pattern-oriented reference architecture for designing responsible foundation-model-based systems. The patterns can enable the potential of foundation models while ensuring associated risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Few-shot Tuning of Foundation Models for Class-incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16625v1)** | 2024-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For the first time, we explore few-shot tuning of vision foundation models for class-incremental learning. Unlike existing few-shot class incremental learning (FSCIL) methods, which train an encoder on a base session to ensure forward compatibility for future continual learning, foundation models are generally trained on large unlabelled data without such considerations. This renders prior methods from traditional FSCIL incompatible for FSCIL with the foundation model. To this end, we propose Consistency-guided Asynchronous Contrastive Tuning (CoACT), a new approach to continually tune foundation models for new classes in few-shot settings. CoACT comprises three components: (i) asynchronous contrastive tuning, which learns new classes by including LoRA modules in the pre-trained encoder, while enforcing consistency between two asynchronous encoders; (ii) controlled fine-tuning, which facilitates effective tuning of a subset of the foundation model; and (iii) consistency-guided incremental tuning, which enforces additional regularization during later sessions to reduce forgetting of the learned classes. We perform an extensive study on 16 diverse datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of CoACT, outperforming the best baseline method by 2.47% on average and with up to 12.52% on individual datasets. Additionally, CoACT shows reduced forgetting and robustness in low-shot experiments. As an added bonus, CoACT shows up to 13.5% improvement in standard FSCIL over the current SOTA on benchmark evaluations. We make our code publicly available at https://github.com/ShuvenduRoy/CoACT-FSCIL.</p></details> |  |

In the context of intelligent vehicles, leveraging the power of foundation models has proven to be transformative, offering notable advancements in visual understanding. Equipped with multi-modal and multi-task learning capabilities, multi-modal multi-task visual understanding foundation models (MM-VUFMs) effectively process and fuse data from diverse modalities and simultaneously handle various driving-related tasks with powerful adaptability, contributing to a more holistic understanding of the surrounding scene. In this survey, we present a systematic analysis of MM-VUFMs specifically designed for road scenes. Our objective is not only to provide a comprehensive overview of common practices, referring to task-specific models, unified multi-modal models, unified multi-task models, and foundation model prompting techniques, but also to highlight their advanced capabilities in diverse learning paradigms. These paradigms include open-world understanding, efficient transfer for road scenes, continual learning, interactive and generative capability. Moreover, we provide insights into key challenges and future trends, such as closed-loop driving systems, interpretability, embodied driving agents, and world models.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers a novel lens through which we can translate these inscriptions, with the potential to allow non-specialists access to reading these texts and to aid in the decipherment of those hieroglyphs which continue to elude comprehensive interpretation. Toward this, we leverage a foundational model to segment Maya hieroglyphs from an open-source digital library dedicated to Maya artifacts. Despite the initial promise of publicly available foundational segmentation models, their effectiveness in accurately segmenting Maya hieroglyphs was initially limited. Addressing this challenge, our study involved the meticulous curation of image and label pairs with the assistance of experts in Maya art and history, enabling the fine-tuning of these foundational models. This process significantly enhanced model performance, illustrating the potential of fine-tuning approaches and the value of our expanding dataset. We plan to open-source this dataset for encouraging future research, and eventually to help make the hieroglyphic texts legible to a broader community, particularly for Maya heritage community members.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are not tailored to support remote sensing data, which is widely used in important applications including environmental monitoring and crop-yield prediction. Satellite images are significantly different from natural images -- they can be multi-spectral, irregularly sampled across time -- and existing diffusion models trained on images from the Web do not support them. Furthermore, remote sensing data is inherently spatio-temporal, requiring conditional generation tasks not supported by traditional methods based on captions or images. In this paper, we present DiffusionSat, to date the largest generative foundation model trained on a collection of publicly available large, high-resolution remote sensing datasets. As text-based captions are sparsely available for satellite images, we incorporate the associated metadata such as geolocation as conditioning information. Our method produces realistic samples and can be used to solve multiple generative tasks including temporal generation, superresolution given multi-spectral inputs and in-painting. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for satellite image generation and is the first large-scale generative foundation model for satellite imagery.

While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |
| **[PatchProt: Hydrophobic patch prediction using protein foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15928v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hydrophobic patches on protein surfaces play important functional roles in protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. Large hydrophobic surfaces are also involved in the progression of aggregation diseases. Predicting exposed hydrophobic patches from a protein sequence has been shown to be a difficult task. Fine-tuning foundation models allows for adapting a model to the specific nuances of a new task using a much smaller dataset. Additionally, multi-task deep learning offers a promising solution for addressing data gaps, simultaneously outperforming single-task methods. In this study, we harnessed a recently released leading large language model ESM-2. Efficient fine-tuning of ESM-2 was achieved by leveraging a recently developed parameter-efficient fine-tuning method. This approach enabled comprehensive training of model layers without excessive parameters and without the need to include a computationally expensive multiple sequence analysis. We explored several related tasks, at local (residue) and global (protein) levels, to improve the representation of the model. As a result, our fine-tuned ESM-2 model, PatchProt, cannot only predict hydrophobic patch areas but also outperforms existing methods at predicting primary tasks, including secondary structure and surface accessibility predictions. Importantly, our analysis shows that including related local tasks can improve predictions on more difficult global tasks. This research sets a new standard for sequence-based protein property prediction and highlights the remarkable potential of fine-tuning foundation models enriching the model representation by training over related tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our model, called BrainMorph, serves as a tool that supports multi-modal, pairwise, and scalable groupwise registration. BrainMorph is trained on a massive dataset of over 100,000 3D volumes, skull-stripped and non-skull-stripped, from nearly 16,000 unique healthy and diseased subjects. BrainMorph is robust to large misalignments, interpretable via interrogating automatically-extracted keypoints, and enables rapid and controllable generation of many plausible transformations with different alignment types and different degrees of nonlinearity at test-time. We demonstrate the superiority of BrainMorph in solving 3D rigid, affine, and nonlinear registration on a variety of multi-modal brain MRI scans of healthy and diseased subjects, in both the pairwise and groupwise setting. In particular, we show registration accuracy and speeds that surpass current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context of large initial misalignments and large group settings.

However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |

Current smart robots are created using manual programming, mathematical models, planning frameworks, and reinforcement learning. These methods do not lead to the leaps in performance and generality seen with deep learning, generative AI, and foundation models (FMs). Today's robots do not learn to provide home care, to be nursing assistants, or to do household chores nearly as well as people do. Addressing the aspirational opportunities of robot service applications requires improving how they are created. The high cost of bipedal multi-sensory robots ("bodies") is a significant obstacle for both research and deployment. A deeper issue is that mainstream FMs ("minds") do not support sensing, acting, and learning in context in the real world. They do not lead to robots that communicate well or collaborate. They do not lead to robots that try to learn by experimenting, by asking others, or by imitation learning as appropriate. They do not lead to robots that know enough to be deployed widely in service applications. This paper focuses on what human-compatible service robots need to know. It recommends developing experiential (aka "robotic") FMs for bootstrapping them.</p></details> | 15 pages |

We present LM-Weather, a generic approach to taming PLMs, that have learned massive sequential knowledge from the universe of natural language databases, to acquire an immediate capability to obtain highly customized models for heterogeneous meteorological data on devices while keeping high efficiency. Concretely, we introduce a lightweight personalized adapter into PLMs and endows it with weather pattern awareness. During communication between clients and the server, low-rank-based transmission is performed to effectively fuse the global knowledge among devices while maintaining high communication efficiency and ensuring privacy. Experiments on real-wold dataset show that LM-Weather outperforms the state-of-the-art results by a large margin across various tasks (e.g., forecasting and imputation at different scales). We provide extensive and in-depth analyses experiments, which verify that LM-Weather can (1) indeed leverage sequential knowledge from natural language to accurately handle meteorological sequence, (2) allows each devices obtain highly customized models under significant heterogeneity, and (3) generalize under data-limited and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, under review</p></details> |

With the success of foundation models and especially vision-language models, recent works attempt to achieve zeroshot semantic segmentation while requiring either large-scale training or additional image/pixel level annotations. In this work, we generate free annotations for any semantic segmentation dataset using existing foundation models. We use CLIP to detect objects and SAM to generate high quality object masks. Next, we build a lightweight module on top of a self-supervised vision encoder, DinoV2, to align the patch features with a pretrained text encoder for zeroshot semantic segmentation. Our approach can bring language-based semantics to any pretrained vision encoder with minimal training. Our module is lightweight, uses foundation models as the sole source of supervision and shows impressive generalization capability from little training data with no annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Tuning Strikes Back: Customizing Foundation Models with Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15282v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the standard for customising Foundation Models (FMs) to user-specific downstream tasks. However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LOPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter.

However, many of these approaches introduce additional complexity, can require multiple training steps and often have a performance cost in comparison to black-box approaches. In this work, we introduce Component Features (ComFe), a novel interpretable-by-design image classification approach that is highly scalable and can obtain better accuracy and robustness in comparison to non-interpretable methods. Inspired by recent developments in computer vision foundation models, ComFe uses a transformer-decoder head and a hierarchical mixture-modelling approach with a foundation model backbone to obtain higher accuracy compared to previous interpretable models across a range of fine-grained vision benchmarks, without the need to individually tune hyper-parameters for each dataset. With only global image labels and no segmentation or part annotations, ComFe can identify consistent component features within an image and determine which of these features are informative in making a prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[EHRMamba: Towards Generalizable and Scalable Foundation Models for Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14567v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have significantly advanced the modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR), yet their deployment in real-world healthcare is limited by several key challenges. Firstly, the quadratic computational cost and insufficient context length of these models pose significant obstacles for hospitals in processing the extensive medical histories typical in EHR data. Additionally, existing models employ separate finetuning for each clinical task, complicating maintenance in healthcare environments. Moreover, these models focus exclusively on either clinical prediction or EHR forecasting, lacking the flexibility to perform well across both. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EHRMamba, a robust foundation model built on the Mamba architecture. EHRMamba can process sequences up to four times longer than previous models due to its linear computational cost. We also introduce a novel approach to Multitask Prompted Finetuning (MTF) for EHR data, which enables EHRMamba to simultaneously learn multiple clinical tasks in a single finetuning phase, significantly enhancing deployment and cross-task generalization. Furthermore, our model leverages the HL7 FHIR data standard to simplify integration into existing hospital systems. Alongside EHRMamba, we open-source Odyssey, a toolkit designed to support the development and deployment of EHR foundation models, with an emphasis on data standardization and interpretability. Our evaluations on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrate that EHRMamba advances state-of-the-art performance across 6 major clinical tasks and excels in EHR forecasting, marking a significant leap forward in the field.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 4 Figures |

This issue arises as contrastive losses unintentionally dissociate features of unmatched points and pixels that share semantic labels, compromising the integrity of learned representations. To overcome this, we harness Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which have revolutionized the acquisition of pixel-level semantics, to enhance 3D representation learning. Specifically, we utilize off-the-shelf VFMs to generate semantic labels for weakly-supervised pixel-to-point contrastive distillation. Additionally, we employ von Mises-Fisher distributions to structure the feature space, ensuring semantic embeddings within the same class remain consistent across varying inputs. Furthermore, we adapt sampling probabilities of points to address imbalances in spatial distribution and category frequency, promoting comprehensive and balanced learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates the challenges posed by traditional methods and consistently surpasses existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper, Canary). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empirically integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target domains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation. Surprisingly, we also observe that STAR prevents the adapted model from the common catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech models and speech translation tasks. Our code aims to open source to the research communities.</p></details> | 23 pages, Preprint |

The challenge is the lack of labeled data for the training of foundation model. To handle this issue, a CLIP-style retinal image foundation model is developed in this paper. Our foundation model, RET-CLIP, is specifically trained on a dataset of 193,865 patients to extract general features of color fundus photographs (CFPs), employing a tripartite optimization strategy to focus on left eye, right eye, and patient level to reflect real-world clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RET-CLIP outperforms existing benchmarks across eight diverse datasets spanning four critical diagnostic categories: diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, multiple disease diagnosis, and multi-label classification of multiple diseases, which demonstrate the performance and generality of our foundation model. The sourse code and pre-trained model are available at https://github.com/sStonemason/RET-CLIP.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarce radio resources and stringent latency requirement make it challenging to meet these demands. To tackle these challenges, over-the-air computation (AirComp) emerges as a potential technology. Specifically, AirComp seamlessly integrates the communication and computation procedures through the superposition property of multiple-access channels, which yields a revolutionary multiple-access paradigm shift from "compute-after-communicate" to "compute-when-communicate". By this means, AirComp enables spectral-efficient and low-latency wireless data aggregation by allowing multiple devices to occupy the same channel for transmission. In this paper, we aim to present the recent advancement of AirComp in terms of foundations, technologies, and applications. The mathematical form and communication design are introduced as the foundations of AirComp, and the critical issues of AirComp over different network architectures are then discussed along with the review of existing literature. The technologies employed for the analysis and optimization on AirComp are reviewed from the information theory and signal processing perspectives. Moreover, we present the existing studies that tackle the practical implementation issues in AirComp systems, and elaborate the applications of AirComp in Internet of Things and edge intelligent networks. Finally, potential research directions are highlighted to motivate the future development of AirComp.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |

However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H&E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a pre-trained foundation model \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), designed to speed up large-scale simulations of various differential equations with high accuracy via error correction. Human-designed simulation algorithms excel at capturing the fundamental physics of engineering problems, but often need to balance the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. While deep learning methods offer innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. FMint bridges these gaps through conditioning on the initial coarse solutions obtained from conventional human-designed algorithms, and trained to obtain refined solutions for various differential equations. Based on the backbone of large language models, we adapt the in-context learning scheme to learn a universal error correction method for dynamical systems from given prompted sequences of coarse solutions. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 600K ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and we conduct extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. FMint outperforms various baselines on large-scale simulation, and demonstrates its capability in generalization to unseen ODEs. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[CrossCheckGPT: Universal Hallucination Ranking for Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13684v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models are prone to hallucination, generating outputs that either contradict the input or are not grounded by factual information. Given the diversity in architectures, training data and instruction tuning techniques, there can be large variations in systems' susceptibility to hallucinations. To assess system hallucination robustness, hallucination ranking approaches have been developed for specific tasks such as image captioning, question answering, summarization, or biography generation. However, these approaches typically compare model outputs to gold-standard references or labels, limiting hallucination benchmarking for new domains. This work proposes "CrossCheckGPT", a reference-free universal hallucination ranking for multimodal foundation models. The core idea of CrossCheckGPT is that the same hallucinated content is unlikely to be generated by different independent systems, hence cross-system consistency can provide meaningful and accurate hallucination assessment scores. CrossCheckGPT can be applied to any model or task, provided that the information consistency between outputs can be measured through an appropriate distance metric. Focusing on multimodal large language models that generate text, we explore two information consistency measures: CrossCheck-explicit and CrossCheck-implicit. We showcase the applicability of our method for hallucination ranking across various modalities, namely the text, image, and audio-visual domains. Further, we propose the first audio-visual hallucination benchmark, "AVHalluBench", and illustrate the effectiveness of CrossCheckGPT, achieving correlations of 98% and 89% with human judgements on MHaluBench and AVHalluBench, respectively.</p></details> | 21 pages.

Deep learning models can identify images across various semantic concepts without the need for annotations. This work proposes to use Geospatial Foundation Models, like Prithvi, for remote sensing image retrieval with multiple benefits: i) the models encode multi-spectral satellite data and ii) generalize without further fine-tuning. We introduce two datasets to the retrieval task and observe a strong performance: Prithvi processes six bands and achieves a mean Average Precision of 97.62% on BigEarthNet-43 and 44.51% on ForestNet-12, outperforming other RGB-based models. Further, we evaluate three compression methods with binarized embeddings balancing retrieval speed and accuracy. They match the retrieval speed of much shorter hash codes while maintaining the same accuracy as floating-point embeddings but with a 32-fold compression.

| **[SAM-CLIP: Merging Vision Foundation Models towards Semantic and Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15308v3)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of publicly available vision foundation models (VFMs), such as CLIP and Segment Anything Model (SAM), is expanding rapidly. VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing AI models in this domain often require extensive annotation and are task-specific, limiting their clinical utility. While recent developments have brought about foundation models for ophthalmology, they are limited by the need to train separate weights for each imaging modality, preventing a comprehensive representation of multi-modal features. This highlights the need for versatile foundation models capable of handling various tasks and modalities in ophthalmology. To address this gap, we present EyeFound, a multimodal foundation model for ophthalmic images. Unlike existing models, EyeFound learns generalizable representations from unlabeled multimodal retinal images, enabling efficient model adaptation across multiple applications. Trained on 2.78 million images from 227 hospitals across 11 ophthalmic modalities, EyeFound facilitates generalist representations and diverse multimodal downstream tasks, even for detecting challenging rare diseases. It outperforms previous work RETFound in diagnosing eye diseases, predicting systemic disease incidents, and zero-shot multimodal VQA. EyeFound provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and lessen the annotation burden on experts, facilitating widespread clinical AI applications for retinal imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |

However, our investigation shows that despite these gains, their potential for real-world applications is restricted by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this paper, we introduce OmniGlue, the first learnable image matcher that is designed with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process, boosting generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally, we propose a novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial and appearance information, leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform comprehensive experiments on a suite of $7$ datasets with varied image domains, including scene-level, object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlue's novel components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of $20.9\%$ with respect to a directly comparable reference model, while also outperforming the recent LightGlue method by $9.5\%$ relatively.Code and model can be found at https://hwjiang1510.github.io/OmniGlue</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

These models have been particularly impactful in the domain of medical diagnostic tasks. With abundant unlabeled data, an LFM has been developed for fundus images using the Vision Transformer (VIT) and a self-supervised learning framework. This LFM has shown promising performance in fundus disease diagnosis across multiple datasets. On the other hand, deep learning models have long been challenged by dataset quality issues, such as image quality and dataset bias. To investigate the influence of data quality on LFM, we conducted explorations in two fundus diagnosis tasks using datasets of varying quality. Specifically, we explored the following questions: Is LFM more robust to image quality? Is LFM affected by dataset bias? Can fine-tuning techniques alleviate these effects? Our investigation found that LFM exhibits greater resilience to dataset quality issues, including image quality and dataset bias, compared to typical convolutional networks. Furthermore, we discovered that overall fine-tuning is an effective adapter for LFM to mitigate the impact of dataset quality issues.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Current solutions in this field remain rooted in conventional deep learning paradigms, requiring the construction of annotated datasets and the design of network architectures. However, the evident drawback with these mainstream solutions lies in the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of curating datasets, alongside the increasing complexity of model structures. In this paper, we propose to address these issues by fully harnessing the capabilities of two existing vision foundation models (VFMs): Stable Diffusion and Segment Anything Model (SAM). Firstly, we construct a Synthetic but photorealistic large-scale Glass Surface Detection dataset, dubbed S-GSD, without any labour cost via Stable Diffusion. This dataset consists of four different scales, consisting of 168k images totally with precise masks. Besides, based on the powerful segmentation ability of SAM, we devise a simple Glass surface sEgMentor named GEM, which follows the simple query-based encoder-decoder architecture. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale glass segmentation dataset GSD-S. Our GEM establishes a new state-of-the-art performance with the help of these two VFMs, surpassing the best-reported method GlassSemNet with an IoU improvement of 2.1%. Additionally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset S-GSD exhibits remarkable performance in zero-shot and transfer learning settings.

This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners.

Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting.

We have curated a distinctive dataset of 283,582 unique video clips categorized under 386 hashtags relating to modern human actions. We release this dataset as a valuable resource for building domain-specific foundation models for human movement modeling tasks such as action recognition. To validate this dataset, which we name TikTokActions, we perform two sets of experiments. First, we pretrain the state-of-the-art VideoMAEv2 with a ViT-base backbone on TikTokActions subset, and then fine-tune and evaluate on popular datasets such as UCF101 and the HMDB51. We find that the performance of the model pre-trained using our Tik-Tok dataset is comparable to models trained on larger action recognition datasets (95.3% on UCF101 and 53.24% on HMDB51). Furthermore, our investigation into the relationship between pre-training dataset size and fine-tuning performance reveals that beyond a certain threshold, the incremental benefit of larger training sets diminishes. This work introduces a useful TikTok video dataset that is available for public use and provides insights into the marginal benefit of increasing pre-training dataset sizes for video-based foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy.

However, this discussion has often taken place at a high level of generality or with a narrow focus on specific technical attributes. In part, this is because defining open source for foundation models has proven tricky, given its significant differences from traditional software development. In order to inform more practical and nuanced decisions about opening AI systems, including foundation models, this paper presents a framework for grappling with openness across the AI stack.

This paradigm has extended to other modalities, including speech, where researchers are actively exploring the combination of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and LLMs into single, unified models capable of addressing multimodal tasks. Among such tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice. Lastly, we outline recommendations for future works on the topic aimed at better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the SFM+LLM solutions for ST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Prospective Role of Foundation Models in Advancing Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02288v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of artificial intelligence and breakthroughs in deep learning, large-scale Foundation Models (FMs), such as GPT, Sora, etc., have achieved remarkable results in many fields including natural language processing and computer vision. The application of FMs in autonomous driving holds considerable promise. For example, they can contribute to enhancing scene understanding and reasoning. By pre-training on rich linguistic and visual data, FMs can understand and interpret various elements in a driving scene, and provide cognitive reasoning to give linguistic and action instructions for driving decisions and planning. Furthermore, FMs can augment data based on the understanding of driving scenarios to provide feasible scenes of those rare occurrences in the long tail distribution that are unlikely to be encountered during routine driving and data collection. The enhancement can subsequently lead to improvement in the accuracy and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Another testament to the potential of FMs' applications lies in World Models, exemplified by the DREAMER series, which showcases the ability to comprehend physical laws and dynamics. Learning from massive data under the paradigm of self-supervised learning, World Model can generate unseen yet plausible driving environments, facilitating the enhancement in the prediction of road users' behaviors and the off-line training of driving strategies. In this paper, we synthesize the applications and future trends of FMs in autonomous driving. By utilizing the powerful capabilities of FMs, we strive to tackle the potential issues stemming from the long-tail distribution in autonomous driving, consequently advancing overall safety in this domain.</p></details> | 45 pages,8 figures |

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 16 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Brain Lesion Segmentation with Mixture of Modality Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10246v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain lesion segmentation plays an essential role in neurological research and diagnosis. As brain lesions can be caused by various pathological alterations, different types of brain lesions tend to manifest with different characteristics on different imaging modalities. Due to this complexity, brain lesion segmentation methods are often developed in a task-specific manner. A specific segmentation model is developed for a particular lesion type and imaging modality. However, the use of task-specific models requires predetermination of the lesion type and imaging modality, which complicates their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a universal foundation model for 3D brain lesion segmentation, which can automatically segment different types of brain lesions for input data of various imaging modalities. We formulate a novel Mixture of Modality Experts (MoME) framework with multiple expert networks attending to different imaging modalities. A hierarchical gating network combines the expert predictions and fosters expertise collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy during training to avoid the degeneration of each expert network and preserve their specialization. We evaluated the proposed method on nine brain lesion datasets, encompassing five imaging modalities and eight lesion types. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art universal models and provides promising generalization to unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work has been early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, its application to time series data, particularly within foundational models, remains underexplored. This paper examines the impact of LoRA on contemporary time series foundational models: Lag-Llama, MOIRAI, and Chronos. We demonstrate LoRA's fine-tuning potential for forecasting the vital signs of sepsis patients in intensive care units (ICUs), emphasizing the models' adaptability to previously unseen, out-of-domain modalities. Integrating LoRA aims to enhance forecasting performance while reducing inefficiencies associated with fine-tuning large models on limited domain-specific data. Our experiments show that LoRA fine-tuning of time series foundational models significantly improves forecasting, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art models trained from scratch on similar modalities. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the trade-offs between the number of tunable parameters and forecasting performance and assess the impact of varying LoRA matrix ranks on model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Foundation Model-oriented Robustness: Robust Image Model Evaluation with Pretrained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10632v3)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable performance over finite datasets, yet whether the scores over the fixed benchmarks can sufficiently indicate the model's performance in the real world is still in discussion. In reality, an ideal robust model will probably behave similarly to the oracle (e.g., the human users), thus a good evaluation protocol is probably to evaluate the models' behaviors in comparison to the oracle. In this paper, we introduce a new robustness measurement that directly measures the image classification model's performance compared with a surrogate oracle (i.e., a foundation model). Besides, we design a simple method that can accomplish the evaluation beyond the scope of the benchmarks. Our method extends the image datasets with new samples that are sufficiently perturbed to be distinct from the ones in the original sets, but are still bounded within the same image-label structure the original test image represents, constrained by a foundation model pretrained with a large amount of samples. As a result, our new method will offer us a new way to evaluate the models' robustness performance, free of limitations of fixed benchmarks or constrained perturbations, although scoped by the power of the oracle. In addition to the evaluation results, we also leverage our generated data to understand the behaviors of the model and our new evaluation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024 Poster</p></details> |
| **[Histopathology Foundation Models Enable Accurate Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show promise across many tasks, but analyses have been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task/dataset. We report the most rigorous single-task validation conducted to date of a histopathology foundation model, and the first performed in ovarian cancer subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using vision transformer and ResNet features generated through varied preprocessing and pretraining procedures. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Hospitals. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for evaluation on a hold-out test set and an external set from the Transcanadian study. Reporting followed the TRIPOD+AI checklist. The vision transformer-based histopathology foundation model, UNI, performed best in every evaluation, with five-class balanced accuracies of 88% and 93% in hold-out internal and external testing, compared to the best ResNet model scores of 68% and 81%, respectively. Normalisations and augmentations aided the generalisability of ResNet-based models, but these still did not match the performance of UNI, which gave the best external performance in any ovarian cancer subtyping study to date. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion in challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many-Shot In-Context Learning in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09798v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are well-known to be effective at few-shot in-context learning (ICL). Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have enabled unprecedentedly long context windows, presenting an opportunity to explore their capability to perform ICL with many more demonstrating examples. In this work, we evaluate the performance of multimodal foundation models scaling from few-shot to many-shot ICL. We benchmark GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro across 10 datasets spanning multiple domains (natural imagery, medical imagery, remote sensing, and molecular imagery) and tasks (multi-class, multi-label, and fine-grained classification). We observe that many-shot ICL, including up to almost 2,000 multimodal demonstrating examples, leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot (<100 examples) ICL across all of the datasets. Further, Gemini 1.5 Pro performance continues to improve log-linearly up to the maximum number of tested examples on many datasets. Given the high inference costs associated with the long prompts required for many-shot ICL, we also explore the impact of batching multiple queries in a single API call. We show that batching up to 50 queries can lead to performance improvements under zero-shot and many-shot ICL, with substantial gains in the zero-shot setting on multiple datasets, while drastically reducing per-query cost and latency. Finally, we measure ICL data efficiency of the models, or the rate at which the models learn from more demonstrating examples. We find that while GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro achieve similar zero-shot performance across the datasets, Gemini 1.5 Pro exhibits higher ICL data efficiency than GPT-4o on most datasets. Our results suggest that many-shot ICL could enable users to efficiently adapt multimodal foundation models to new applications and domains.

| **[Benchmark Early and Red Team Often: A Framework for Assessing and Managing Dual-Use Hazards of AI Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10986v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A concern about cutting-edge or "frontier" AI foundation models is that an adversary may use the models for preparing chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, (CBRN), cyber, or other attacks. At least two methods can identify foundation models with potential dual-use capability; each has advantages and disadvantages: A. Open benchmarks (based on openly available questions and answers), which are low-cost but accuracy-limited by the need to omit security-sensitive details; and B. Closed red team evaluations (based on private evaluation by CBRN and cyber experts), which are higher-cost but can achieve higher accuracy by incorporating sensitive details. We propose a research and risk-management approach using a combination of methods including both open benchmarks and closed red team evaluations, in a way that leverages advantages of both methods. We recommend that one or more groups of researchers with sufficient resources and access to a range of near-frontier and frontier foundation models run a set of foundation models through dual-use capability evaluation benchmarks and red team evaluations, then analyze the resulting sets of models' scores on benchmark and red team evaluations to see how correlated those are. If, as we expect, there is substantial correlation between the dual-use potential benchmark scores and the red team evaluation scores, then implications include the following: The open benchmarks should be used frequently during foundation model development as a quick, low-cost measure of a model's dual-use potential; and if a particular model gets a high score on the dual-use potential benchmark, then more in-depth red team assessments of that model's dual-use capability should be performed. We also discuss limitations and mitigations for our approach, e.g., if model developers try to game benchmarks by including a version of benchmark test data in a model's training data.</p></details> | 62 pages |

SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions. The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications. Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods. This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor. A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task. First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images. Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR. We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom of Committee: Distilling from Foundation Model to Specialized Application Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14035v3)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have yielded impressive performance across a wide range of tasks. Meanwhile, for specific applications, practitioners have been developing specialized application models. To enjoy the benefits of both kinds of models, one natural path is to transfer the knowledge in foundation models into specialized application models, which are generally more efficient for serving. Techniques from knowledge distillation may be applied here, where the application model learns to mimic the foundation model. However, specialized application models and foundation models have substantial gaps in capacity, employing distinct architectures, using different input features from different modalities, and being optimized on different distributions. These differences in model characteristics lead to significant challenges for distillation methods. In this work, we propose creating a teaching committee comprising both foundation model teachers and complementary teachers. Complementary teachers possess model characteristics akin to the student's, aiming to bridge the gap between the foundation model and specialized application models for a smoother knowledge transfer. Further, to accommodate the dissimilarity among the teachers in the committee, we introduce DiverseDistill, which allows the student to understand the expertise of each teacher and extract task knowledge. Our evaluations demonstrate that adding complementary teachers enhances student performance. Finally, DiverseDistill consistently outperforms baseline distillation methods, regardless of the teacher choices, resulting in significantly improved student performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BioCLIP: A Vision Foundation Model for the Tree of Life](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18803v3)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images of the natural world, collected by a variety of cameras, from drones to individual phones, are increasingly abundant sources of biological information. There is an explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification tasks and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines (by 16% to 17% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability. https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip has models, data and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (oral) camera-ready version; data released</p></details> |

Despite the significant achievements of foundation models in vision tasks, including depth estimation, their direct application to the medical domain often results in suboptimal performance. This highlights the need for efficient adaptation methods to adapt these models to endoscopic depth estimation. We propose Endoscopic Depth Any Camera (EndoDAC) which is an efficient self-supervised depth estimation framework that adapts foundation models to endoscopic scenes. Specifically, we develop the Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LoRA) and employ Convolutional Neck blocks to tailor the foundational model to the surgical domain, utilizing remarkably few trainable parameters. Given that camera information is not always accessible, we also introduce a self-supervised adaptation strategy that estimates camera intrinsics using the pose encoder. Our framework is capable of being trained solely on monocular surgical videos from any camera, ensuring minimal training costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains superior performance even with fewer training epochs and unaware of the ground truth camera intrinsics.

We argue, that this correctness needs to be foundational: correctness needs to be based on the operational semantics of their execution environment. In this work we present a foundational system - the DeepSEA system - targeting the Ethereum blockchain as the largest smart contract platform. The DeepSEA system has a small but sufficiently rich programming language amenable for verification, the DeepSEA language, and a verified DeepSEA compiler. Together they enable true end-to-end verification for smart contracts. We demonstrate usability through two case studies: a realistic contract for Decentralized Finance and contract for crowdfunding.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Billion-scale Foundation Model for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05215v3)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is the accepted version for IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (IEEE J-STARS)</p></details> |

Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models.

However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundational models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical records, imaging data, and patient outcomes. It employs data preprocessing techniques and transformer-based architectures to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of the embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</p></details> |  |
