| **[Low-Light Video Enhancement via Spatial-Temporal Consistent Illumination and Reflection Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15660v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Light Video Enhancement (LLVE) seeks to restore dynamic and static scenes plagued by severe invisibility and noise. One critical aspect is formulating a consistency constraint specifically for temporal-spatial illumination and appearance enhanced versions, a dimension overlooked in existing methods. In this paper, we present an innovative video Retinex-based decomposition strategy that operates without the need for explicit supervision to delineate illumination and reflectance components. We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for intrinsic appearance and enforce a scene-level continuity constraint on the illumination field to yield satisfactory consistent decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a novel cross-frame interaction mechanism. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features, thus achieving the desired temporal propagation. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios. Our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |

This work extends the Latent Dirichlet Variational Autoencoder (LDVAE) pixel unmixing scheme by taking into account local spatial context while performing pixel unmixing. The proposed method uses an isotropic convolutional neural network with spatial attention to encode pixels as a dirichlet distribution over endmembers. We have evaluated our model on Samson, Hydice Urban, Cuprite, and OnTech-HSI-Syn-21 datasets. Our model also leverages the transfer learning paradigm for Cuprite Dataset, where we train the model on synthetic data and evaluate it on the real-world data. The results suggest that incorporating spatial context improves both endmember extraction and abundance estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IGARSS 2024</p></details> |
| **[CPT-Interp: Continuous sPatial and Temporal Motion Modeling for 4D Medical Image Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15385v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion information from 4D medical imaging offers critical insights into dynamic changes in patient anatomy for clinical assessments and radiotherapy planning and, thereby, enhances the capabilities of 3D image analysis. However, inherent physical and technical constraints of imaging hardware often necessitate a compromise between temporal resolution and image quality. Frame interpolation emerges as a pivotal solution to this challenge. Previous methods often suffer from discretion when they estimate the intermediate motion and execute the forward warping. In this study, we draw inspiration from fluid mechanics to propose a novel approach for continuously modeling patient anatomic motion using implicit neural representation. It ensures both spatial and temporal continuity, effectively bridging Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications together to naturally facilitate continuous frame interpolation. Our experiments across multiple datasets underscore the method's superior accuracy and speed. Furthermore, as a case-specific optimization (training-free) approach, it circumvents the need for extensive datasets and addresses model generalization issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Planet Scale Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Graph Based On OpenStreetMap And H3 Grid](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15375v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial data plays a central role in modeling our world, for which OpenStreetMap (OSM) provides a rich source of such data. While often spatial data is represented in a tabular format, a graph based representation provides the possibility to interconnect entities which would have been separated in a tabular representation. We propose in our paper a framework which supports a planet scale transformation of OpenStreetMap data into a Spatial Temporal Knowledge Graph. In addition to OpenStreetMap data, we align the different OpenStreetMap geometries on individual h3 grid cells. We compare our constructed spatial knowledge graph to other spatial knowledge graphs and outline our contribution in this paper. As a basis for our computation, we use Apache Sedona as a computational framework for our Spatial Temporal Knowledge Graph construction</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, GeoLD2024: 6th Geospatial Linked Data Workshop, May 26, 2024, Hersonissos, Greece</p></details> |
| **[Mind's Eye of LLMs: Visualization-of-Thought Elicits Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03622v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in language comprehension and various reasoning tasks. However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Facilitating Battery Swapping Services for Freight Trucks with Spatial-Temporal Demand Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04440v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrifying heavy-duty trucks offers a substantial opportunity to curtail carbon emissions, advancing toward a carbon-neutral future. However, the inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Reframing Spatial Reasoning Evaluation in Language Models: A Real-World Simulation Benchmark for Qualitative Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15064v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning plays a vital role in both human cognition and machine intelligence, prompting new research into language models' (LMs) capabilities in this regard. However, existing benchmarks reveal shortcomings in evaluating qualitative spatial reasoning (QSR). These benchmarks typically present oversimplified scenarios or unclear natural language descriptions, hindering effective evaluation. We present a novel benchmark for assessing QSR in LMs, which is grounded in realistic 3D simulation data, offering a series of diverse room layouts with various objects and their spatial relationships. This approach provides a more detailed and context-rich narrative for spatial reasoning evaluation, diverging from traditional, toy-task-oriented scenarios. Our benchmark encompasses a broad spectrum of qualitative spatial relationships, including topological, directional, and distance relations. These are presented with different viewing points, varied granularities, and density of relation constraints to mimic real-world complexities. A key contribution is our logic-based consistency-checking tool, which enables the assessment of multiple plausible solutions, aligning with real-world scenarios where spatial relationships are often open to interpretation. Our benchmark evaluation of advanced LMs reveals their strengths and limitations in spatial reasoning. They face difficulties with multi-hop spatial reasoning and interpreting a mix of different view descriptions, pointing to areas for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-Ready version for IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Consistent Validation for Predictive Methods in Spatial Settings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03527v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial prediction tasks are key to weather forecasting, studying air pollution, and other scientific endeavors. Determining how much to trust predictions made by statistical or physical methods is essential for the credibility of scientific conclusions. Unfortunately, classical approaches for validation fail to handle mismatch between locations available for validation and (test) locations where we want to make predictions. This mismatch is often not an instance of covariate shift (as commonly formalized) because the validation and test locations are fixed (e.g., on a grid or at select points) rather than i.i.d. from two distributions. In the present work, we formalize a check on validation methods: that they become arbitrarily accurate as validation data becomes arbitrarily dense. We show that classical and covariate-shift methods can fail this check. We instead propose a method that builds from existing ideas in the covariate-shift literature, but adapts them to the validation data at hand. We prove that our proposal passes our check. And we demonstrate its advantages empirically on simulated and real data.</p></details> | 52 pages, 14 figures |
| **[SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726v5)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising is a crucial preprocessing procedure for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these kinds of domain knowledge separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more in-depth long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. The SSUMamba can exploit complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Zigzag Scan (SSAZS) strategy for HSIs, which helps exploit the continuous information flow in multiple directions of 3-D characteristics within HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparison methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Video is Worth 256 Bases: Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization Inversion for Zero-Shot Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05856v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a video inversion approach for zero-shot video editing, which models the input video with low-rank representation during the inversion process. The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

| **[Synergizing Spatial Optimization with Large Language Models for Open-Domain Urban Itinerary Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07204v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the novel task of Open-domain Urban Itinerary Planning (OUIP), a paradigm designed to generate personalized urban itineraries from user requests articulated in natural language. This approach is different from traditional itinerary planning, which often restricts the granularity of user inputs, thus hindering genuine personalization. To this end, we present ItiNera, an OUIP system that synergizes spatial optimization with large language models (LLMs) to provide services that customize urban itineraries based on users' needs. Upon receiving the user's itinerary request, the LLM first decomposes it into detailed components, identifying key requirements, including preferences and dislikes. Then, we use these specifics to select candidate POIs from a large-scale collection using embedding-based Preference-aware POI Retrieval. Finally, a preference score-based Cluster-aware Spatial Optimization module clusters, filters, and orders these POIs, followed by the LLM for detailed POI selection and organization to craft a personalized, spatially coherent itinerary. Moreover, we created an LLM-based pipeline to update and personalize a user-owned POI database. This ensures up-to-date POI information, supports itinerary planning, pre-trip research, POI collection, recommendations, and more. To the best of our knowledge, this study marks the first integration of LLMs to innovate itinerary planning, with potential extensions for various urban travel and exploration activities. Offline and online evaluations demonstrate the capacity of our system to deliver more responsive, personalized, and spatially coherent itineraries than current solutions. Our system, deployed on an online platform, has attracted thousands of users for their urban travel planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Create New Knowledge for Spatial Reasoning Tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14379v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The potential for Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate new information offers a potential step change for research and innovation. This is challenging to assert as it can be difficult to determine what an LLM has previously seen during training, making "newness" difficult to substantiate. In this paper we observe that LLMs are able to perform sophisticated reasoning on problems with a spatial dimension, that they are unlikely to have previously directly encountered. While not perfect, this points to a significant level of understanding that state-of-the-art LLMs can now achieve, supporting the proposition that LLMs are able to yield significant emergent properties. In particular, Claude 3 is found to perform well in this regard.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAMBA4D: Efficient Long-Sequence Point Cloud Video Understanding with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14338v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos effectively capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing 3D world we live in. Although static 3D point cloud processing has witnessed significant advancements, designing an effective 4D point cloud video backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Moreover, recent state-of-the-art 4D backbones predominantly rely on transformer-based architectures, which commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly when processing long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4D point cloud video understanding backbone based on the recently advanced State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, our backbone begins by disentangling space and time in raw 4D sequences, and then establishing spatio-temporal correlations using our newly developed Intra-frame Spatial Mamba and Inter-frame Temporal Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is designed to encode locally similar or related geometric structures within a certain temporal searching stride, which can effectively capture short-term dynamics. Subsequently, these locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which globally integrates point features across the entire video with linear complexity, further establishing long-range motion dependencies. Experimental results on human action recognition and 4D semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Especially, for long video sequences, our proposed Mamba-based method has an 87.5% GPU memory reduction, 5.36 times speed-up, and much higher accuracy (up to +10.4%) compared with transformer-based counterparts on MSR-Action3D dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Spectral Graph Neural Networks with Spatially Adaptive Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09071v4)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whilst spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are theoretically well-founded in the spectral domain, their practical reliance on polynomial approximation implies a profound linkage to the spatial domain. As previous studies rarely examine spectral GNNs from the spatial perspective, their spatial-domain interpretability remains elusive, e.g., what information is essentially encoded by spectral GNNs in the spatial domain? In this paper, to answer this question, we investigate the theoretical connection between spectral filtering and spatial aggregation, unveiling an intrinsic interaction that spectral filtering implicitly leads the original graph to an adapted new graph, explicitly computed for spatial aggregation. Both theoretical and empirical investigations reveal that the adapted new graph not only exhibits non-locality but also accommodates signed edge weights to reflect label consistency among nodes. These findings thus highlight the interpretable role of spectral GNNs in the spatial domain and inspire us to rethink graph spectral filters beyond the fixed-order polynomials, which neglect global information. Built upon the theoretical findings, we revisit the state-of-the-art spectral GNNs and propose a novel Spatially Adaptive Filtering (SAF) framework, which leverages the adapted new graph by spectral filtering for an auxiliary non-local aggregation. Notably, our SAF comprehensively models both node similarity and dissimilarity from a global perspective, therefore alleviating persistent deficiencies of GNNs related to long-range dependencies and graph heterophily. Extensive experiments over 13 node classification benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatial interference approach to account for mobility in air pollution studies with multivariate continuous treatments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14194v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop new methodology to improve our understanding of the causal effects of multivariate air pollution exposures on public health. Typically, exposure to air pollution for an individual is measured at their home geographic region, though people travel to different regions with potentially different levels of air pollution. To account for this, we incorporate estimates of the mobility of individuals from cell phone mobility data to get an improved estimate of their exposure to air pollution. We treat this as an interference problem, where individuals in one geographic region can be affected by exposures in other regions due to mobility into those areas. We propose policy-relevant estimands and derive expressions showing the extent of bias one would obtain by ignoring this mobility. We additionally highlight the benefits of the proposed interference framework relative to a measurement error framework for accounting for mobility. We develop novel estimation strategies to estimate causal effects that account for this spatial spillover utilizing flexible Bayesian methodology. Lastly, we use the proposed methodology to study the health effects of ambient air pollution on mortality among Medicare enrollees in the United States.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroHash: A Hyperdimensional Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Spatially-Aware Image Hashing and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11025v3)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customizable image retrieval from large datasets remains a critical challenge, particularly when preserving spatial relationships within images. Traditional hashing methods, primarily based on deep learning, often fail to capture spatial information adequately and lack transparency. In this paper, we introduce NeuroHash, a novel neuro-symbolic framework leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) to enable highly customizable, spatially-aware image retrieval. NeuroHash combines pre-trained deep neural network models with HDC-based symbolic models, allowing for flexible manipulation of hash values to support conditional image retrieval. Our method includes a self-supervised context-aware HDC encoder and novel loss terms for optimizing lower-dimensional bipolar hashing using multilinear hyperplanes. We evaluate NeuroHash on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art hashing methods, as measured by mAP@5K scores and our newly introduced metric, mAP@5Kr, which assesses spatial alignment. The results highlight NeuroHash's ability to achieve competitive performance while offering significant advantages in flexibility and customization, paving the way for more advanced and versatile image retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normalizing Basis Functions: Approximate Stationary Models for Large Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13821v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In geostatistics, traditional spatial models often rely on the Gaussian Process (GP) to fit stationary covariances to data. It is well known that this approach becomes computationally infeasible when dealing with large data volumes, necessitating the use of approximate methods. A powerful class of methods approximate the GP as a sum of basis functions with random coefficients. Although this technique offers computational efficiency, it does not inherently guarantee a stationary covariance. To mitigate this issue, the basis functions can be "normalized" to maintain a constant marginal variance, avoiding unwanted artifacts and edge effects. This allows for the fitting of nearly stationary models to large, potentially non-stationary datasets, providing a rigorous base to extend to more complex problems. Unfortunately, the process of normalizing these basis functions is computationally demanding. To address this, we introduce two fast and accurate algorithms to the normalization step, allowing for efficient prediction on fine grids. The practical value of these algorithms is showcased in the context of a spatial analysis on a large dataset, where significant computational speedups are achieved. While implementation and testing are done specifically within the LatticeKrig framework, these algorithms can be adapted to other basis function methods operating on regular grids.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Spatial Discretization Error on Coarse CFD Simulations Using an OpenFOAM-Embedded Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07441v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for reducing the spatial discretization error of coarse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by enhancing the quality of low-resolution simulations using a deep learning model fed with high-quality data. We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the fine-mesh data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error to about 50% for simulations outside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver in the x- and y-velocity components using an 8x coarser mesh. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics while generating stable predictions for mid-term simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Scenario Logic: A Spatial-Temporal Logic for Modeling and Reasoning of Urban Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13715v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal representations of traffic scenarios can be used to generate test cases for the safety verification of autonomous driving. However, most existing methods are limited in highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving.</p></details> | Submitted to KR 2024 |
| **[SAM-CLIP: Merging Vision Foundation Models towards Semantic and Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15308v3)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of publicly available vision foundation models (VFMs), such as CLIP and Segment Anything Model (SAM), is expanding rapidly. VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

The unlabeled data consisting of both normal and abnormal data is not well explored. We introduce a novel Spatial-aware Attention Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) for one-class semi-supervised generation of health images.Our core insight is the utilization of position encoding and attention to accurately focus on restoring abnormal regions and preserving normal regions. To fully utilize the unlabelled data, SAGAN relaxes the cyclic consistency requirement of the existing unpaired image-to-image conversion methods, and generates high-quality health images corresponding to unlabeled data, guided by the reconstruction of normal images and restoration of pseudo-anomaly images.Subsequently, the discrepancy between the generated healthy image and the original image is utilized as an anomaly score.Extensive experiments on three medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed SAGAN outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accept by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, existing works primarily focus on customized text-to-video generation for single subject, suffering from subject-missing and attribute-binding problems when the video is expected to contain multiple subjects. Furthermore, existing models struggle to assign the desired actions to the corresponding subjects (action-binding problem), failing to achieve satisfactory multi-subject generation performance. To tackle the problems, in this paper, we propose DisenStudio, a novel framework that can generate text-guided videos for customized multiple subjects, given few images for each subject. Specifically, DisenStudio enhances a pretrained diffusion-based text-to-video model with our proposed spatial-disentangled cross-attention mechanism to associate each subject with the desired action. Then the model is customized for the multiple subjects with the proposed motion-preserved disentangled finetuning, which involves three tuning strategies: multi-subject co-occurrence tuning, masked single-subject tuning, and multi-subject motion-preserved tuning. The first two strategies guarantee the subject occurrence and preserve their visual attributes, and the third strategy helps the model maintain the temporal motion-generation ability when finetuning on static images. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate our proposed DisenStudio significantly outperforms existing methods in various metrics. Additionally, we show that DisenStudio can be used as a powerful tool for various controllable generation applications.</p></details> |  |

This technique is highly desirable and finds many applications. However, existing methods lack fine-level control of the makeup style, making it challenging to achieve high-quality results when dealing with large spatial misalignments. To address this problem, we propose a novel Spatial Alignment and Region-Adaptive normalization method (SARA) in this paper. Our method generates detailed makeup transfer results that can handle large spatial misalignments and achieve part-specific and shade-controllable makeup transfer. Specifically, SARA comprises three modules: Firstly, a spatial alignment module that preserves the spatial context of makeup and provides a target semantic map for guiding the shape-independent style codes. Secondly, a region-adaptive normalization module that decouples shape and makeup style using per-region encoding and normalization, which facilitates the elimination of spatial misalignments. Lastly, a makeup fusion module blends identity features and makeup style by injecting learned scale and bias parameters. Experimental results show that our SARA method outperforms existing methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance on two public datasets.</p></details> |  |

Policymakers often rely on large-scale, crowdsourced measurement datasets to assess the distribution of access network performance across geographic areas. These decisions typically rest on the assumption that Internet performance is uniformly distributed within predefined social boundaries, such as zip codes, census tracts, or community areas. However, this assumption may not be valid for two reasons: (1) crowdsourced measurements often exhibit non-uniform sampling densities within geographic areas; and (2) predefined social boundaries may not align with the actual boundaries of Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we model Internet performance as a spatial process. We apply and evaluate a series of statistical techniques to: (1) aggregate Internet performance over a geographic region; (2) overlay interpolated maps with various sampling boundary choices; and (3) spatially cluster boundary units to identify areas with similar performance characteristics. We evaluated the effectiveness of these using a 17-month-long crowdsourced dataset from Ookla Speedtest. We evaluate several leading interpolation methods at varying spatial scales. Further, we examine the similarity between the resulting boundaries for smaller realizations of the dataset. Our findings suggest that our combination of techniques achieves a 56% gain in similarity score over traditional methods that rely on aggregates over raw measurement values for performance summarization. Our work highlights an urgent need for more sophisticated strategies in understanding and addressing Internet access disparities.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Mode Multiplexing for Fiber-Coupled IM/DD Optical Wireless Links with Misalignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12667v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical wireless communication (OWC) emerges as a pivotal solution for achieving terabit-level aggregate throughput in next-generation wireless networks. With the mature high-speed transceivers and advanced (de)multiplexing techniques designed for fiber optics, fiber-coupled OWC can be seamlessly integrated into existing ultra-high-speed networks such as data centres. In particular, OWC leveraging spatial mode multiplexing (SMM) and few-mode fiber (FMF) coupling can significantly increase capacity, though misalignment may reduce performance. This paper presents a thorough investigation into the SMM-enabled FMF coupling OWC systems affected by link misalignment, specifically focusing on systems with intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) receivers. A theoretical analysis is conducted to assess the fiber coupling efficiency of the considered system in the presence of both pointing error and angle of arrival (AOA) fluctuations caused by random device vibrations. Our model elucidates the dependence of coupling efficiency to the order of the incident modes, highlighting the critical role of beam properties in system performance. To mitigate the intermodal crosstalk arising from link misalignment, we employ zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) to enhance the overall aggregated data rate. Through extensive numerical results, we identify optimal system configurations encompassing aperture design and mode selection, leading to a capacity boost exceeding 200%.</p></details> | 13 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Spatial and Modal Optimal Transport for Fast Cross-Modal MRI Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02774v3)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in comprehensive disease diagnosis in clinical medicine. However, acquiring certain modalities, such as T2-weighted images (T2WIs), is time-consuming and prone to be with motion artifacts. It negatively impacts subsequent multi-modal image analysis. To address this issue, we propose an end-to-end deep learning framework that utilizes T1-weighted images (T1WIs) as auxiliary modalities to expedite T2WIs' acquisitions. While image pre-processing is capable of mitigating misalignment, improper parameter selection leads to adverse pre-processing effects, requiring iterative experimentation and adjustment. To overcome this shortage, we employ Optimal Transport (OT) to synthesize T2WIs by aligning T1WIs and performing cross-modal synthesis, effectively mitigating spatial misalignment effects. Furthermore, we adopt an alternating iteration framework between the reconstruction task and the cross-modal synthesis task to optimize the final results. Then, we prove that the reconstructed T2WIs and the synthetic T2WIs become closer on the T2 image manifold with iterations increasing, and further illustrate that the improved reconstruction result enhances the synthesis process, whereas the enhanced synthesis result improves the reconstruction process. Finally, experimental results from FastMRI and internal datasets confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating significant improvements in image reconstruction quality even at low sampling rates.</p></details> |  |

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated impressive capability in capturing spectral-spatial contextual dependencies. However, these architectures suffer from limited receptive fields and quadratic computational complexity, respectively. Fortunately, recent Mamba architectures built upon the State Space Model integrate the advantages of long-range sequence modeling and linear computational efficiency, exhibiting substantial potential in low-dimensional scenarios. Motivated by this, we propose a novel 3D-Spectral-Spatial Mamba (3DSS-Mamba) framework for HSI classification, allowing for global spectral-spatial relationship modeling with greater computational efficiency. Technically, a spectral-spatial token generation (SSTG) module is designed to convert the HSI cube into a set of 3D spectral-spatial tokens. To overcome the limitations of traditional Mamba, which is confined to modeling causal sequences and inadaptable to high-dimensional scenarios, a 3D-Spectral-Spatial Selective Scanning (3DSS) mechanism is introduced, which performs pixel-wise selective scanning on 3D hyperspectral tokens along the spectral and spatial dimensions. Five scanning routes are constructed to investigate the impact of dimension prioritization. The 3DSS scanning mechanism combined with conventional mapping operations forms the 3D-spectral-spatial mamba block (3DMB), enabling the extraction of global spectral-spatial semantic representations. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on HSI classification benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%. The improvement is particularly remarkable as our method yields extra parameters amounting to only 0.117% of those in the backbone architecture.

Existing methods compute the similarity between the query image and exemplars in the 2D spatial domain and perform regression to obtain the counting number. However, these methods overlook the rich information about the spatial distribution of similarity on the exemplar images, leading to significant impact on matching accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a network learning Spatial Similarity Distribution (SSD) for few-shot object counting, which preserves the spatial structure of exemplar features and calculates a 4D similarity pyramid point-to-point between the query features and exemplar features, capturing the complete distribution information for each point in the 4D similarity space. We propose a Similarity Learning Module (SLM) which applies the efficient center-pivot 4D convolutions on the similarity pyramid to map different similarity distributions to distinct predicted density values, thereby obtaining accurate count. Furthermore, we also introduce a Feature Cross Enhancement (FCE) module that enhances query and exemplar features mutually to improve the accuracy of feature matching. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, including FSC-147 and CARPK.

| **[Transfer Learning for Spatial Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15600v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial autoregressive (SAR) model has been widely applied in various empirical economic studies to characterize the spatial dependence among subjects. However, the precision of estimating the SAR model diminishes when the sample size of the target data is limited. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning framework for the SAR model to borrow the information from similar source data to improve both estimation and prediction. When the informative source data sets are known, we introduce a two-stage algorithm, including a transferring stage and a debiasing stage, to estimate the unknown parameters and also establish the theoretical convergence rates for the resulting estimators. If we do not know which sources to transfer, a transferable source detection algorithm is proposed to detect informative sources data based on spatial residual bootstrap to retain the necessary spatial dependence. Its detection consistency is also derived. Simulation studies demonstrate that using informative source data, our transfer learning algorithm significantly enhances the performance of the classical two-stage least squares estimator. In the empirical application, we apply our method to the election prediction in swing states in the 2020 U.S. presidential election, utilizing polling data from the 2016 U.S. presidential election along with other demographic and geographical data. The empirical results show that our method outperforms traditional estimation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12418v4)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time. The implementation code is available at: \url{https://github.com/LincanLi98/STG-Mamba}.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Model for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13257v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction, a critical aspect of intelligent transportation systems, has been increasingly popular in the field of artificial intelligence, driven by the availability of extensive traffic data. The current challenges of traffic flow prediction lie in integrating diverse factors while balancing the trade-off between computational complexity and the precision necessary for effective long-range and large-scale predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-Mamba) model, which is the first to leverage the power of spatial-temporal learning in traffic flow prediction without using graph modeling. The ST-Mamba model can effectively capture the long-range dependency for traffic flow data, thereby avoiding the issue of over-smoothing. The proposed ST-Mamba model incorporates an effective Spatial-Temporal Mixer (ST-Mixer) to seamlessly integrate spatial and temporal data processing into a unified framework and employs a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-SSM) block to improve computational efficiency. The proposed ST-Mamba model, specifically designed for spatial-temporal data, simplifies processing procedure and enhances generalization capabilities, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of long-range traffic flow prediction. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the proposed ST-Mamba model achieves a 61.11\% improvement in computational speed and increases prediction accuracy by 0.67\%. Extensive experiments with real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the \textsf{ST-Mamba} model sets a new benchmark in traffic flow prediction, achieving SOTA performance in computational efficiency for both long- and short-range predictions and significantly improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Within the context of solar radiation, the changing climate may have an effect on photovoltaic (PV) production, especially as the PV industry moves to extend plant lifetimes to 50 years. Predicting PV production while taking into account a changing climate requires data at a resolution that is useful for building PV plants. Although temporal and spatial downscaling of solar radiation data is widely studied, we present a novel method to downscale solar radiation data from daily averages to hourly profiles, while maintaining spatial correlation of parameters characterizing the diurnal profile of solar radiation. The method focuses on the use of a diurnal template which can be shifted and scaled according to the time or year and location and the use of thin plate splines for spatial downscaling. This analysis is applied to data from the National Solar Radiation Database housed at the National Renewable Energy Lab and a case study of the mentioned methods over several sub-regions of continental United States is presented.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |
| **[How Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial-Temporal Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14192v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Inference for Spatial Extreme Value Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07051v3)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is a popular model for analyzing and forecasting extreme weather data. To increase prediction accuracy, spatial information is often pooled via a latent Gaussian process (GP) on the GEV parameters. Inference for GEV-GP models is typically carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, or using approximate inference methods such as the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). However, MCMC becomes prohibitively slow as the number of spatial locations increases, whereas INLA is only applicable in practice to a limited subset of GEV-GP models. In this paper, we revisit the original Laplace approximation for fitting spatial GEV models. In combination with a popular sparsity-inducing spatial covariance approximation technique, we show through simulations that our approach accurately estimates the Bayesian predictive distribution of extreme weather events, is scalable to several thousand spatial locations, and is several orders of magnitude faster than MCMC. A case study in forecasting extreme snowfall across Canada is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process-based Inference for Spatial Energetics Using Bayesian Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09906v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid developments in streaming data technologies have enabled real-time monitoring of human activity that can deliver high-resolution data on health variables over trajectories or paths carved out by subjects as they conduct their daily physical activities. Wearable devices, such as wrist-worn sensors that monitor gross motor activity, have become prevalent and have kindled the emerging field of ``spatial energetics'' in environmental health sciences. We devise a Bayesian inferential framework for analyzing such data while accounting for information available on specific spatial coordinates comprising a trajectory or path using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device embedded within the wearable device. We offer full probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification using spatial-temporal process models adapted for data generated from ``actigraph'' units as the subject traverses a path or trajectory in their daily routine. Anticipating the need for fast inference for mobile health data, we pursue exact inference using conjugate Bayesian models and employ predictive stacking to assimilate inference across these individual models. This circumvents issues with iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We devise Bayesian predictive stacking in this context for models that treat time as discrete epochs and that treat time as continuous. We illustrate our methods with simulation experiments and analysis of data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |

Traditional methods of post-facto image correction, essential for correcting these distortions, often rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their effectiveness, particularly in the presence of spatially variant atmospheric turbulence. Such cases are often solved by partitioning the field-of-view into small patches, deconvolving each patch independently, and merging all patches together. This approach is often inefficient and can produce artifacts. Recent advancements in computational techniques and the advent of deep learning offer new pathways to address these limitations. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging a deep neural network to emulate spatially variant convolutions, offering a breakthrough in the efficiency and accuracy of astronomical image deconvolution. By training on a dataset of images convolved with spatially invariant point spread functions and validating its generalizability to spatially variant conditions, this approach presents a significant advancement over traditional methods. The convolution emulator is used as a forward model in a multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution algorithm for solar images. The emulator enables the deconvolution of solar observations across large fields of view without resorting to patch-wise mosaicking, thus avoiding artifacts associated with such techniques. This method represents a significant computational advantage, reducing processing times by orders of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in A&A</p></details> |

The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, the paper highlights promising future research directions, urging researchers to delve deeper into spatial-temporal data mining. It emphasizes the need to explore untapped opportunities and push the boundaries of knowledge to unlock new insights and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spatial-temporal data mining.

| **[Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining for Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09006v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) consistently requires language and appearance semantics to more understand each other. The need becomes acute especially under hard situations. To achieve, existing works tend to resort to various trans-representing mechanisms to directly feed forward language semantic along main RGB branch, which however will result in referent distribution weakly-mined in space and non-referent semantic contaminated along channel. In this paper, we propose Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining (S\textsuperscript{2}RM) to achieve high-quality cross-modality fusion. It follows a working strategy of trilogy: distributing language feature, spatial semantic recurrent coparsing, and parsed-semantic balancing. During fusion, S\textsuperscript{2}RM will first generate a constraint-weak yet distribution-aware language feature, then bundle features of each row and column from rotated features of one modality context to recurrently correlate relevant semantic contained in feature from other modality context, and finally resort to self-distilled weights to weigh on the contributions of different parsed semantics. Via coparsing, S\textsuperscript{2}RM transports information from the near and remote slice layers of generator context to the current slice layer of parsed context, capable of better modeling global relationship bidirectional and structured. Besides, we also propose a Cross-scale Abstract Semantic Guided Decoder (CASG) to emphasize the foreground of the referent, finally integrating different grained features at a comparatively low cost. Extensive experimental results on four current challenging datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

This study aimed to further improve the performance of ASAD with a short decision window (i.e., <1 s) rather than with long decision windows ranging from 1 to 5 seconds in previous studies. An end-to-end temporal attention network (i.e., TAnet) was introduced in this work. TAnet employs a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, which can more effectively capture the interactions among time steps in collected EEG signals and efficiently assign corresponding weights to those EEG time steps. Experiments demonstrated that, compared with the CNN-based method and recent ASAD methods, TAnet provided improved decoding performance in the KUL dataset, with decoding accuracies of 92.4% (decision window 0.1 s), 94.9% (0.25 s), 95.1% (0.3 s), 95.4% (0.4 s), and 95.5% (0.5 s) with short decision windows (i.e., <1 s). As a new ASAD model with a short decision window, TAnet can potentially facilitate the design of EEG-controlled intelligent hearing aids and sound recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Interpretable Facial Expression Recognition via Spatial Action Unit Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00281v5)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although state-of-the-art classifiers for facial expression recognition (FER) can achieve a high level of accuracy, they lack interpretability, an important feature for end-users. Experts typically associate spatial action units (\aus) from a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions. In this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy is proposed to explicitly incorporate \au cues into classifier training, allowing to train deep interpretable models. During training, this \au codebook is used, along with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to construct a \au heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interest w.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train a deep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining the spatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with \au heatmaps. Using a composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify an image while yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with \au maps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies on image class expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations. Our new strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- or transformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change or significant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two public benchmarks \rafdb, and \affectnet datasets shows that our proposed strategy can improve layer-wise interpretability without degrading classification performance. In addition, we explore a common type of interpretable classifiers that rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods, and show that our approach can also improve CAM interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2024)</p></details> |

Most previous works attempt to explore more additional information and adopt attention mechanisms for improving 3D reconstruction performance, while it would increase computational complexity simultaneously. To achieve a performance-reserving architecture with high computational efficiency, in this work, we propose a simple but effective 3D hand mesh reconstruction network (i.e., HandS3C), which is the first time to incorporate state space model into the task of hand mesh reconstruction. In the network, we design a novel state-space spatial-channel attention module that extends the effective receptive field, extracts hand features in the spatial dimension, and enhances regional features of hands in the channel dimension. This helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known datasets facing heavy occlusions (such as FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandS3C achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a minimal parameters.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Estimating Direct and Indirect Causal Effects of Spatiotemporal Interventions in Presence of Spatial Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08174v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial interference (SI) occurs when the treatment at one location affects the outcomes at other locations. Accounting for spatial interference in spatiotemporal settings poses further challenges as interference violates the stable unit treatment value assumption, making it infeasible for standard causal inference methods to quantify the effects of time-varying treatment at spatially varying outcomes. In this paper, we first formalize the concept of spatial interference in case of time-varying treatment assignments by extending the potential outcome framework under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. We then propose our deep learning based potential outcome model for spatiotemporal causal inference. We utilize latent factor modeling to reduce the bias due to time-varying confounding while leveraging the power of U-Net architecture to capture global and local spatial interference in data over time. Our causal estimators are an extension of average treatment effect (ATE) for estimating direct (DATE) and indirect effects (IATE) of spatial interference on treated and untreated data. Being the first of its kind deep learning based spatiotemporal causal inference technique, our approach shows advantages over several baseline methods based on the experiment results on two synthetic datasets, with and without spatial interference. Our results on real-world climate dataset also align with domain knowledge, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Existing tools for the analysis of spatial data in R might appear too complex to non-specialists which could limit the use of the approach. We present the R package EgoCor which offers a user-friendly interface displaying in one function a range of graphics and tables of parameters to facilitate the decision making about which exponential parameters fit best either raw data or residuals. This function is based on the functions of the R package gstat. Moreover, we implemented a function providing the measure of uncertainty proposed by Dyck and Sauzet. With the R package EgoCor the modelling of spatial correlation structure of health outcomes or spatially structured predictors of health with a measure of uncertainty is made available to non-specialists.</p></details> | <details><summary>Keywo...</summary><p>Keywords: R package, semi-variogram, exponential models, small-area health inequalities</p></details> |

These methods seek to estimate abundance while accounting for multiple complexities found in ecological data, such as observational biases, spatial autocorrelation, and species correlations. There is, however, a lack of user-friendly and computationally efficient software to implement the various models, particularly for large data sets. We developed the spAbundance R package for fitting spatially-explicit Bayesian single-species and multi-species hierarchical distance sampling models, N-mixture models, and generalized linear mixed models. The models within the package can account for spatial autocorrelation using Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes and accommodate species correlations in multi-species models using a latent factor approach, which enables model fitting for data sets with large numbers of sites and/or species. We provide three vignettes and three case studies that highlight spAbundance functionality. We used spatially-explicit multi-species distance sampling models to estimate density of 16 bird species in Florida, USA, an N-mixture model to estimate Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) abundance in New Hampshire, USA, and a spatial linear mixed model to estimate forest aboveground biomass across the continental USA. spAbundance provides a user-friendly, formula-based interface to fit a variety of univariate and multivariate spatially-explicit abundance models. The package serves as a useful tool for ecologists and conservation practitioners to generate improved inference and predictions on the spatial drivers of populations and communities.</p></details> |  |

Yet, such models are prone to errors which can have serious safety implications. Introspection and self-assessment models that aim to detect such errors are therefore of paramount importance for the safe deployment of ADS. Current research on this topic has focused on techniques to monitor the integrity of the perception mechanism in ADS. Existing introspection models in the literature, however, largely concentrate on detecting perception errors by assigning equal importance to all parts of the input data frame to the perception module. This generic approach overlooks the varying safety significance of different objects within a scene, which obscures the recognition of safety-critical errors, posing challenges in assessing the reliability of perception in specific, crucial instances. Motivated by this shortcoming of state of the art, this paper proposes a novel method integrating raw activation patterns of the underlying DNNs, employed by the perception module, analysis with spatial filtering techniques. This novel approach enhances the accuracy of runtime introspection of the DNN-based 3D object detections by selectively focusing on an area of interest in the data, thereby contributing to the safety and efficacy of ADS perception self-assessment processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ITSC 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.07685</p></details> |
| **[CSA-Net: Channel-wise Spatially Autocorrelated Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05755v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with channel-wise feature refining mechanisms have brought noticeable benefits to modelling channel dependencies. However, current attention paradigms fail to infer an optimal channel descriptor capable of simultaneously exploiting statistical and spatial relationships among feature maps. In this paper, to overcome this shortcoming, we present a novel channel-wise spatially autocorrelated (CSA) attention mechanism. Inspired by geographical analysis, the proposed CSA exploits the spatial relationships between channels of feature maps to produce an effective channel descriptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the f irst time that the concept of geographical spatial analysis is utilized in deep CNNs. The proposed CSA imposes negligible learning parameters and light computational overhead to the deep model, making it a powerful yet efficient attention module of choice. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CSA networks (CSA-Nets) through extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet, and MS COCO benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that CSA-Nets are able to consistently achieve competitive performance and superior generalization than several state-of-the-art attention-based CNNs over different benchmark tasks and datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, the pursuit of accuracy in current studies leads to large, long-timestep SNNs, conflicting with the resource constraints of these devices. In order to design lightweight and efficient SNNs, we propose a new approach named LitE-SNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal compression into the automated network design process. Spatially, we present a novel Compressive Convolution block (CompConv) to expand the search space to support pruning and mixed-precision quantization. Temporally, we are the first to propose a compressive timestep search to identify the optimal number of timesteps under specific computation cost constraints. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization to simultaneously learn the architecture parameters and spatial-temporal compression strategies to achieve high performance while minimizing memory and computation costs. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Google Speech Command datasets demonstrate our proposed LitE-SNNs can achieve competitive or even higher accuracy with remarkably smaller model sizes and fewer computation costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Spatially Clustered Compositional Regression: Linking intersectoral GDP contributions to Gini Coefficients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07408v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Gini coefficient is an universally used measurement of income inequality. Intersectoral GDP contributions reveal the economic development of different sectors of the national economy. Linking intersectoral GDP contributions to Gini coefficients will provide better understandings of how the Gini coefficient is influenced by different industries. In this paper, a compositional regression with spatially clustered coefficients is proposed to explore heterogeneous effects over spatial locations under nonparametric Bayesian framework. Specifically, a Markov random field constraint mixture of finite mixtures prior is designed for Bayesian log contrast regression with compostional covariates, which allows for both spatially contiguous clusters and discontinous clusters. In addition, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling that enables simultaneous inference on both cluster configurations and cluster-wise parameters is designed. The compelling empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies and an application to 51 states of United States from 2019 Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Bayesian inference for spatial mean-parameterized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11472v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Count data with complex features arise in many disciplines, including ecology, agriculture, criminology, medicine, and public health. Zero inflation, spatial dependence, and non-equidispersion are common features in count data. There are two classes of models that allow for these features -- he mode-parameterized Conway--Maxwell--Poisson (COMP) distribution and the generalized Poisson model. However both require the use of either constraints on the parameter space or a parameterization that leads to challenges in interpretability. We propose a spatial mean-parameterized COMP model that retains the flexibility of these models while resolving the above issues. We use a Bayesian spatial filtering approach in order to efficiently handle high-dimensional spatial data and we use reversible-jump MCMC to automatically choose the basis vectors for spatial filtering. The COMP distribution poses two additional computational challenges -- an intractable normalizing function in the likelihood and no closed-form expression for the mean. We propose a fast computational approach that addresses these challenges by, respectively, introducing an efficient auxiliary variable algorithm and pre-computing key approximations for fast likelihood evaluation. We illustrate the application of our methodology to simulated and real datasets, including Texas HPV-cancer data and US vaccine refusal data.</p></details> |  |

These drivers impact the trajectory of evolution, and have been hypothesized to influence phylogenetic structure. Here, we set out to assess (1) if spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure leave detectable signatures in phylogenetic structure, (2) the extent, in particular, to which ecology can be detected and discerned in the presence of spatial structure, and (3) the extent to which these phylogenetic signatures generalize across evolutionary systems. To this end, we analyze phylogenies generated by manipulating spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure within three computational models of varied scope and sophistication. We find that selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecology have characteristic effects on phylogenetic metrics, although these effects are complex and not always intuitive. Signatures have some consistency across systems when using equivalent taxonomic unit definitions (e.g., individual, genotype, species). Further, we find that sufficiently strong ecology can be detected in the presence of spatial structure. We also find that, while low-resolution phylogenetic reconstructions can bias some phylogenetic metrics, high-resolution reconstructions recapitulate them faithfully. Although our results suggest potential for evolutionary inference of spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure through phylogenetic analysis, further methods development is needed to distinguish these drivers' phylometric signatures from each other and to appropriately normalize phylogenetic metrics. With such work, phylogenetic analysis could provide a versatile toolkit to study large-scale evolving populations.</p></details> |  |

This paper delves into the progression from All Realities technologies encompassing Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mediated Reality to spatial computing, highlighting their conceptual differences and applications. We explore enabling technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G, cloud and edge computing, and blockchain that underpin the development of spatial computing. We further scrutinize the initial forays into commercial spatial computing devices, with a focus on Apple's Vision Pro, evaluating its technological advancements alongside the challenges it faces. Through this examination, we aim to provide insights into the potential of spatial computing to revolutionize our interaction with digital information and the physical world.</p></details> |  |

The work also introduces a publicly available dataset of imagery, building polygons, and human-generated and curated adjustments that can be used to evaluate existing strategies for aligning building polygons with sUAS imagery. There are no efforts that have aligned pre-existing spatial data with sUAS imagery, and thus, there is no clear state of practice. However, this effort and analysis show that the translational alignment errors present in this type of data, averaging 82px and an intersection over the union of 0.65, which would induce further errors and biases in downstream machine learning systems unless addressed. This study identifies and analyzes the translational alignment errors of 21,619 building polygons in fifty-one orthomosaic images, covering 16787.2 Acres (26.23 square miles), constructed from sUAS raw imagery from nine wide-area disasters (Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Idalia, Hurricane Laura, the Mayfield Tornado, the Musset Bayou Fire, and the Kilauea Eruption). The analysis finds no uniformity among the angle and distance metrics of the building polygon alignments as they present an average degree variance of 0.4 and an average pixel distance variance of 0.45. This work alerts the sUAS community to the problem of spatial alignment and that a simple linear transform, often used to align satellite imagery, will not be sufficient to align spatial data in sUAS orthomosaic imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Pixel-level Classifier for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06525v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vanilla pixel-level classifiers for semantic segmentation are based on a certain paradigm, involving the inner product of fixed prototypes obtained from the training set and pixel features in the test image. This approach, however, encounters significant limitations, i.e., feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the spatial domain. The former struggles with large intra-class variance among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the structured information of semantic objects effectively. This leads to blurred mask boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive (SSA) classifier to address the above challenges. Specifically, we employ the coarse masks obtained from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype towards the center of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image. The adapted prototypes in semantic and spatial domains are then simultaneously considered to accomplish classification decisions. In addition, we propose an online multi-domain distillation learning strategy to improve the adaption process. Experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA significantly improves the segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal increase in computational cost.

| **[Evaluating Adversarial Robustness in the Spatial Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06345v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated the majority of computer vision tasks. However, CNNs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns about deploying these models to safety-critical applications. In contrast, the Human Visual System (HVS), which utilizes spatial frequency channels to process visual signals, is immune to adversarial attacks. As such, this paper presents an empirical study exploring the vulnerability of CNN models in the frequency domain. Specifically, we utilize the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to construct the Spatial-Frequency (SF) layer to produce a block-wise frequency spectrum of an input image and formulate Spatial Frequency CNNs (SF-CNNs) by replacing the initial feature extraction layers of widely-used CNN backbones with the SF layer. Through extensive experiments, we observe that SF-CNN models are more robust than their CNN counterparts under both white-box and black-box attacks. To further explain the robustness of SF-CNNs, we compare the SF layer with a trainable convolutional layer with identical kernel sizes using two mixing strategies to show that the lower frequency components contribute the most to the adversarial robustness of SF-CNNs. We believe our observations can guide the future design of robust CNN models.</p></details> | 14 pages |

The main challenges for traffic flow forecasting are that (1) as the length of prediction time increases, the accuracy of prediction will decrease; (2) the predicted results greatly rely on the extraction of temporal and spatial dependencies from the road networks. To overcome the challenges mentioned above, we propose a multi-channel spatial-temporal transformer model for traffic flow forecasting, which improves the accuracy of the prediction by fusing results from different channels of traffic data. Our approach leverages graph convolutional network to extract spatial features from each channel while using a transformer-based architecture to capture temporal dependencies across channels. We introduce an adaptive adjacency matrix to overcome limitations in feature extraction from fixed topological structures. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that introducing a multi-channel mechanism into the temporal model enhances performance and our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |

| **[Context-Guided Spatial Feature Reconstruction for Efficient Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06228v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is an important task for many applications but it is still quite challenging to achieve advanced performance with limited computational costs. In this paper, we present CGRSeg, an efficient yet competitive segmentation framework based on context-guided spatial feature reconstruction. A Rectangular Self-Calibration Module is carefully designed for spatial feature reconstruction and pyramid context extraction. It captures the global context in both horizontal and vertical directions and gets the axial global context to explicitly model rectangular key areas. A shape self-calibration function is designed to make the key areas more close to the foreground object. Besides, a lightweight Dynamic Prototype Guided head is proposed to improve the classification of foreground objects by explicit class embedding. Our CGRSeg is extensively evaluated on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal Context benchmarks, and achieves state-of-the-art semantic performance. Specifically, it achieves $43.6\%$ mIoU on ADE20K with only $4.0$ GFLOPs, which is $0.9\%$ and $2.5\%$ mIoU better than SeaFormer and SegNeXt but with about $38.0\%$ fewer GFLOPs.

| **[Aerial-NeRF: Adaptive Spatial Partitioning and Sampling for Large-Scale Aerial Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06214v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale scene rendering has yielded Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models with an impressive ability to synthesize scenes across small objects and indoor scenes. Nevertheless, extending this idea to large-scale aerial rendering poses two critical problems. Firstly, a single NeRF cannot render the entire scene with high-precision for complex large-scale aerial datasets since the sampling range along each view ray is insufficient to cover buildings adequately. Secondly, traditional NeRFs are infeasible to train on one GPU to enable interactive fly-throughs for modeling massive images. Instead, existing methods typically separate the whole scene into multiple regions and train a NeRF on each region, which are unaccustomed to different flight trajectories and difficult to achieve fast rendering. To that end, we propose Aerial-NeRF with three innovative modifications for jointly adapting NeRF in large-scale aerial rendering: (1) Designing an adaptive spatial partitioning and selection method based on drones' poses to adapt different flight trajectories; (2) Using similarity of poses instead of (expert) network for rendering speedup to determine which region a new viewpoint belongs to; (3) Developing an adaptive sampling approach for rendering performance improvement to cover the entire buildings at different heights. Extensive experiments have conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of Aerial-NeRF, and new state-of-the-art results have been achieved on two public large-scale aerial datasets and presented SCUTic dataset. Note that our model allows us to perform rendering over 4 times as fast as compared to multiple competitors. Our dataset, code, and model are publicly available at https://drliuqi.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

More flexible spatial extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this paper, we aim to push the boundaries on computation and modeling of high-dimensional spatial extremes via integrating a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and non-stationary dependence properties in the encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder called the XVAE. The XVAE can emulate spatial observations and produce outputs that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the tail. Our approach also provides a novel way of making fast inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than traditional Bayesian inference while outperforming many spatial extremes models with a stationary dependence structure. Lastly, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We demonstrate how to use XVAE to identify regions susceptible to marine heatwaves under climate change and examine the spatial and temporal variability of the extremal dependence structure.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DRSI-Net: Dual-Residual Spatial Interaction Network for Multi-Person Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16640v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE), which aims to locate the key points for all persons in the frames, is an active research branch of computer vision. Variable human poses and complex scenes make MPPE dependent on local details and global structures; their absence may cause key point feature misalignment. In this case, high-order spatial interactions that can effectively link the local and global information of features are particularly important. However, most methods do not include spatial interactions. A few methods have low-order spatial interactions, but achieving a good balance between accuracy and complexity is challenging. To address the above problems, a dual-residual spatial interaction network (DRSI-Net) for MPPE with high accuracy and low complexity is proposed herein. Compared to other methods, DRSI-Net recursively performs residual spatial information interactions on the neighbouring features so that more useful spatial information can be retained and more similarities can be obtained between shallow and deep extracted features. The channel and spatial dual attention mechanism introduced in the multi-scale feature fusion also helps the network to adaptively focus on features relevant to the target key points and further refine the generated poses. Simultaneously, by optimising the interactive channel dimensions and dividing the gradient flow, the spatial interaction module is designed to be lightweight, thus reducing the complexity of the network. According to the experimental results on the COCO dataset, the proposed DRSI-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, harsh weather creates visibility hindrances, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To help a pilot in manual landing, a vision-based system tailored to localize runway elements likewise gets affected, especially during crosswind due to the projective distortion of aircraft camera images. To combat this, we propose to integrate a prompt-based climatic diffusion network with a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss. Precisely, the diffusion model synthesizes climatic-conditioned landing images, and the weather distillation model learns inverse mapping by clearing those visual degradations. Then, to tackle the crosswind landing scenario, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) learns to accurately calibrate for projective distortion using self-supervised learning, which minimizes localization error by the downstream runway object detector. Finally, we have simulated a clear-day landing scenario at the busiest airport globally to curate an image-based Aircraft Landing Dataset (AIRLAD) and experimentally validated our contributions using this dataset to benchmark the performance.</p></details> |  |

While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. In response to this challenge, we present an enhanced unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm called DynaSeg. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on a fixed weight factor to balance feature similarity and spatial continuity, requiring manual adjustments, our novel, dynamic weighting scheme automates parameter tuning, adapting flexibly to image details. We also introduce the novel concept of a Silhouette Score Phase that addresses the challenge of dynamic clustering during iterations. Additionally, our methodology integrates both CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, offering a comprehensive and adaptable approach. We achieve state-of-the-art results on diverse datasets, with a notable 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement compared to the current benchmarks on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff, respectively. The proposed approach unlocks the potential for unsupervised image segmentation and addresses scalability concerns in real-world scenarios by obviating the need for meticulous parameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

This approach proves advantageous in staving off computational challenges that constitute known hindrances to existing nonparametric quantile regression methods when the number of predictors is much larger than the available sample size. We investigate conditions under which estimation is feasible and of good overall quality and obtain sharp approximations that we employ to devising statistical inference methodology. These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences.

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniST: A Prompt-Empowered Universal Model for Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11838v3)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for informed decision-making, such as transportation management, resource optimization, and urban planning. Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. The implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniST.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing methodologies, often focusing on synchronous BOLD signals from functional MRI (fMRI), may not capture directional influences among brain regions and rarely tackle temporal functional dynamics. In this study, we first construct the brain-effective network via the dynamic causal model. Subsequently, we introduce an interpretable graph learning framework termed Spatio-Temporal Embedding ODE (STE-ODE). This framework incorporates specifically designed directed node embedding layers, aiming at capturing the dynamic interplay between structural and effective networks via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which characterizes spatial-temporal brain dynamics. Our framework is validated on several clinical phenotype prediction tasks using two independent publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks to Simulate Physical Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12868v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to represent and simulate the dynamics of physical systems is a crucial yet challenging task. Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published to the conference of NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Graph Transfer Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12452v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph neural networks have demonstrated efficacy in capturing complex dependencies for urban computing tasks such as forecasting and kriging. However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12377v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is essential in Prognostic Health Management (PHM) for industrial systems. Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p></details> |  |

The co-dynamics can be mediated by immunosuppression or -modulation, shared environmental or climatic drivers, or competition for susceptible hosts. Research and statistical methods in epidemiology often concentrate on large pooled datasets, or high quality data from cities, leaving rural areas underrepresented in literature. Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the US, which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood hematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukemia and lymphoma.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tidy Framework and Infrastructure to Systematically Assemble Spatio-temporal Indexes from Multivariate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05812v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Efficient Spatio-Temporal Lifetime Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06443v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are vital assets for the reliable and efficient operation of power and energy systems. They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Despite significant strides in ST modeling in recent years, there remains a need to emphasize harnessing the potential of information from different modalities. Robust MoST forecasting is more challenging because it possesses (i) high-dimensional and complex internal structures and (ii) dynamic heterogeneity caused by temporal, spatial, and modality variations. In this study, we propose a novel MoST learning framework via Self-Supervised Learning, namely MoSSL, which aims to uncover latent patterns from temporal, spatial, and modality perspectives while quantifying dynamic heterogeneity. Experiment results on two real-world MoST datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

As one of the important application domains of foundation models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture, earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation models. Specifically, for transfer learning of the land cover downstream task on the PhilEO Bench dataset, it shows 10.4\% higher accuracy compared with other geospatial foundation models on average.</p></details> |  |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations, which make it possible to characterize how different types of image transformations interact with each other and the associated spatio-temporal receptive field responses. In this regard, we also extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, to be able to obtain true affine-covariant properties of spatial derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels. The derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. As a side effect, the presented proof for the joint covariance property over the integrated combination of the different geometric image transformations also provides specific proofs for the individual transformation properties, which have not previously been fully reported in the literature. The paper also presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of geometric interpretations of the derived covariance properties, as well as outlines a number of biological interpretations of these results.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 13 figures.

In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p></details> |  |

Our work primarily addresses this, introducing more realistic and flexible models for spatio-temporal random fields. We break away from the traditional confines of the classic frozen field by either relaxing the assumption of a single deterministic velocity or rethinking the hypothesis regarding the spectrum shape, thus enhancing the realism of our models. While the proposed models stand out for their realism and flexibility, they are also paired with simulation algorithms that are equally or less computationally complex than the commonly used circulant embedding for Gaussian random fields in $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. This combination of realistic modeling with efficient simulation methods creates an effective solution for better understanding traveling phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian predictive inference allows for coherently incorporating uncertainty about unknown quantities by making use of methods or models that produce predictive distributions, which in turn inform decision problems. By formalizing these decision problems into properties with the help of spatio-temporal logic, we can formulate and predict how likely such properties are to be satisfied in the future at a certain location. Moreover, we can leverage our methodology to evaluate and compare models directly on their ability to predict the satisfaction of application-driven properties. The approach is illustrated in an urban mobility application, where the crowdedness in the center of Milan is proxied by aggregated mobile phone traffic data. We specify several desirable spatio-temporal properties related to city crowdedness such as a fault-tolerant network or the reachability of hospitals. After verifying these properties on draws from the posterior predictive distributions, we compare several spatio-temporal Bayesian models based on their overall and property-based predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Discriminative Spatio-temporal Representations for Semi-supervised Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16416v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised action recognition aims to improve spatio-temporal reasoning ability with a few labeled data in conjunction with a large amount of unlabeled data. Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone to making ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as the limitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the model two aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporal structure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. It assesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of the labeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from a pseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlight informative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into the short-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of these two new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the model to make accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics400 show the superiority of our method over prior state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, 56 conferences</p></details> |
| **[Mean Estimation with User-Level Privacy for Spatio-Temporal IoT Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15906v7)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the problem of the private release of sample means of speed values from traffic datasets. Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the ACM for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Unified Replay-based Continuous Learning Framework for Spatio-Temporal Prediction on Streaming Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14999v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of wireless and mobile devices results in a proliferation of spatio-temporal data that is used in applications, e.g., traffic prediction, human mobility mining, and air quality prediction, where spatio-temporal prediction is often essential to enable safety, predictability, or reliability. Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[ICST-DNET: An Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network for Traffic Speed Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13853v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[D$^2$ST-Adapter: Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter for Few-shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01431v3)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting large pre-trained image models to few-shot action recognition has proven to be an effective and efficient strategy for learning robust feature extractors, which is essential for few-shot learning. Typical fine-tuning based adaptation paradigm is prone to overfitting in the few-shot learning scenarios and offers little modeling flexibility for learning temporal features in video data. In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), which is a novel adapter tuning framework well-suited for few-shot action recognition due to lightweight design and low parameter-learning overhead. It is designed in a dual-pathway architecture to encode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner. In particular, we devise the anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention module as the core component of D$^2$ST-Adapter, which can be tailored with anisotropic sampling densities along spatial and temporal domains to learn spatial and temporal features specifically in corresponding pathways, allowing our D$^2$ST-Adapter to encode features in a global view in 3D spatio-temporal space while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments with instantiations of our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods for few-shot action recognition. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Joint Analysis of PM2.5 and Ozone in California with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14446v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial threat of concurrent air pollutants to public health is increasingly severe under climate change. To identify the common drivers and extent of spatio-temporal similarity of PM2.5 and ozone, this paper proposed a log Gaussian-Gumbel Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for sharing a SPDE-AR(1) spatio-temporal interaction structure. The proposed model outperforms in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction capacity for its increased parsimony and reduced uncertainty, especially for the shared ozone sub-model. Besides the consistently significant influence of temperature (positive), extreme drought (positive), fire burnt area (positive), and wind speed (negative) on both PM2.5 and ozone, surface pressure and GDP per capita (precipitation) demonstrate only positive associations with PM2.5 (ozone), while population density relates to neither. In addition, our results show the distinct spatio-temporal interactions and different seasonal patterns of PM2.5 and ozone, with peaks of PM2.5 and ozone in cold and hot seasons, respectively. Finally, with the aid of the excursion function, we see that the areas around the intersection of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are likely to exceed the unhealthy ozone level for sensitive groups throughout the year. Our findings provide new insights for regional and seasonal strategies in the co-control of PM2.5 and ozone. Our methodology is expected to be utilized when interest lies in multiple interrelated processes in the fields of environment and epidemiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[DST-GTN: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11996v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for effective urban planning and congestion management. Deep learning (DL) approaches have gained colossal success in traffic forecasting but still face challenges in capturing the intricacies of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we identify and address this challenges by emphasizing that spatial features are inherently dynamic and change over time. A novel in-depth feature representation, called Dynamic Spatio-Temporal (Dyn-ST) features, is introduced, which encapsulates spatial characteristics across varying times. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network (DST-GTN) is proposed by capturing Dyn-ST features and other dynamic adjacency relations between intersections. The DST-GTN can model dynamic ST relationships between nodes accurately and refine the representation of global and local ST characteristics by adopting adaptive weights in low-pass and all-pass filters, enabling the extraction of Dyn-ST features from traffic time-series data. Through numerical experiments on public datasets, the DST-GTN achieves state-of-the-art performance for a range of traffic forecasting tasks and demonstrates enhanced stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal patterns of diurnal temperature: a random matrix approach I-case of India](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11747v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the spatio-temporal gridded daily diurnal temperature range (DTR) data across India during the 72-year period 1951--2022. We augment this data with information on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and on the climatic regions (Stamp's and Koeppen's classification) and four seasons of India. We use various matrix theory approaches to trim out strong but routine signals, random matrix theory to remove noise, and novel empirical generalised singular-value distributions to establish retention of essential signals in the trimmed data. We make use of the spatial Bergsma statistics to measure spatial association and identify temporal change points in the spatial-association. In particular, our investigation captures a yet unknown change-point over the 72 years under study with drastic changes in spatial-association of DTR in India. It also brings out changes in spatial association with regard to ENSO. We conclude that while studying/modelling Indian DTR data, due consideration should be granted to the strong spatial association that is being persistently exhibited over decades, and provision should be kept for potential change points in the temporal behaviour, which in turn can bring moderate to dramatic changes in the spatial association pattern. Some of our analysis also reaffirms the conclusions made by other authors, regarding spatial and temporal behavior of DTR, adding our own insights. We consider the data from the yearly, seasonal and climatic zones points of view, and discover several new and interesting statistical structures which should be of interest, especially to climatologists and statisticians. Our methods are not country specific and could be used profitably for DTR data from other geographical areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervision for LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11737v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular representation learning methods encourage feature invariance under transformations applied at the input. However, in 3D perception tasks like object localization and segmentation, outputs are naturally equivariant to some transformations, such as rotation. Using pre-training loss functions that encourage equivariance of features under certain transformations provides a strong self-supervision signal while also retaining information of geometric relationships between transformed feature representations. This can enable improved performance in downstream tasks that are equivariant to such transformations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal equivariant learning framework by considering both spatial and temporal augmentations jointly. Our experiments show that the best performance arises with a pre-training approach that encourages equivariance to translation, scaling, and flip, rotation and scene flow. For spatial augmentations, we find that depending on the transformation, either a contrastive objective or an equivariance-by-classification objective yields best results. To leverage real-world object deformations and motion, we consider sequential LiDAR scene pairs and develop a novel 3D scene flow-based equivariance objective that leads to improved performance overall. We show our pre-training method for 3D object detection which outperforms existing equivariant and invariant approaches in many settings.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos/code available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatio-temporal model to detect potential outliers in disease mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09882v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal disease mapping models are commonly used to estimate the relative risk of a disease over time and across areas. For each area and time point, the disease count is modelled with a Poisson distribution whose mean is the product of an offset and the disease relative risk. This relative risk is commonly decomposed in the log scale as the sum of fixed and latent effects. The Rushworth model allows for spatio-temporal autocorrelation of the random effects. We build on the Rushworth model to accommodate and identify potentially outlying areas with respect to their disease relative risk evolution, after taking into account the fixed effects. An area may display outlying behaviour at some points in time but not all. At each time point, we assume the latent effects to be spatially structured and include scaling parameters in the precision matrix, to allow for heavy-tails. Two prior specifications are considered for the scaling parameters: one where they are independent across space and one with spatial autocorrelation. We investigate the performance of the different prior specifications of the proposed model through simulation studies and analyse the weekly evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases across the 33 boroughs of Montreal and the 96 French departments during the second wave. In Montreal, 6 boroughs are found to be potentially outlying. In France, the model with spatially structured scaling parameters identified 21 departments as potential outliers. We find that these departments tend to be close to each other and within common French regions.</p></details> |  |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.11% SeK; and on the BDA dataset xBD, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD</p></details> |  |

Addressing this distinctive attribute, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal CNN-Transformer network (MSSTNet). Our approach takes spatial features of different scales extracted by CNN and feeds them into a Multi-scale Embedding Layer (MELayer). The MELayer extracts multi-scale spatial information and encodes these features before sending them into a Temporal Transformer (T-Former). The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |

Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing prescribed spatio-temporal marginals of stopped particles. In the context of control, we seek the control action directing the stochastic flow toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of the framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding control action takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |

However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Federated Learning for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting: A Dual Semantic Alignment-Based Contrastive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03702v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing federated learning (FL) methods for spatio-temporal forecasting fail to capture the inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, which calls for personalized FL (PFL) methods to model the spatio-temporally variant patterns. While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + appendix (21 pages total)</p></details> |

This paper addresses a critical limitation in current video grounding methodologies by introducing an Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task. Unlike prevalent closed-set approaches that struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to limited training data and predefined vocabularies, our model leverages pre-trained representations from foundational spatial grounding models. This empowers it to effectively bridge the semantic gap between natural language and diverse visual content, achieving strong performance in closed-set and open-vocabulary settings. Our contributions include a novel spatio-temporal video grounding model, surpassing state-of-the-art results in closed-set evaluations on multiple datasets and demonstrating superior performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Notably, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in closed-set settings on VidSTG (Declarative and Interrogative) and HC-STVG (V1 and V2) datasets. Furthermore, in open-vocabulary evaluations on HC-STVG V1 and YouCook-Interactions, our model surpasses the recent best-performing models by $4.88$ m_vIoU and $1.83\%$ accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling diverse linguistic and visual concepts for improved video understanding.

These models provide several benefits over other types of generative models due to their training stability, invertibility and efficiency in sampling and inference. This makes them a suitable candidate for stochastic spatio-temporal prediction problems, which are omnipresent in many fields of sciences, such as earth sciences, astrophysics or molecular sciences. In this paper, we present conditional normalizing flows for stochastic spatio-temporal modelling. The method is evaluated on the task of daily temperature and hourly geopotential map prediction from ERA5 datasets.

Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 75.1% on Kinetics-600.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

To correctly exploit the provided information by each sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure. We demonstrate that our approach works on outdoor urban scenes by validating it on multiple established driving datasets. Results show that our method is able to get better accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024.

| **[Spatio-temporal load shifting for truly clean computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00036v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Companies with datacenters are procuring significant amounts of renewable energy to reduce their carbon footprint. There is increasing interest in achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) matching in electricity usage, aiming to eliminate all carbon footprints associated with electricity consumption on an hourly basis. However, the variability of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for achieving this goal. We explore the impact of shifting computing jobs and associated power loads both in time and between datacenter locations. We develop an optimization model to simulate a network of geographically distributed datacenters managed by a company leveraging spatio-temporal load flexibility to achieve 24/7 CFE matching. We isolate three signals relevant for informed use of load flexiblity: varying average quality of renewable energy resources, low correlation between wind power generation over long distances due to different weather conditions, and lags in solar radiation peak due to Earth's rotation. We illustrate that the location of datacenters and the time of year affect which signal drives an effective load-shaping strategy. The energy procurement and load-shifting decisions based on informed use of these signals facilitate the resource-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of clean computing -- the costs of 24/7 CFE are reduced by 1.29$\pm$0.07 EUR/MWh for every additional percentage of flexible load. We provide practical guidelines on how companies with datacenters can leverage spatio-temporal load flexibility for truly clean computing. Our results and the open-source optimization model can also be useful for a broader variety of companies with flexible loads and an interest in eliminating their carbon footprint.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction. The implementation of our approach is available: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GPD.</p></details> |  |

Malicious users can easily create non-existent videos to spread false information. This letter proposes an effective AI-generated video detection (AIGVDet) scheme by capturing the forensic traces with a two-branch spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, two ResNet sub-detectors are learned separately for identifying the anomalies in spatical and optical flow domains, respectively. Results of such sub-detectors are fused to further enhance the discrimination ability. A large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) is constructed as a benchmark for model training and evaluation. Extensive experimental results verify the high generalization and robustness of our AIGVDet scheme. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/multimediaFor/AIGVDet.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is based on learning a 3D spatio-spatial temporal convolution to create detailed pictures of forehead patterns. We introduce a new CNN model called the Forehead Spatio-Spatial Temporal Network (FH-SSTNet), which utilizes a 3D CNN architecture with triplet loss to capture distinguishing features. We enhance the model's discrimination capability using Arcloss in the network's head. Experimentation on the Forehead Creases version 1 (FH-V1) dataset, containing 247 unique subjects, demonstrates the superior performance of FH-SSTNet compared to existing methods and pre-trained CNNs like ResNet50, especially for forehead-based user verification.

The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p></details> | Accepted by FG2024 |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Bi-directional Cross-frame Memory for Distractor Filtering Point Cloud Single Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15831v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D single object tracking within LIDAR point clouds is a pivotal task in computer vision, with profound implications for autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |

PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.</p></details> |  |

But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose a model, Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention ($GRU^{spa}$), where spatial attention layers are integrated into the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Additionally, we utilize containment relationships between different geographic levels (e.g., when a given city block is wholly contained in a given census tract) to constrain the spatial attention layers. For situations where limited historical training data is available, we study transfer learning scenarios and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that $GRU^{spa}$ provides a significant improvement over other neural models as well as typical heuristic methods, allowing us to synthesize realistic point data over small regions useful for training downstream models.</p></details> |  |

Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations.

Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline.</p></details> |  |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |

However, the presence of anomalies can compromise the accuracy and reliability of insights drawn from the collected data or information obtained via statistical analysis. This study aims to develop a robust Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) framework with anomaly detection methods for high-quality data collection. We introduce a general framework that involves anomaly generation, detection and error scoring when searching for an optimal design. This method is demonstrated using two comprehensive simulated case studies: the first study uses a spatial dataset, and the second uses a spatio-temporal river network dataset. As a baseline approach, we employed a commonly used prediction-based utility function based on minimising errors. Results illustrate the trade-off between predictive accuracy and anomaly detection performance for our method under various design scenarios. An optimal design robust to anomalies ensures the collection and analysis of more trustworthy data, playing a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of complex systems such as the environment, therefore enabling informed decisions in monitoring, management, and response.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Occupancy Models with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10680v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern methods for quantifying and predicting species distribution play a crucial part in biodiversity conservation. Occupancy models are a popular choice for analyzing species occurrence data as they allow to separate the observational error induced by imperfect detection, and the sources of bias affecting the occupancy process. However, the spatial and temporal variation in occupancy not accounted for by environmental covariates is often ignored or modelled through simple spatial structures as the computational costs of fitting explicit spatio-temporal models is too high. In this work, we demonstrate how INLA may be used to fit complex occupancy models and how the R-INLA package can provide a user-friendly interface to make such complex models available to users. We show how occupancy models, provided some simplification on the detection process, can be framed as latent Gaussian models and benefit from the powerful INLA machinery. A large selection of complex modelling features, and random effect modelshave already been implemented in R-INLA. These become available for occupancy models, providing the user with an efficient and flexible toolbox. We illustrate how INLA provides a computationally efficient framework for developing and fitting complex occupancy models using two case studies. Through these, we show how different spatio-temporal models that include spatial-varying trends, smooth terms, and spatio-temporal random effects can be fitted. At the cost of limiting the complexity of the detection model, INLA can incorporate a range of complex structures in the process. INLA-based occupancy models provide an alternative framework to fit complex spatiotemporal occupancy models. The need for new and more flexible computationally approaches to fit such models makes INLA an attractive option for addressing complex ecological problems, and a promising area of research.</p></details> |  |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared interactions to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal interactions between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models with flexible shared interaction outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models with independent interactions. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative healthcare districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 39 pages, 12 figures |

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its accurate segmentation and zero-shot generalization, has not yet been tailored for CMR 2D+T segmentation. We therefore introduce CMR2D+T-SAM, a novel approach to adapt SAM for CMR 2D+T segmentation using spatio-temporal adaption. This approach also incorporates a U-Net framework for multi-scale feature extraction, as well as text prompts for accurate segmentation on both short-axis (SAX) and long-axis (LAX) views using a single model. CMR2D+T-SAM outperforms existing deep learning methods on the STACOM2011 dataset, achieving a myocardium Dice score of 0.885 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.900 pixels. It also demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization on the ACDC dataset with a Dice score of 0.840 and a HD of 4.076 pixels.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Autoregressive Queries for Adaptive Tracking with Spatio-TemporalTransformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10574v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rich spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture the complicated target appearance variations in visual tracking. However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal methods for estimating subsurface ocean thermal response to tropical cyclones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15130v5)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tropical cyclones (TCs), driven by heat exchange between the air and sea, pose a substantial risk to many communities around the world. Accurate characterization of the subsurface ocean thermal response to TC passage is crucial for accurate TC intensity forecasts and for an understanding of the role that TCs play in the global climate system. However, that characterization is complicated by the high-noise ocean environment, correlations inherent in spatio-temporal data, relative scarcity of in situ observations, and the entanglement of the TC-induced signal with seasonal signals. We present a general methodological framework that addresses these difficulties, integrating existing techniques in seasonal mean field estimation, Gaussian process modeling, and nonparametric regression into an ANOVA decomposition model. Importantly, we improve upon past work by properly handling seasonality, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification, and treating time as a continuous variable, rather than producing estimates that are binned in time. This ANOVA model is estimated using in situ subsurface temperature profiles from the Argo fleet of autonomous floats through a multi-step procedure, which (1) characterizes the upper ocean seasonal shift during the TC season; (2) models the variability in the temperature observations; (3) fits a thin plate spline using the variability estimates to account for heteroskedasticity and correlation between the observations. This spline fit reveals the ocean thermal response to TC passage. Through this framework, we obtain new scientific insights into the interaction between TCs and the ocean on a global scale, including a three-dimensional characterization of the near-surface and subsurface cooling along the TC storm track and the mixing-induced subsurface warming on the track's right side.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures; supplement and code at https://github.com/huisaddison/tc-ocean-methods</p></details> |

The traditional one-size-fits-all scheme for bitrate ladders is inefficient and reaching the best content-aware decision computationally impractical due to extensive encodings required. To mitigate this, we propose a bitrate and complexity efficient bitrate ladder prediction method using transfer learning and spatio-temporal features. We propose: (1) using feature maps from well-known pre-trained DNNs to predict rate-quality behavior with limited training data; and (2) improving highest quality rung efficiency by predicting minimum bitrate for top quality and using it for the top rung. The method tested on 102 video scenes demonstrates 94.1% reduction in complexity versus brute-force at 1.71% BD-Rate expense.

| **[CINA: Conditional Implicit Neural Atlas for Spatio-Temporal Representation of Fetal Brains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08550v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a conditional implicit neural atlas (CINA) for spatio-temporal atlas generation from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of the neurotypical and pathological fetal brain, that is fully independent of affine or non-rigid registration. During training, CINA learns a general representation of the fetal brain and encodes subject specific information into latent code. After training, CINA can construct a faithful atlas with tissue probability maps of the fetal brain for any gestational age (GA) and anatomical variation covered within the training domain. Thus, CINA is competent to represent both, neurotypical and pathological brains. Furthermore, a trained CINA model can be fit to brain MRI of unseen subjects via test-time optimization of the latent code. CINA can then produce probabilistic tissue maps tailored to a particular subject. We evaluate our method on a total of 198 T2 weighted MRI of normal and abnormal fetal brains from the dHCP and FeTA datasets. We demonstrate CINA's capability to represent a fetal brain atlas that can be flexibly conditioned on GA and on anatomical variations like ventricular volume or degree of cortical folding, making it a suitable tool for modeling both neurotypical and pathological brains. We quantify the fidelity of our atlas by means of tissue segmentation and age prediction and compare it to an established baseline. CINA demonstrates superior accuracy for neurotypical brains and pathological brains with ventriculomegaly. Moreover, CINA scores a mean absolute error of 0.23 weeks in fetal brain age prediction, further confirming an accurate representation of fetal brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[JSTR: Joint Spatio-Temporal Reasoning for Event-based Moving Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07436v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based moving object detection is a challenging task, where static background and moving object are mixed together. Typically, existing methods mainly align the background events to the same spatial coordinate system via motion compensation to distinguish the moving object. However, they neglect the potential spatial tailing effect of moving object events caused by excessive motion, which may affect the structure integrity of the extracted moving object. We discover that the moving object has a complete columnar structure in the point cloud composed of motion-compensated events along the timestamp. Motivated by this, we propose a novel joint spatio-temporal reasoning method for event-based moving object detection. Specifically, we first compensate the motion of background events using inertial measurement unit. In spatial reasoning stage, we project the compensated events into the same image coordinate, discretize the timestamp of events to obtain a time image that can reflect the motion confidence, and further segment the moving object through adaptive threshold on the time image. In temporal reasoning stage, we construct the events into a point cloud along timestamp, and use RANSAC algorithm to extract the columnar shape in the cloud for peeling off the background. Finally, we fuse the results from the two reasoning stages to extract the final moving object region. This joint spatio-temporal reasoning framework can effectively detect the moving object from motion confidence and geometric structure. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to verify that the proposed method can improve the moving object detection accuracy by 13\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimum contrast for the first-order intensity estimation of spatial and spatio-temporal point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04669v2)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we harness a result in point process theory, specifically the expectation of the weighted $K$-function, where the weighting is done by the true first-order intensity function. This theoretical result can be employed as an estimation method to derive parameter estimates for a particular model assumed for the data. The underlying motivation is to avoid the difficulties associated with dealing with complex likelihoods in point process models and their maximization. The exploited result makes our method theoretically applicable to any model specification. In this paper, we restrict our study to Poisson models, whose likelihood represents the base for many more complex point process models. In this context, our proposed method can estimate the vector of local parameters that correspond to the points within the analyzed point pattern without introducing any additional complexity compared to the global estimation. We illustrate the method through simulation studies for both purely spatial and spatio-temporal point processes and show complex scenarios based on the Poisson model through the analysis of two real datasets concerning environmental problems.</p></details> |  |

Tangible cubes, with their rich interaction affordances, high maneuverability, and stable structure, are particularly well-suited for exploring multi-dimensional data types. However, the design potential of these cubes is underexplored. This study introduces a design space for tangible cubes in MR, focusing on interaction space, visualization space, sizes, and multiplicity. Using spatio-temporal data, we explored the interaction affordances of these cubes in a workshop (N=24). We identified unique interactions like rotating, tapping, and stacking, which are linked to augmented reality (AR) visualization commands. Integrating user-identified interactions, we created a design space for tangible-cube interactions and visualization. A prototype visualizing global health spending with small cubes was developed and evaluated, supporting both individual and combined cube manipulation. This research enhances our grasp of tangible interaction in MR, offering insights for future design and application in diverse data contexts.</p></details> |  |

Temporal localization is challenging because it requires robustness, reliability, and accuracy. In this study, we aim to improve the temporal localization and classification accuracy performance by adapting video action recognition and 2D human-pose estimation networks to one model. Therefore, we design a transformer-based fusion architecture to effectively combine 2D-pose features and spatio-temporal features. The model uses 2D-pose features as the positional embedding of the transformer architecture and spatio-temporal features as the main input to the encoder of the transformer. The proposed solution is generic and independent of the camera numbers and positions, giving frame-based class probabilities as output. Finally, the post-processing step combines information from different camera views to obtain final predictions and eliminate false positives. The model performs well on the A2 test set of the 2023 NVIDIA AI City Challenge for naturalistic driving action recognition, achieving the overlap score of the organizer-defined distracted driver behaviour metric of 0.5079.</p></details> |  |

A critical step in creating a closed-loop experiment is real-time inference of neural activity from streaming recordings. One challenging modality for real-time processing is multi-photon calcium imaging (CI). CI enables the recording of activity in large populations of neurons however, often requires batch processing of the video data to extract single-neuron activity from the fluorescence videos. We use the recently proposed robust time-trace estimator-Sparse Emulation of Unused Dictionary Objects (SEUDO) algorithm-as a basis for a new on-line processing algorithm that simultaneously identifies neurons in the fluorescence video and infers their time traces in a way that is robust to as-yet unidentified neurons. To achieve real-time SEUDO (realSEUDO), we optimize the core estimator via both algorithmic improvements and an fast C-based implementation, and create a new cell finding loop to enable realSEUDO to also identify new cells. We demonstrate comparable performance to offline algorithms (e.g., CNMF), and improved performance over the current on-line approach (OnACID) at speeds of 120 Hz on average.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

To address this issue, we introduce SMART, a novel autonomous driving motion generation paradigm that models vectorized map and agent trajectory data into discrete sequence tokens. These tokens are then processed through a decoder-only transformer architecture to train for the next token prediction task across spatial-temporal series. This GPT-style method allows the model to learn the motion distribution in real driving scenarios. SMART achieves state-of-the-art performance across most of the metrics on the generative Sim Agents challenge, ranking 1st on the leaderboards of Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD), demonstrating remarkable inference speed. Moreover, SMART represents the generative model in the autonomous driving motion domain, exhibiting zero-shot generalization capabilities: Using only the NuPlan dataset for training and WOMD for validation, SMART achieved a competitive score of 0.71 on the Sim Agents challenge. Lastly, we have collected over 1 billion motion tokens from multiple datasets, validating the model's scalability. These results suggest that SMART has initially emulated two important properties: scalability and zero-shot generalization, and preliminarily meets the needs of large-scale real-time simulation applications. We have released all the code to promote the exploration of models for motion generation in the autonomous driving field.</p></details> |  |

By integrating textual cues, such as channel descriptions and dynamic news, TGTSF addresses the critical limitations of traditional methods that rely purely on historical data. To support this task, we propose TGForecaster, a robust baseline model that fuses textual cues and time series data using cross-attention mechanisms. We then present four meticulously curated benchmark datasets to validate the proposed framework, ranging from simple periodic data to complex, event-driven fluctuations. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TGForecaster consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the transformative potential of incorporating textual information into time series forecasting. This work not only pioneers a novel forecasting task but also establishes a new benchmark for future research, driving advancements in multimodal data integration for time series models.</p></details> |  |

By retrieving and understanding time series relations, analysts can easily detect anomalies and validate hypotheses in complex time series datasets. However, current relation extraction approaches, including knowledge- and data-driven ones, tend to be laborious and do not support heterogeneous relations. By conducting a formative study with 11 experts, we concluded 6 time series relations, including correlation, causality, similarity, lag, arithmetic, and meta, and summarized three pain points in querying time series involving these relations. We proposed RelaQ, an interactive system that supports the time series query via relation specifications. RelaQ allows users to intuitively specify heterogeneous relations when querying multiple time series, understand the query results based on a scalable, multi-level visualization, and explore possible relations beyond the existing queries. RelaQ is evaluated with two use cases and a user study with 12 participants, showing promising effectiveness and usability.</p></details> |  |

We consider smooth nonconvex finite-sum (empirical risk minimization) problems in this setup and introduce a new parallel method, Freya PAGE, designed to handle arbitrarily heterogeneous and asynchronous computations. By being robust to "stragglers" and adaptively ignoring slow computations, Freya PAGE offers significantly improved time complexity guarantees compared to all previous methods, including Asynchronous SGD, Rennala SGD, SPIDER, and PAGE, while requiring weaker assumptions. The algorithm relies on novel generic stochastic gradient collection strategies with theoretical guarantees that can be of interest on their own, and may be used in the design of future optimization methods. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for smooth nonconvex finite-sum problems in the asynchronous setup, providing a fundamental time complexity limit. This lower bound is tight and demonstrates the optimality of Freya PAGE in the large-scale regime, i.e., when $\sqrt{m} \geq n$, where $n$ is # of workers, and $m$ is # of data samples.</p></details> | 43 pages, 2 figures |

In such games, an efficient NE is defined as the maximizer of the potential function. Existing results are limited to potential games with stringent structural assumptions and entail exponential convergence times in $1/\epsilon$. Unaddressed so far, we tackle general potential games and prove the first finite-time convergence to an $\epsilon$-efficient NE. In particular, by using a problem-dependent analysis, our bound depends polynomially on $1/\epsilon$. Furthermore, we provide two extensions of our convergence result: first, we show that a variant of log-linear learning that requires a factor $A$ less feedback on the utility per round enjoys a similar convergence time; second, we demonstrate the robustness of our convergence guarantee if log-linear learning is subject to small perturbations such as alterations in the learning rule or noise-corrupted utilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 mai...</summary><p>9 main pages, 25 pages, 1 Table</p></details> |

The main novelties compared to previous works are two. First, the proposed framework relies only on measured input-output trajectories from the system and no internal (state) information is required. Second, our system representation makes use of exact system trajectories, without resorting to orthogonal bases representations and consequent approximations. We first establish sufficient and necessary conditions for data-based generation of system trajectories in terms of suitable latent variables. Subsequently, we reformulate these conditions using measured input-output data and show how to span the full behavior of the system. Furthermore, we show how to use the developed framework to solve the data-based continuous-time simulation problem.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Our motivation comes from the important areas of predicting mortality and phenotyping where using different modalities of data could significantly improve our ability to predict. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a new method that uses two separate encoders, one for each type of data, allowing the model to understand complex patterns in both visual and time-based information. Apart from the technical challenges, our goal is to make the predictive model more robust in noisy conditions and perform better than current methods. We also deal with imbalanced datasets and use an uncertainty loss function, yielding improved results while simultaneously providing a principled means of modeling uncertainty. Additionally, we include attention mechanisms to fuse different modalities, allowing the model to focus on what's important for each task. We tested our approach using the comprehensive multimodal MIMIC dataset, combining MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-CXR datasets. Our experiments show that our method is effective in improving multimodal deep learning for clinical applications. The code will be made available online.</p></details> |  |

Previous works demonstrated convergence to a Nash equilibrium in this setting using double time-scale algorithms under strong reachability assumptions. We address the open problem of achieving an approximate Nash equilibrium efficiently with an uncoupled and single time-scale algorithm under weaker conditions. Our contribution is a rational and convergent algorithm, utilizing Tsallis-entropy regularization in a value-iteration-based approach. The algorithm learns an approximate Nash equilibrium in polynomial time, requiring only the existence of a policy pair that induces an irreducible and aperiodic Markov chain, thus considerably weakening past assumptions. Our analysis leverages negative drift inequalities and introduces novel properties of Tsallis entropy that are of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2303.03100 by other authors</p></details> |

Traditional TSAD models, which often rely on deep learning, require extensive training data and operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability for detected anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose LLMAD, a novel TSAD method that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver accurate and interpretable TSAD results. LLMAD innovatively applies LLMs for in-context anomaly detection by retrieving both positive and negative similar time series segments, significantly enhancing LLMs' effectiveness. Furthermore, LLMAD employs the Anomaly Detection Chain-of-Thought (AnoCoT) approach to mimic expert logic for its decision-making process. This method further enhances its performance and enables LLMAD to provide explanations for their detections through versatile perspectives, which are particularly important for user decision-making. Experiments on three datasets indicate that our LLMAD achieves detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning methods while offering remarkable interpretability for detections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that directly employs LLMs for TSAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding-time Realignment of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02992v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning language models with human preferences is crucial for reducing errors and biases in these models. Alignment techniques, such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), are typically cast as optimizing a tradeoff between human preference rewards and a proximity regularization term that encourages staying close to the unaligned model. Selecting an appropriate level of regularization is critical: insufficient regularization can lead to reduced model capabilities due to reward hacking, whereas excessive regularization hinders alignment. Traditional methods for finding the optimal regularization level require retraining multiple models with varying regularization strengths. This process, however, is resource-intensive, especially for large models. To address this challenge, we propose decoding-time realignment (DeRa), a simple method to explore and evaluate different regularization strengths in aligned models without retraining. DeRa enables control over the degree of alignment, allowing users to smoothly transition between unaligned and aligned models. It also enhances the efficiency of hyperparameter tuning by enabling the identification of effective regularization strengths using a validation dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Models for time series imputation often require specialization, necessitating distinct designs for different domains and missing patterns. In this study, we introduce NuwaTS, a framework to repurpose Pre-trained Language Model (PLM) for general time series imputation. Once trained, this model can be applied to imputation tasks on incomplete time series from any domain with any missing patterns. We begin by devising specific embeddings for each sub-series patch of the incomplete time series. These embeddings encapsulate information about the patch itself, the missing data patterns within the patch, and the patch's statistical characteristics. To enhance the model's adaptability to different missing patterns, we propose a contrastive learning approach to make representations of the same patch more similar across different missing patterns. By combining this contrastive loss with the missing data imputation task, we train PLMs to obtain a one-for-all imputation model. Furthermore, we utilize a plug-and-play layer-wise fine-tuning approach to train domain-specific models. Experimental results demonstrate that leveraging a dataset of over seventeen million time series from diverse domains, we obtain a one-for-all imputation model which outperforms existing domain-specific models across various datasets and missing patterns. Additionally, we find that NuwaTS can be generalized to other time series tasks such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |

Existing methods require training one specific model for each dataset, which exhibits limited generalization capability across different target datasets, hindering anomaly detection performance in various scenarios with scarce training data. Aiming at this problem, we propose constructing a general time series anomaly detection model, which is pre-trained on extensive multi-domain datasets and can subsequently apply to a multitude of downstream scenarios. The significant divergence of time series data across different domains presents two primary challenges in building such a general model: (1) meeting the diverse requirements of appropriate information bottlenecks tailored to different datasets in one unified model, and (2) enabling distinguishment between multiple normal and abnormal patterns, both are crucial for effective anomaly detection in various target scenarios. To tackle these two challenges, we propose a General time series anomaly Detector with Adaptive Bottlenecks and Dual Adversarial Decoders (DADA), which enables flexible selection of bottlenecks based on different data and explicitly enhances clear differentiation between normal and abnormal series. We conduct extensive experiments on nine target datasets from different domains. After pre-training on multi-domain data, DADA, serving as a zero-shot anomaly detector for these datasets, still achieves competitive or even superior results compared to those models tailored to each specific dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[BDetCLIP: Multimodal Prompting Contrastive Test-Time Backdoor Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15269v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal contrastive learning methods (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive zero-shot classification performance due to their strong ability to joint representation learning for visual and textual modalities. However, recent research revealed that multimodal contrastive learning on poisoned pre-training data with a small proportion of maliciously backdoored data can induce backdoored CLIP that could be attacked by inserted triggers in downstream tasks with a high success rate. To defend against backdoor attacks on CLIP, existing defense methods focus on either the pre-training stage or the fine-tuning stage, which would unfortunately cause high computational costs due to numerous parameter updates. In this paper, we provide the first attempt at a computationally efficient backdoor detection method to defend against backdoored CLIP in the inference stage. We empirically find that the visual representations of backdoored images are insensitive to both benign and malignant changes in class description texts. Motivated by this observation, we propose BDetCLIP, a novel test-time backdoor detection method based on contrastive prompting. Specifically, we first prompt the language model (e.g., GPT-4) to produce class-related description texts (benign) and class-perturbed random texts (malignant) by specially designed instructions. Then, the distribution difference in cosine similarity between images and the two types of class description texts can be used as the criterion to detect backdoor samples. Extensive experiments validate that our proposed BDetCLIP is superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detection methods, in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[FTMixer: Frequency and Time Domain Representations Fusion for Time Series Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15256v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data can be represented in both the time and frequency domains, with the time domain emphasizing local dependencies and the frequency domain highlighting global dependencies. To harness the strengths of both domains in capturing local and global dependencies, we propose the Frequency and Time Domain Mixer (FTMixer). To exploit the global characteristics of the frequency domain, we introduce the Frequency Channel Convolution (FCC) module, designed to capture global inter-series dependencies. Inspired by the windowing concept in frequency domain transformations, we present the Windowing Frequency Convolution (WFC) module to capture local dependencies. The WFC module first applies frequency transformation within each window, followed by convolution across windows. Furthermore, to better capture these local dependencies, we employ channel-independent scheme to mix the time domain and frequency domain patches. Notably, FTMixer employs the Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) with real numbers instead of the complex-number-based Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT), enabling direct utilization of modern deep learning operators in the frequency domain. Extensive experimental results across seven real-world long-term time series datasets demonstrate the superiority of FTMixer, in terms of both forecasting performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Strong historical necessity is motivated from a linguistical perspective, and an example of it is ``If I had not gotten away, I must have been dead''. The approach of the logic is as follows. The agent accepts ontic rules concerning how the world evolves over time. She takes some rules as indefeasible, which determine acceptable timelines. When evaluating a sentence with conditional strong historical necessity, we introduce its antecedent as an indefeasible ontic rule and then check whether its consequent holds for all acceptable timelines. The argument is not sound by the logic.</p></details> |  |

However, existing graph data structures cannot simultaneously address the performance bottlenecks caused by the dynamic updates, large scale, and high query complexity of current graphs. This paper proposes a novel data structure for large-scale dynamic graphs called CuckooGraph. It does not need to know the amount of graph data in advance, and can adaptively resize to the most memory-efficient form according to the data scale, realizing multiple graph analytic tasks faster. The key techniques of CuckooGraph include TRANSFORMATION and DENYLIST. TRANSFORMATION fully utilizes the limited memory by designing related data structures that allow flexible space transformations to smoothly expand/tighten the required space depending on the number of incoming items. DENYLIST efficiently handles item insertion failures and further improves processing speed. We conduct extensive experiments, and the results show that CuckooGraph significantly reduces query time by four orders of magnitude on 1-hop successor and precursor queries compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timely Fusion of Surround Radar/Lidar for Object Detection in Autonomous Driving Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04806v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fusing Radar and Lidar sensor data can fully utilize their complementary advantages and provide more accurate reconstruction of the surrounding for autonomous driving systems. Surround Radar/Lidar can provide 360-degree view sampling with the minimal cost, which are promising sensing hardware solutions for autonomous driving systems. However, due to the intrinsic physical constraints, the rotating speed of surround Radar, and thus the frequency to generate Radar data frames, is much lower than surround Lidar. Existing Radar/Lidar fusion methods have to work at the low frequency of surround Radar, which cannot meet the high responsiveness requirement of autonomous driving systems.This paper develops techniques to fuse surround Radar/Lidar with working frequency only limited by the faster surround Lidar instead of the slower surround Radar, based on the state-of-the-art object detection model MVDNet. The basic idea of our approach is simple: we let MVDNet work with temporally unaligned data from Radar/Lidar, so that fusion can take place at any time when a new Lidar data frame arrives, instead of waiting for the slow Radar data frame. However, directly applying MVDNet to temporally unaligned Radar/Lidar data greatly degrades its object detection accuracy. The key information revealed in this paper is that we can achieve high output frequency with little accuracy loss by enhancing the training procedure to explore the temporal redundancy in MVDNet so that it can tolerate the temporal unalignment of input data. We explore several different ways of training enhancement and compare them quantitatively with experiments.</p></details> |  |

Maximal length orientable sequences are known only for $n\leq 7$, and a trivial upper bound on their length is $2^{n-1} - 2^{\lfloor(n-1)/2\rfloor}$. This paper presents the first efficient algorithm to construct orientable sequences with asymptotically optimal length; more specifically, our algorithm constructs orientable sequences via cycle-joining and a successor-rule approach requiring $O(n)$ time per bit and $O(n)$ space. This answers a longstanding open question from Dai, Martin, Robshaw, Wild [Cryptography and Coding III (1993)]. Applying a recent concatenation-tree framework, the same sequences can be generated in $O(1)$-amortized time per bit using $O(n^2)$ space. Our sequences are applied to find new longest-known (aperiodic) orientable sequences for $n\leq 20$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parsimony or Capability? Decomposition Delivers Both in Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11929v3)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) represents a critical frontier in time series analysis, characterized by extensive input sequences, as opposed to the shorter spans typical of traditional approaches. While longer sequences inherently offer richer information for enhanced predictive precision, prevailing studies often respond by escalating model complexity. These intricate models can inflate into millions of parameters, resulting in prohibitive parameter scales. Our study demonstrates, through both analytical and empirical evidence, that decomposition is key to containing excessive model inflation while achieving uniformly superior and robust results across various datasets. Remarkably, by tailoring decomposition to the intrinsic dynamics of time series data, our proposed model outperforms existing benchmarks, using over 99 \% fewer parameters than the majority of competing methods. Through this work, we aim to unleash the power of a restricted set of parameters by capitalizing on domain characteristics--a timely reminder that in the realm of LTSF, bigger is not invariably better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Law for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15124v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling law that rewards large datasets, complex models and enhanced data granularity has been observed in various fields of deep learning. Yet, studies on time series forecasting have cast doubt on scaling behaviors of deep learning methods for time series forecasting: while more training data improves performance, more capable models do not always outperform less capable models, and longer input horizons may hurt performance for some models. We propose a theory for scaling law for time series forecasting that can explain these seemingly abnormal behaviors. We take into account the impact of dataset size and model complexity, as well as time series data granularity, particularly focusing on the look-back horizon, an aspect that has been unexplored in previous theories. Furthermore, we empirically evaluate various models using a diverse set of time series forecasting datasets, which (1) verifies the validity of scaling law on dataset size and model complexity within the realm of time series forecasting, and (2) validates our theoretical framework, particularly regarding the influence of look back horizon. We hope our findings may inspire new models targeting time series forecasting datasets of limited size, as well as large foundational datasets and models for time series forecasting in future works.\footnote{Codes for our experiments will be made public at: \url{https://github.com/JingzheShi/ScalingLawForTimeSeriesForecasting}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Future Change-points in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09485v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change-point detection and estimation procedures have been widely developed in the literature. However, commonly used approaches in change-point analysis have mainly been focusing on detecting change-points within an entire time series (off-line methods), or quickest detection of change-points in sequentially observed data (on-line methods). Both classes of methods are concerned with change-points that have already occurred. The arguably more important question of when future change-points may occur, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we develop a novel statistical model that describes the mechanism of change-point occurrence. Specifically, the model assumes a latent process in the form of a random walk driven by non-negative innovations, and an observed process which behaves differently when the latent process belongs to different regimes. By construction, an occurrence of a change-point is equivalent to hitting a regime threshold by the latent process. Therefore, by predicting when the latent process will hit the next regime threshold, future change-points can be forecasted. The probabilistic properties of the model such as stationarity and ergodicity are established. A composite likelihood-based approach is developed for parameter estimation and model selection. Moreover, we construct the predictor and prediction interval for future change points based on the estimated model.</p></details> | 37 pages, 4 figures |

Existing research has identified a clear divide in methodologies for learning mixtures of discrete and continuous-time Markov chains, while the latter presents additional complexities for recovery accuracy and efficiency. We introduce a unifying strategy for learning mixtures of discrete and continuous-time Markov chains, focusing on hitting times, which are well defined for both types. Specifically, we design a reconstruction algorithm that outputs a mixture which accurately reflects the estimated hitting times and demonstrates resilience to noise. We introduce an efficient gradient-descent approach, specifically tailored to manage the computational complexity and non-symmetric characteristics inherent in the calculation of hitting time derivatives. Our approach is also of significant interest when applied to a single Markov chain, thus extending the methodologies previously established by Hoskins et al. and Wittmann et al. We complement our theoretical work with experiments conducted on synthetic and real-world datasets, providing a comprehensive evaluation of our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[GOTCHA: Real-Time Video Deepfake Detection via Challenge-Response](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.06186v4)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of AI-enabled Real-Time Deepfakes (RTDFs), the integrity of online video interactions has become a growing concern. RTDFs have now made it feasible to replace an imposter's face with their victim in live video interactions. Such advancement in deepfakes also coaxes detection to rise to the same standard. However, existing deepfake detection techniques are asynchronous and hence ill-suited for RTDFs. To bridge this gap, we propose a challenge-response approach that establishes authenticity in live settings. We focus on talking-head style video interaction and present a taxonomy of challenges that specifically target inherent limitations of RTDF generation pipelines. We evaluate representative examples from the taxonomy by collecting a unique dataset comprising eight challenges, which consistently and visibly degrades the quality of state-of-the-art deepfake generators. These results are corroborated both by humans and a new automated scoring function, leading to 88.6% and 80.1% AUC, respectively. The findings underscore the promising potential of challenge-response systems for explainable and scalable real-time deepfake detection in practical scenarios.

To fully utilize the in-context capabilities in time series forecasting (TSF) problems, unlike previous Transformer-based or LLM-based time series forecasting methods, we reformulate "time series forecasting tasks" as input tokens by constructing a series of (lookback, future) pairs within the tokens. This method aligns more closely with the inherent in-context mechanisms, and is more parameter-efficient without the need of using pre-trained LLM parameters. Furthermore, it addresses issues such as overfitting in existing Transformer-based TSF models, consistently achieving better performance across full-data, few-shot, and zero-shot settings compared to previous architectures.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, we introduce a notion of feasible points, demonstrating that their existence is sufficient to characterize robust controlled invariants for the considered class of systems. The study further investigates the necessity of reducing the feasibility condition for CSM and Lipschitz systems, unveiling conditions that guide this reduction.

For forecasting problems in supervised learning, most CP methods focus on building prediction intervals for univariate responses. In this work, we develop a sequential CP method called $\texttt{MultiDimSPCI}$ that builds prediction $\textit{regions}$ for a multivariate response, especially in the context of multivariate time series, which are not exchangeable. Theoretically, we estimate $\textit{finite-sample}$ high-probability bounds on the conditional coverage gap.

| **[Large language models can be zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14755v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the use of large language models (LLMs) for this task. However, LLMs typically handle one-dimensional data. We introduce MultiCast, a zero-shot LLM-based approach for multivariate time series forecasting. It allows LLMs to receive multivariate time series as input, through three novel token multiplexing solutions that effectively reduce dimensionality while preserving key repetitive patterns. Additionally, a quantization scheme helps LLMs to better learn these patterns, while significantly reducing token use for practical applications. We showcase the performance of our approach in terms of RMSE and execution time against state-of-the-art approaches on three real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14616v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShapeFormer: Shapelet Transformer for Multivariate Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14608v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series classification (MTSC) has attracted significant research attention due to its diverse real-world applications. Recently, exploiting transformers for MTSC has achieved state-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods focus on generic features, providing a comprehensive understanding of data, but they ignore class-specific features crucial for learning the representative characteristics of each class. This leads to poor performance in the case of imbalanced datasets or datasets with similar overall patterns but differing in minor class-specific details. In this paper, we propose a novel Shapelet Transformer (ShapeFormer), which comprises class-specific and generic transformer modules to capture both of these features. In the class-specific module, we introduce the discovery method to extract the discriminative subsequences of each class (i.e. shapelets) from the training set. We then propose a Shapelet Filter to learn the difference features between these shapelets and the input time series. We found that the difference feature for each shapelet contains important class-specific features, as it shows a significant distinction between its class and others. In the generic module, convolution filters are used to extract generic features that contain information to distinguish among all classes. For each module, we employ the transformer encoder to capture the correlation between their features. As a result, the combination of two transformer modules allows our model to exploit the power of both types of features, thereby enhancing the classification performance. Our experiments on 30 UEA MTSC datasets demonstrate that ShapeFormer has achieved the highest accuracy ranking compared to state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Controllable Continual Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14602v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) is an emerging and challenging task where a model trained in a source domain must adapt to continuously changing conditions during testing, without access to the original source data. CTTA is prone to error accumulation due to uncontrollable domain shifts, leading to blurred decision boundaries between categories. Existing CTTA methods primarily focus on suppressing domain shifts, which proves inadequate during the unsupervised test phase. In contrast, we introduce a novel approach that guides rather than suppresses these shifts. Specifically, we propose $\textbf{C}$ontrollable $\textbf{Co}$ntinual $\textbf{T}$est-$\textbf{T}$ime $\textbf{A}$daptation (C-CoTTA), which explicitly prevents any single category from encroaching on others, thereby mitigating the mutual influence between categories caused by uncontrollable shifts. Moreover, our method reduces the sensitivity of model to domain transformations, thereby minimizing the magnitude of category shifts. Extensive quantitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, while qualitative analyses, such as t-SNE plots, confirm the theoretical validity of our approach.</p></details> |  |

This design captures and utilizes temporal dependencies, significantly enhancing the generative capabilities of SNNs. Neuroscientific research has identified hippocampal "time cells" that fire sequentially during temporally structured experiences. Our temporal codebook emulates this behavior by triggering the activation of time cell populations based on similarity measures as input stimuli pass through it. We conducted extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CelebA, and downsampled LSUN Bedroom, to validate our model's performance. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the temporal codebook on neuromorphic datasets NMNIST and DVS-CIFAR10, and demonstrated the model's capability with high-resolution datasets such as CelebA-HQ, LSUN Bedroom, and LSUN Church. The experimental results indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing SNN-based generative models across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our approach excels in generating high-resolution and temporally consistent data, underscoring the crucial role of temporal information in SNN-based generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have explored the architectural designs, optimization objectives, data augmentation strategies, and others for YOLOs, achieving notable progress. However, the reliance on the non-maximum suppression (NMS) for post-processing hampers the end-to-end deployment of YOLOs and adversely impacts the inference latency. Besides, the design of various components in YOLOs lacks the comprehensive and thorough inspection, resulting in noticeable computational redundancy and limiting the model's capability. It renders the suboptimal efficiency, along with considerable potential for performance improvements. In this work, we aim to further advance the performance-efficiency boundary of YOLOs from both the post-processing and model architecture. To this end, we first present the consistent dual assignments for NMS-free training of YOLOs, which brings competitive performance and low inference latency simultaneously. Moreover, we introduce the holistic efficiency-accuracy driven model design strategy for YOLOs. We comprehensively optimize various components of YOLOs from both efficiency and accuracy perspectives, which greatly reduces the computational overhead and enhances the capability. The outcome of our effort is a new generation of YOLO series for real-time end-to-end object detection, dubbed YOLOv10. Extensive experiments show that YOLOv10 achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency across various model scales. For example, our YOLOv10-S is 1.8$\times$ faster than RT-DETR-R18 under the similar AP on COCO, meanwhile enjoying 2.8$\times$ smaller number of parameters and FLOPs. Compared with YOLOv9-C, YOLOv10-B has 46\% less latency and 25\% fewer parameters for the same performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/THU-MIG/yolov10</p></details> |

The controller is defined as a linear state-feedback law whose gain is adapted to the plant changes through a data-based event-triggering rule. To do so, we monitor the evolution of a data-based Lyapunov function along the solution. When this Lyapunov function does not satisfy a designed desirable condition, an episode is triggered to update the controller gain and the corresponding Lyapunov function using the last collected data. The resulting closed-loop dynamics hence exhibits both physical jumps, due to the system dynamics, and episodic jumps, which naturally leads to a hybrid discrete-time system. We leverage the inherent robustness of the controller and provide general conditions under which various stability notions can be established for the system. Two notable cases where these conditions are satisfied are treated, and numerical results illustrating the relevance of the approach are discussed.</p></details> |  |

TTA methods leverage unlabeled data at test time to adapt to distribution shifts. Although many effective methods have been proposed, their impressive performance usually comes at the cost of significantly increased computation budgets. Current evaluation protocols overlook the effect of this extra computation cost, affecting their real-world applicability. To address this issue, we propose a more realistic evaluation protocol for TTA methods, where data is received in an online fashion from a constant-speed data stream, thereby accounting for the method's adaptation speed. We apply our proposed protocol to benchmark several TTA methods on multiple datasets and scenarios. Extensive experiments show that, when accounting for inference speed, simple and fast approaches can outperform more sophisticated but slower methods. For example, SHOT from 2020, outperforms the state-of-the-art method SAR from 2023 in this setting. Our results reveal the importance of developing practical TTA methods that are both accurate and efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICML 2024</p></details> |

The benefits of the proposed formulation are the ability to handle large displacements of explicitly represented domain boundaries without generating body-fitted meshes and remeshing techniques. For the space discretization, we use a background mesh and an unfitted method that relies on integration on cut cells only. We perform this intersection by using clipping algorithms. To deal with the mesh movement, we pullback the equations to a reference configuration (the spatial mesh at the initial time slab times the time interval) that is constant in time. This way, the geometrical intersection algorithm is only required in 3D, another key property of the proposed scheme. At the end of the time slab, we compute the deformed mesh, intersect the deformed boundary with the background mesh, and consider an exact transfer operator between meshes to compute jump terms in the time discontinuous Galerkin integration. The transfer is also computed using geometrical intersection algorithms. We demonstrate the applicability of the method to fluid problems around rotating (2D and 3D) geometries described by oriented boundary meshes. We also provide a set of numerical experiments that show the optimal convergence of the method.</p></details> |  |

To integrate volatile renewable sources, energy systems require grid expansion, storage capabilities, or flexible consumption. This study focuses on industries adjusting production to real-time energy markets, offering flexible consumption to the grid. Flexible production considers not only traditional goals like minimizing production time but also minimizing energy costs and emissions, thereby enhancing the sustainability of businesses. However, existing research focuses on single goals, neglects the combination of makespan, energy costs and emissions, or assumes constant or periodic tariffs instead of a dynamic energy market. We present a novel memetic NSGA-III to minimize makespan, energy cost, and emissions, integrating real energy market data, and allowing manufacturers to adapt consumption to current grid conditions. Evaluating it with benchmark instances from literature and real energy market data, we explore the trade-offs between objectives, showcasing potential savings in energy costs and emissions on estimated Pareto fronts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-FFM: Towards LM-Empowered Federated Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14252v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike natural language processing and computer vision, the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting is blocked due to data scarcity. While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Poisson-Gamma Dynamic Factor Model with Time-Varying Transition Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16297v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic approaches for handling count-valued time sequences have attracted amounts of research attentions because their ability to infer explainable latent structures and to estimate uncertainties, and thus are especially suitable for dealing with \emph{noisy} and \emph{incomplete} count data. Among these models, Poisson-Gamma Dynamical Systems (PGDSs) are proven to be effective in capturing the evolving dynamics underlying observed count sequences. However, the state-of-the-art PGDS still fails to capture the \emph{time-varying} transition dynamics that are commonly observed in real-world count time sequences. To mitigate this gap, a non-stationary PGDS is proposed to allow the underlying transition matrices to evolve over time, and the evolving transition matrices are modeled by sophisticatedly-designed Dirichlet Markov chains. Leveraging Dirichlet-Multinomial-Beta data augmentation techniques, a fully-conjugate and efficient Gibbs sampler is developed to perform posterior simulation. Experiments show that, in comparison with related models, the proposed non-stationary PGDS achieves improved predictive performance due to its capacity to learn non-stationary dependency structure captured by the time-evolving transition matrices.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronosLex: Time-aware Incremental Training for Temporal Generalization of Legal Classification Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14211v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of legal multi-label text classification tasks, where legal concepts evolve over time. Existing models often overlook the temporal dimension in their training process, leading to suboptimal performance of those models over time, as they treat training data as a single homogeneous block. To address this, we introduce ChronosLex, an incremental training paradigm that trains models on chronological splits, preserving the temporal order of the data. However, this incremental approach raises concerns about overfitting to recent data, prompting an assessment of mitigation strategies using continual learning and temporal invariant methods. Our experimental results over six legal multi-label text classification datasets reveal that continual learning methods prove effective in preventing overfitting thereby enhancing temporal generalizability, while temporal invariant methods struggle to capture these dynamics of temporal shifts.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |
| **[Deterministic Policies for Constrained Reinforcement Learning in Polynomial-Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14183v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel algorithm that efficiently computes near-optimal deterministic policies for constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) problems. Our approach combines three key ideas: (1) value-demand augmentation, (2) action-space approximate dynamic programming, and (3) time-space rounding. Under mild reward assumptions, our algorithm constitutes a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for a diverse class of cost criteria. This class requires that the cost of a policy can be computed recursively over both time and (state) space, which includes classical expectation, almost sure, and anytime constraints. Our work not only provides provably efficient algorithms to address real-world challenges in decision-making but also offers a unifying theory for the efficient computation of constrained deterministic policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[CALF: Aligning LLMs for Time Series Forecasting via Cross-modal Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07300v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (e.g., Transformer) has been widely and successfully used in multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF). Unlike existing methods that focus on training models from a single modal of time series input, large language models (LLMs) based MTSF methods with cross-modal text and time series input have recently shown great superiority, especially with limited temporal data. However, current LLM-based MTSF methods usually focus on adapting and fine-tuning LLMs, while neglecting the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal input tokens, thus leading to sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Cross-Modal LLM Fine-Tuning (CALF) framework for MTSF by reducing the distribution discrepancy between textual and temporal data, which mainly consists of the temporal target branch with temporal input and the textual source branch with aligned textual input. To reduce the distribution discrepancy, we develop the cross-modal match module to first align cross-modal input distributions. Additionally, to minimize the modality distribution gap in both feature and output spaces, feature regularization loss is developed to align the intermediate features between the two branches for better weight updates, while output consistency loss is introduced to allow the output representations of both branches to correspond effectively. Thanks to the modality alignment, CALF establishes state-of-the-art performance for both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with low computational complexity, and exhibiting favorable few-shot and zero-shot abilities similar to that in LLMs. Code is available at \url{https://github.com/Hank0626/LLaTA}.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Disappearance of Timestep Embedding in Modern Time-Dependent Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14126v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamical systems are often time-varying, whose modeling requires a function that evolves with respect to time. Recent studies such as the neural ordinary differential equation proposed a time-dependent neural network, which provides a neural network varying with respect to time. However, we claim that the architectural choice to build a time-dependent neural network significantly affects its time-awareness but still lacks sufficient validation in its current states. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the architecture of modern time-dependent neural networks. Here, we report a vulnerability of vanishing timestep embedding, which disables the time-awareness of a time-dependent neural network. Furthermore, we find that this vulnerability can also be observed in diffusion models because they employ a similar architecture that incorporates timestep embedding to discriminate between different timesteps during a diffusion process. Our analysis provides a detailed description of this phenomenon as well as several solutions to address the root cause. Through experiments on neural ordinary differential equations and diffusion models, we observed that ensuring alive time-awareness via proposed solutions boosted their performance, which implies that their current implementations lack sufficient time-dependency.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[AutoTimes: Autoregressive Time Series Forecasters via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02370v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models of time series have not been fully developed due to the limited availability of time series corpora and the underexploration of scalable pre-training. Based on the similar sequential formulation of time series and natural language, increasing research demonstrates the feasibility of leveraging large language models (LLM) for time series. Nevertheless, the inherent autoregressive property and decoder-only architecture of LLMs have not been fully considered, resulting in insufficient utilization of LLM abilities. To further exploit the general-purpose token transition and multi-step generation ability of large language models, we propose AutoTimes to repurpose LLMs as autoregressive time series forecasters, which independently projects time series segments into the embedding space and autoregressively generates future predictions with arbitrary lengths. Compatible with any decoder-only LLMs, the consequent forecaster exhibits the flexibility of the lookback length and scalability of the LLM size. Further, we formulate time series as prompts, extending the context for prediction beyond the lookback window, termed in-context forecasting. By adopting textual timestamps as position embeddings, AutoTimes integrates multimodality for multivariate scenarios. Empirically, AutoTimes achieves state-of-the-art with 0.1% trainable parameters and over 5 times training/inference speedup compared to advanced LLM-based forecasters.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we consider a distributed Q-learning scenario, wherein a number of agents cooperatively solve a sequential decision making problem without access to the central reward function which is an average of the local rewards. In particular, we study finite-time analysis of a distributed Q-learning algorithm, and provide a new sample complexity result of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \min\left\{\frac{1}{\epsilon^2}\frac{t_{\text{mix}}}{(1-\gamma)^6 d_{\min}^4 } ,\frac{1}{\epsilon}\frac{\sqrt{|\gS||\gA|}}{(1-\sigma_2(\boldsymbol{W}))(1-\gamma)^4 d_{\min}^3} \right\}\right)$ under tabular lookup</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study of Posterior Stability for Time-Series Latent Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14021v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion has shown promising results in image generation and permits efficient sampling. However, this framework might suffer from the problem of posterior collapse when applied to time series. In this paper, we conduct an impact analysis of this problem. With a theoretical insight, we first explain that posterior collapse reduces latent diffusion to a VAE, making it less expressive. Then, we introduce the notion of dependency measures, showing that the latent variable sampled from the diffusion model loses control of the generation process in this situation and that latent diffusion exhibits dependency illusion in the case of shuffled time series. We also analyze the causes of posterior collapse and introduce a new framework based on this analysis, which addresses the problem and supports a more expressive prior distribution. Our experiments on various real-world time-series datasets demonstrate that our new model maintains a stable posterior and outperforms the baselines in time series generation.</p></details> | Paper under review |
| **[DyGPrompt: Learning Feature and Time Prompts on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13937v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs are pervasive in the real world, modeling dynamic relations between objects across various fields. For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique, which are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs. However, existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DyGPrompt, a novel pre-training and prompting framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and dynamic variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DyGPrompt through extensive experiments on three public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

Time series forecasting shares a similar sequential structure to language, and is amenable to large-scale transformer architectures. Here we show that foundational decoder-only time series transformer models exhibit analogous scaling-behavior to LLMs, while architectural details (aspect ratio and number of heads) have a minimal effect over broad ranges. We assemble a large corpus of heterogenous time series data on which to train, and establish, for the first time, power-law scaling relations with respect to parameter count, dataset size, and training compute, spanning five orders of magnitude.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Predicting long time contributors with knowledge units of programming languages: an empirical study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13852v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting potential long-time contributors (LTCs) early allows project maintainers to effectively allocate resources and mentoring to enhance their development and retention. Mapping programming language expertise to developers and characterizing projects in terms of how they use programming languages can help identify developers who are more likely to become LTCs. However, prior studies on predicting LTCs do not consider programming language skills. This paper reports an empirical study on the usage of knowledge units (KUs) of the Java programming language to predict LTCs. A KU is a cohesive set of key capabilities that are offered by one or more building blocks of a given programming language. We build a prediction model called KULTC, which leverages KU-based features along five different dimensions. We detect and analyze KUs from the studied 75 Java projects (353K commits and 168K pull requests) as well as 4,219 other Java projects in which the studied developers previously worked (1.7M commits). We compare the performance of KULTC with the state-of-the-art model, which we call BAOLTC. Even though KULTC focuses exclusively on the programming language perspective, KULTC achieves a median AUC of at least 0.75 and significantly outperforms BAOLTC. Combining the features of KULTC with the features of BAOLTC results in an enhanced model (KULTC+BAOLTC) that significantly outperforms BAOLTC with a normalized AUC improvement of 16.5%. Our feature importance analysis with SHAP reveals that developer expertise in the studied project is the most influential feature dimension for predicting LTCs. Finally, we develop a cost-effective model (KULTC_DEV_EXP+BAOLTC) that significantly outperforms BAOLTC. These encouraging results can be helpful to researchers who wish to further study the developers' engagement/retention to FLOSS projects or build models for predicting LTCs.</p></details> |  |

| **[Leveraging 2D Information for Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Vanilla Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13810v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series prediction is crucial for understanding and forecasting complex dynamics in various domains, ranging from finance and economics to climate and healthcare. Based on Transformer architecture, one approach involves encoding multiple variables from the same timestamp into a single temporal token to model global dependencies. In contrast, another approach embeds the time points of individual series into separate variate tokens. The former method faces challenges in learning variate-centric representations, while the latter risks missing essential temporal information critical for accurate forecasting. In our work, we introduce GridTST, a model that combines the benefits of two approaches using innovative multi-directional attentions based on a vanilla Transformer. We regard the input time series data as a grid, where the $x$-axis represents the time steps and the $y$-axis represents the variates. A vertical slicing of this grid combines the variates at each time step into a \textit{time token}, while a horizontal slicing embeds the individual series across all time steps into a \textit{variate token}. Correspondingly, a \textit{horizontal attention mechanism} focuses on time tokens to comprehend the correlations between data at various time steps, while a \textit{vertical}, variate-aware \textit{attention} is employed to grasp multivariate correlations. This combination enables efficient processing of information across both time and variate dimensions, thereby enhancing the model's analytical strength. % We also integrate the patch technique, segmenting time tokens into subseries-level patches, ensuring that local semantic information is retained in the embedding. The GridTST model consistently delivers state-of-the-art performance across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the stability of second order gradient descent for time varying convex functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13765v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient based optimization algorithms deployed in Machine Learning (ML) applications are often analyzed and compared by their convergence rates or regret bounds. While these rates and bounds convey valuable information they don't always directly translate to stability guarantees. Stability and similar concepts, like robustness, will become ever more important as we move towards deploying models in real-time and safety critical systems. In this work we build upon the results in Gaudio et al. 2021 and Moreu and Annaswamy 2022 for second order gradient descent when applied to explicitly time varying cost functions and provide more general stability guarantees. These more general results can aid in the design and certification of these optimization schemes so as to help ensure safe and reliable deployment for real-time learning applications. We also hope that the techniques provided here will stimulate and cross-fertilize the analysis that occurs on the same algorithms from the online learning and stochastic optimization communities.</p></details> | 13 pages, 0 figures |

Given a graph $G$ with a set $\pi(v)$ of feasible degrees, called a degree constraint, for each vertex $v$ of $G$, the general factor problem is to find a (spanning) subgraph $F$ of $G$ such that $\text{deg}_F(x) \in \pi(v)$ for every $v$ of $G$. When all degree constraints are symmetric $\Delta$-matroids, the problem is solvable in polynomial time. The weighted general factor problem is to find a general factor of the maximum total weight in an edge-weighted graph. In this paper, we present the first strongly polynomial-time algorithm for a type of weighted general factor problems with real-valued edge weights that is provably not reducible to the weighted matching problem by gadget constructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a full version of an ISAAC 2023 paper</p></details> |

To achieve this, we perform in-context learning in latent space utilizing a novel integration of the Prior-data Fitted Networks (PFN) and Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) frameworks. We leverage the JEPA framework to create a prediction-optimized latent representation of the underlying stochastic process that generates time series and combines it with contextual learning, using a PFN. Furthermore, we improve on preceding works by utilizing related time series as a context and introducing a normalized abstract time axis. This reduces training time and increases the versatility of the model by allowing any time granularity and forecast horizon. We show that this results in superior zero-shot predictions compared to established baselines. We also demonstrate our latent space produces informative embeddings of both individual time steps and fixed-length summaries of entire series. Finally, we observe the emergence of multi-step patch embeddings without explicit training, suggesting the model actively learns discrete tokens that encode local structures in the data, analogous to vision transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages plus references and appendix, 2 tables, 11 figures, added seeds, corrections</p></details> |

Drones offer a faster and more flexible solution, but optimizing their search paths is crucial. This paper explores the use of deep reinforcement learning to create efficient search missions for drones in wilderness environments. Our approach leverages a priori data about the search area and the missing person in the form of a probability distribution map. This allows the deep reinforcement learning agent to learn optimal flight paths that maximize the probability of finding the missing person quickly. Experimental results show that our method achieves a significant improvement in search times compared to traditional coverage planning and search planning algorithms. In one comparison, deep reinforcement learning is found to outperform other algorithms by over $160\%$, a difference that can mean life or death in real-world search operations. Additionally, unlike previous work, our approach incorporates a continuous action space enabled by cubature, allowing for more nuanced flight patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 19 figures.

They allow one to reduce equivalence or preorder checking to model checking, and are exactly the formulae in the modal logics characterizing classic behavioural equivalences and preorders for which model checking can be reduced to equivalence or preorder checking. This paper studies the complexity of determining whether a formula is characteristic for some finite, loop-free process in each of the logics providing modal characterizations of the simulation-based semantics in van Glabbeek's branching-time spectrum. Since characteristic formulae in each of those logics are exactly the consistent and prime ones, it presents complexity results for the satisfiability and primality problems, and investigates the boundary between modal logics for which those problems can be solved in polynomial time and those for which they become computationally hard. Amongst other contributions, this article also studies the complexity of constructing characteristic formulae in the modal logics characterizing simulation-based semantics, both when such formulae are presented in explicit form and via systems of equations.</p></details> | 64 pages, 1 figure |

Notably, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has marked a significant milestone by adopting a discrete scene representation, facilitating efficient training and real-time rendering. Several studies have successfully extended the real-time rendering capability of 3DGS to dynamic scenes. However, a challenge arises when training images are captured under vastly differing weather and lighting conditions. This scenario poses a challenge for 3DGS and its variants in achieving accurate reconstructions. Although NeRF-based methods (NeRF-W, CLNeRF) have shown promise in handling such challenging conditions, their computational demands hinder real-time rendering capabilities. In this paper, we present Gaussian Time Machine (GTM) which models the time-dependent attributes of Gaussian primitives with discrete time embedding vectors decoded by a lightweight Multi-Layer-Perceptron(MLP). By adjusting the opacity of Gaussian primitives, we can reconstruct visibility changes of objects. We further propose a decomposed color model for improved geometric consistency. GTM achieved state-of-the-art rendering fidelity on 3 datasets and is 100 times faster than NeRF-based counterparts in rendering. Moreover, GTM successfully disentangles the appearance changes and renders smooth appearance interpolation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

We introduce the ConcertoRL algorithm to enhance control precision and stabilize the online training process, which consists of two main innovations: a time-interleaved mechanism to interweave classical controllers with reinforcement learning-based controllers aiming to improve control precision in the initial stages, a policy composer organizes the experience gained from previous learning to ensure the stability of the online training process. This paper conducts a series of experiments. First, experiments incorporating the time-interleaved mechanism demonstrate a substantial performance boost of approximately 70% over scenarios without reinforcement learning enhancements and a 50% increase in efficiency compared to reference controllers with doubled control frequencies. These results highlight the algorithm's ability to create a synergistic effect that exceeds the sum of its parts.</p></details> | 48 pages, 35 figures |

They are among the interesting subgraphs in network analysis to get insights on both the local and global structure of a network. While several algorithms exist for discovering and enumerating graphlets, the cost per solution of such algorithms typically depends on the size of the graph $G$, or its maximum degree. In real networks, even the latter can be in the order of millions, whereas $k$ is typically required to be a small value. In this paper we provide the first algorithm to list all graphlets of order $k$ in a graph $G=(V,E)$ with an amortized cost per solution depending \emph{solely} on the order $k$, contrarily to previous approaches where the cost depends \emph{also} on the size of $G$ or its maximum degree. Specifically, we show that it is possible to list $k$-graphlets in $O(k^2)$ time per solution, and to list edge $k$-graphlets in $O(k)$ time per solution. Furthermore we show that, if the input graph has bounded degree, then the cost per solution for listing $k$-graphlets is reduced to $O(k)$. Whenever $k = O(1)$, as it is often the case in practical settings, these algorithms are the first to achieve constant time per solution.</p></details> |  |

| **[ETTrack: Enhanced Temporal Motion Predictor for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15755v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) approaches exploit motion information to associate all the detected objects across frames. However, many methods that rely on filtering-based algorithms, such as the Kalman Filter, often work well in linear motion scenarios but struggle to accurately predict the locations of objects undergoing complex and non-linear movements. To tackle these scenarios, we propose a motion-based MOT approach with an enhanced temporal motion predictor, ETTrack. Specifically, the motion predictor integrates a transformer model and a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) to capture short-term and long-term motion patterns, and it predicts the future motion of individual objects based on the historical motion information. Additionally, we propose a novel Momentum Correction Loss function that provides additional information regarding the motion direction of objects during training. This allows the motion predictor rapidly adapt to motion variations and more accurately predict future motion. Our experimental results demonstrate that ETTrack achieves a competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art trackers on DanceTrack and SportsMOT, scoring 56.4% and 74.4% in HOTA metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 16 pages, 7 figures |

One critical aspect is formulating a consistency constraint specifically for temporal-spatial illumination and appearance enhanced versions, a dimension overlooked in existing methods. In this paper, we present an innovative video Retinex-based decomposition strategy that operates without the need for explicit supervision to delineate illumination and reflectance components. We leverage dynamic cross-frame correspondences for intrinsic appearance and enforce a scene-level continuity constraint on the illumination field to yield satisfactory consistent decomposition results. To further ensure consistent decomposition, we introduce a dual-structure enhancement network featuring a novel cross-frame interaction mechanism. This mechanism can seamlessly integrate with encoder-decoder single-frame networks, incurring minimal additional parameter costs. By supervising different frames simultaneously, this network encourages them to exhibit matching decomposition features, thus achieving the desired temporal propagation. Extensive experiments are conducted on widely recognized LLVE benchmarks, covering diverse scenarios. Our framework consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoilNet: An Attention-based Spatio-temporal Deep Learning Framework for Soil Organic Carbon Prediction with Digital Soil Mapping in Europe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03586v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital soil mapping (DSM) is an advanced approach that integrates statistical modeling and cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning (ML) methods, to accurately depict soil properties and their spatial distribution. Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a crucial soil attribute providing valuable insights into soil health, nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, and overall ecosystem productivity. This study highlights the significance of spatial-temporal deep learning (DL) techniques within the DSM framework. A novel architecture is proposed, incorporating spatial information using a base convolutional neural network (CNN) model and spatial attention mechanism, along with climate temporal information using a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, for SOC prediction across Europe. The model utilizes a comprehensive set of environmental features, including Landsat-8 images, topography, remote sensing indices, and climate time series, as input features. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms conventional ML approaches like random forest commonly used in DSM, yielding lower root mean square error (RMSE). This model is a robust tool for predicting SOC and could be applied to other soil properties, thereby contributing to the advancement of DSM techniques and facilitating land management and decision-making processes based on accurate information.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[CPT-Interp: Continuous sPatial and Temporal Motion Modeling for 4D Medical Image Interpolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15385v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion information from 4D medical imaging offers critical insights into dynamic changes in patient anatomy for clinical assessments and radiotherapy planning and, thereby, enhances the capabilities of 3D image analysis. However, inherent physical and technical constraints of imaging hardware often necessitate a compromise between temporal resolution and image quality. Frame interpolation emerges as a pivotal solution to this challenge. Previous methods often suffer from discretion when they estimate the intermediate motion and execute the forward warping. In this study, we draw inspiration from fluid mechanics to propose a novel approach for continuously modeling patient anatomic motion using implicit neural representation. It ensures both spatial and temporal continuity, effectively bridging Eulerian and Lagrangian specifications together to naturally facilitate continuous frame interpolation. Our experiments across multiple datasets underscore the method's superior accuracy and speed. Furthermore, as a case-specific optimization (training-free) approach, it circumvents the need for extensive datasets and addresses model generalization issues.</p></details> |  |

While often spatial data is represented in a tabular format, a graph based representation provides the possibility to interconnect entities which would have been separated in a tabular representation. We propose in our paper a framework which supports a planet scale transformation of OpenStreetMap data into a Spatial Temporal Knowledge Graph. In addition to OpenStreetMap data, we align the different OpenStreetMap geometries on individual h3 grid cells. We compare our constructed spatial knowledge graph to other spatial knowledge graphs and outline our contribution in this paper. As a basis for our computation, we use Apache Sedona as a computational framework for our Spatial Temporal Knowledge Graph construction</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, GeoLD2024: 6th Geospatial Linked Data Workshop, May 26, 2024, Hersonissos, Greece</p></details> |
| **[Nonparametric quantile regression for spatio-temporal processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13783v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a new and effective approach to nonparametric quantile regression that accommodates ultrahigh-dimensional data arising from spatio-temporal processes. This approach proves advantageous in staving off computational challenges that constitute known hindrances to existing nonparametric quantile regression methods when the number of predictors is much larger than the available sample size. We investigate conditions under which estimation is feasible and of good overall quality and obtain sharp approximations that we employ to devising statistical inference methodology. These include simultaneous confidence intervals and tests of hypotheses, whose asymptotics is borne by a non-trivial functional central limit theorem tailored to martingale differences. Additionally, we provide finite-sample results through various simulations which, accompanied by an illustrative application to real-worldesque data (on electricity demand), offer guarantees on the performance of the proposed methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 2 figures and accompanying supplementary documentation</p></details> |
| **[On the Identification of Temporally Causal Representation with Instantaneous Dependence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15325v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporally causal representation learning aims to identify the latent causal process from time series observations, but most methods require the assumption that the latent causal processes do not have instantaneous relations. Although some recent methods achieve identifiability in the instantaneous causality case, they require either interventions on the latent variables or grouping of the observations, which are in general difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. To fill this gap, we propose an \textbf{ID}entification framework for instantane\textbf{O}us \textbf{L}atent dynamics (\textbf{IDOL}) by imposing a sparse influence constraint that the latent causal processes have sparse time-delayed and instantaneous relations. Specifically, we establish identifiability results of the latent causal process based on sufficient variability and the sparse influence constraint by employing contextual information of time series data. Based on these theories, we incorporate a temporally variational inference architecture to estimate the latent variables and a gradient-based sparsity regularization to identify the latent causal process. Experimental results on simulation datasets illustrate that our method can identify the latent causal process. Furthermore, evaluations on multiple human motion forecasting benchmarks with instantaneous dependencies indicate the effectiveness of our method in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[TACO: Temporal Latent Action-Driven Contrastive Loss for Visual Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13229v3)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in reinforcement learning (RL) from raw pixel data, sample inefficiency continues to present a substantial obstacle. Prior works have attempted to address this challenge by creating self-supervised auxiliary tasks, aiming to enrich the agent's learned representations with control-relevant information for future state prediction. However, these objectives are often insufficient to learn representations that can represent the optimal policy or value function, and they often consider tasks with small, abstract discrete action spaces and thus overlook the importance of action representation learning in continuous control. In this paper, we introduce TACO: Temporal Action-driven Contrastive Learning, a simple yet powerful temporal contrastive learning approach that facilitates the concurrent acquisition of latent state and action representations for agents. TACO simultaneously learns a state and an action representation by optimizing the mutual information between representations of current states paired with action sequences and representations of the corresponding future states. Theoretically, TACO can be shown to learn state and action representations that encompass sufficient information for control, thereby improving sample efficiency. For online RL, TACO achieves 40% performance boost after one million environment interaction steps on average across nine challenging visual continuous control tasks from Deepmind Control Suite. In addition, we show that TACO can also serve as a plug-and-play module adding to existing offline visual RL methods to establish the new state-of-the-art performance for offline visual RL across offline datasets with varying quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023)</p></details> |
| **[Facilitating Battery Swapping Services for Freight Trucks with Spatial-Temporal Demand Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04440v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electrifying heavy-duty trucks offers a substantial opportunity to curtail carbon emissions, advancing toward a carbon-neutral future. However, the inherent challenges of limited battery energy and the sheer weight of heavy-duty trucks lead to reduced mileage and prolonged charging durations. Consequently, battery-swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[STC-ViT: Spatio Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for Weather Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17966v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Operational weather forecasting system relies on computationally expensive physics-based models. Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Stamp Classifier: Classifying Short Sequences of Astronomical Alerts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15073v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a deep learning-based classification model of astronomical objects using alerts reported by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. The model takes as inputs sequences of stamp images and metadata contained in each alert, as well as features from the All-WISE catalog. The proposed model, called temporal stamp classifier, is able to discriminate between three classes of astronomical objects: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), Super-Novae (SNe) and Variable Stars (VS), with an accuracy of approximately 98% in the test set, when using 2 to 5 detections. The results show that the model performance improves with the addition of more detections. Simple recurrence models obtain competitive results with those of more complex models such as LSTM.We also propose changes to the original stamp classifier model, which only uses the first detection. The performance of the latter model improves with changes in the architecture and the addition of random rotations, achieving a 1.46% increase in test accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in International Joint Conference on Neural Networks 2024</p></details> |
| **[Premier-TACO is a Few-Shot Policy Learner: Pretraining Multitask Representation via Temporal Action-Driven Contrastive Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06187v4)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Premier-TACO, a multitask feature representation learning approach designed to improve few-shot policy learning efficiency in sequential decision-making tasks. Premier-TACO leverages a subset of multitask offline datasets for pretraining a general feature representation, which captures critical environmental dynamics and is fine-tuned using minimal expert demonstrations. It advances the temporal action contrastive learning (TACO) objective, known for state-of-the-art results in visual control tasks, by incorporating a novel negative example sampling strategy. This strategy is crucial in significantly boosting TACO's computational efficiency, making large-scale multitask offline pretraining feasible. Our extensive empirical evaluation in a diverse set of continuous control benchmarks including Deepmind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and LIBERO demonstrate Premier-TACO's effectiveness in pretraining visual representations, significantly enhancing few-shot imitation learning of novel tasks.

| **[Decomposition-based Hierarchical Task Allocation and Planning for Multi-Robots under Hierarchical Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10393v3)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Past research into robotic planning with temporal logic specifications, notably Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), was largely based on a single formula for individual or groups of robots. But with increasing task complexity, LTL formulas unavoidably grow lengthy, complicating interpretation and specification generation, and straining the computational capacities of the planners. A recent development has been the hierarchical representation of LTL~\cite{luo2024simultaneous} that contains multiple temporal logic specifications, providing a more interpretable framework. However, the proposed planning algorithm assumes the independence of robots within each specification, limiting their application to multi-robot coordination with complex temporal constraints. In this work, we formulated a decomposition-based hierarchical framework. At the high level, each specification is first decomposed into a set of atomic sub-tasks. We further infer the temporal relations among the sub-tasks of different specifications to construct a task network. Subsequently, a Mixed Integer Linear Program is used to assign sub-tasks to various robots. At the lower level, domain-specific controllers are employed to execute sub-tasks. Our approach was experimentally applied to domains of navigation and manipulation. The simulation demonstrated that our approach can find better solutions using less runtimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures.

| **[PhiNets: Brain-inspired Non-contrastive Learning Based on Temporal Prediction Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14650v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SimSiam is a prominent self-supervised learning method that achieves impressive results in various vision tasks under static environments. However, it has two critical issues: high sensitivity to hyperparameters, especially weight decay, and unsatisfactory performance in online and continual learning, where neuroscientists believe that powerful memory functions are necessary, as in brains. In this paper, we propose PhiNet, inspired by a hippocampal model based on the temporal prediction hypothesis. Unlike SimSiam, which aligns two augmented views of the original image, PhiNet integrates an additional predictor block that estimates the original image representation to imitate the CA1 region in the hippocampus. Moreover, we model the neocortex inspired by the Complementary Learning Systems theory with a momentum encoder block as a slow learner, which works as long-term memory. We demonstrate through analysing the learning dynamics that PhiNet benefits from the additional predictor to prevent the complete collapse of learned representations, a notorious challenge in non-contrastive learning. This dynamics analysis may partially corroborate why this hippocampal model is biologically plausible. Experimental results demonstrate that PhiNet is more robust to weight decay and performs better than SimSiam in memory-intensive tasks like online and continual learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Video is Worth 256 Bases: Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization Inversion for Zero-Shot Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05856v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a video inversion approach for zero-shot video editing, which models the input video with low-rank representation during the inversion process. The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

| **[UniST: A Prompt-Empowered Universal Model for Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11838v3)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for informed decision-making, such as transportation management, resource optimization, and urban planning. Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios. The implementation is available at this repository: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time Cell Inspired Temporal Codebook in Spiking Neural Networks for Enhanced Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14474v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel approach leveraging Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to construct a Variational Quantized Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) with a temporal codebook inspired by hippocampal time cells. This design captures and utilizes temporal dependencies, significantly enhancing the generative capabilities of SNNs. Neuroscientific research has identified hippocampal "time cells" that fire sequentially during temporally structured experiences. Our temporal codebook emulates this behavior by triggering the activation of time cell populations based on similarity measures as input stimuli pass through it. We conducted extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, CelebA, and downsampled LSUN Bedroom, to validate our model's performance. Furthermore, we evaluated the effectiveness of the temporal codebook on neuromorphic datasets NMNIST and DVS-CIFAR10, and demonstrated the model's capability with high-resolution datasets such as CelebA-HQ, LSUN Bedroom, and LSUN Church. The experimental results indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing SNN-based generative models across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, our approach excels in generating high-resolution and temporally consistent data, underscoring the crucial role of temporal information in SNN-based generative modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikeMba: Multi-Modal Spiking Saliency Mamba for Temporal Video Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01174v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal video grounding (TVG) is a critical task in video content understanding, requiring precise alignment between video content and natural language instructions. Despite significant advancements, existing methods face challenges in managing confidence bias towards salient objects and capturing long-term dependencies in video sequences. To address these issues, we introduce SpikeMba: a multi-modal spiking saliency mamba for temporal video grounding. Our approach integrates Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with state space models (SSMs) to leverage their unique advantages in handling different aspects of the task. Specifically, we use SNNs to develop a spiking saliency detector that generates the proposal set. The detector emits spike signals when the input signal exceeds a predefined threshold, resulting in a dynamic and binary saliency proposal set. To enhance the model's capability to retain and infer contextual information, we introduce relevant slots which learnable tensors that encode prior knowledge. These slots work with the contextual moment reasoner to maintain a balance between preserving contextual information and exploring semantic relevance dynamically. The SSMs facilitate selective information propagation, addressing the challenge of long-term dependency in video content. By combining SNNs for proposal generation and SSMs for effective contextual reasoning, SpikeMba addresses confidence bias and long-term dependencies, thereby significantly enhancing fine-grained multimodal relationship capture. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SpikeMba, which consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across mainstream benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

For this class of stochastic partial differential equations the weak convergence rates we obtain are indeed twice the known strong rates. To the best of our knowledge, our findings are the first in the scientific literature which provide essentially sharp weak convergence rates for temporal discretisations of stochastic wave equations with multiplicative noise. Key ideas of our proof are a sophisticated splitting of the error and applications of the recently introduced mild It\^{o} formula. We complement our analytical findings by means of numerical simulations in Python for the decay of the weak approximation error for SPDEs for four different test functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 1 figure; numerical simulations added, typos corrected, references added</p></details> |
| **[stl2vec: Semantic and Interpretable Vector Representation of Temporal Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14389v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating symbolic knowledge and data-driven learning algorithms is a longstanding challenge in Artificial Intelligence. Despite the recognized importance of this task, a notable gap exists due to the discreteness of symbolic representations and the continuous nature of machine-learning computations. One of the desired bridges between these two worlds would be to define semantically grounded vector representation (feature embedding) of logic formulae, thus enabling to perform continuous learning and optimization in the semantic space of formulae. We tackle this goal for knowledge expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and devise a method to compute continuous embeddings of formulae with several desirable properties: the embedding (i) is finite-dimensional, (ii) faithfully reflects the semantics of the formulae, (iii) does not require any learning but instead is defined from basic principles, (iv) is interpretable. Another significant contribution lies in demonstrating the efficacy of the approach in two tasks: learning model checking, where we predict the probability of requirements being satisfied in stochastic processes; and integrating the embeddings into a neuro-symbolic framework, to constrain the output of a deep-learning generative model to comply to a given logical specification.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-End Streaming Video Temporal Action Segmentation with Reinforce Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15683v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The streaming temporal action segmentation (STAS) task, a supplementary task of temporal action segmentation (TAS), has not received adequate attention in the field of video understanding. Existing TAS methods are constrained to offline scenarios due to their heavy reliance on multimodal features and complete contextual information. The STAS task requires the model to classify each frame of the entire untrimmed video sequence clip by clip in time, thereby extending the applicability of TAS methods to online scenarios. However, directly applying existing TAS methods to SATS tasks results in significantly poor segmentation outcomes. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze the fundamental differences between STAS tasks and TAS tasks, attributing the severe performance degradation when transferring models to model bias and optimization dilemmas. We introduce an end-to-end streaming video temporal action segmentation model with reinforcement learning (SVTAS-RL). The end-to-end modeling method mitigates the modeling bias introduced by the change in task nature and enhances the feasibility of online solutions. Reinforcement learning is utilized to alleviate the optimization dilemma. Through extensive experiments, the SVTAS-RL model significantly outperforms existing STAS models and achieves competitive performance to the state-of-the-art TAS model on multiple datasets under the same evaluation criteria, demonstrating notable advantages on the ultra-long video dataset EGTEA.

| **[Retrieval-Augmented Mining of Temporal Logic Specifications from Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14355v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of cyber-physical systems (CPS) into everyday life raises the critical necessity of ensuring their safety and reliability. An important step in this direction is requirement mining, i.e. inferring formally specified system properties from observed behaviors, in order to discover knowledge about the system. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) offers a concise yet expressive language for specifying requirements, particularly suited for CPS, where behaviors are typically represented as time series data. This work addresses the task of learning STL requirements from observed behaviors in a data-driven manner, focusing on binary classification, i.e. on inferring properties of the system which are able to discriminate between regular and anomalous behaviour, and that can be used both as classifiers and as monitors of the compliance of the CPS to desirable specifications. We present a novel framework that combines Bayesian Optimization (BO) and Information Retrieval (IR) techniques to simultaneously learn both the structure and the parameters of STL formulae, without restrictions on the STL grammar. Specifically, we propose a framework that leverages a dense vector database containing semantic-preserving continuous representations of millions of formulae, queried for facilitating the mining of requirements inside a BO loop. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in several signal classification applications, showing its ability to extract interpretable insights from system executions and advance the state-of-the-art in requirement mining for CPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAMBA4D: Efficient Long-Sequence Point Cloud Video Understanding with Disentangled Spatial-Temporal State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14338v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud videos effectively capture real-world spatial geometries and temporal dynamics, which are essential for enabling intelligent agents to understand the dynamically changing 3D world we live in. Although static 3D point cloud processing has witnessed significant advancements, designing an effective 4D point cloud video backbone remains challenging, mainly due to the irregular and unordered distribution of points and temporal inconsistencies across frames. Moreover, recent state-of-the-art 4D backbones predominantly rely on transformer-based architectures, which commonly suffer from large computational costs due to their quadratic complexity, particularly when processing long video sequences. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 4D point cloud video understanding backbone based on the recently advanced State Space Models (SSMs). Specifically, our backbone begins by disentangling space and time in raw 4D sequences, and then establishing spatio-temporal correlations using our newly developed Intra-frame Spatial Mamba and Inter-frame Temporal Mamba blocks. The Intra-frame Spatial Mamba module is designed to encode locally similar or related geometric structures within a certain temporal searching stride, which can effectively capture short-term dynamics. Subsequently, these locally correlated tokens are delivered to the Inter-frame Temporal Mamba module, which globally integrates point features across the entire video with linear complexity, further establishing long-range motion dependencies. Experimental results on human action recognition and 4D semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method. Especially, for long video sequences, our proposed Mamba-based method has an 87.5% GPU memory reduction, 5.36 times speed-up, and much higher accuracy (up to +10.4%) compared with transformer-based counterparts on MSR-Action3D dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChronosLex: Time-aware Incremental Training for Temporal Generalization of Legal Classification Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14211v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the challenges posed by the dynamic nature of legal multi-label text classification tasks, where legal concepts evolve over time. Existing models often overlook the temporal dimension in their training process, leading to suboptimal performance of those models over time, as they treat training data as a single homogeneous block. To address this, we introduce ChronosLex, an incremental training paradigm that trains models on chronological splits, preserving the temporal order of the data. However, this incremental approach raises concerns about overfitting to recent data, prompting an assessment of mitigation strategies using continual learning and temporal invariant methods. Our experimental results over six legal multi-label text classification datasets reveal that continual learning methods prove effective in preventing overfitting thereby enhancing temporal generalizability, while temporal invariant methods struggle to capture these dynamics of temporal shifts.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |
| **[Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14170v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) is the process of utilizing temporal information to capture complex relations within a Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) to infer new knowledge. Conventional methods in TKGR typically depend on deep learning algorithms or temporal logical rules. However, deep learning-based TKGRs often lack interpretability, whereas rule-based TKGRs struggle to effectively learn temporal rules that capture temporal patterns. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated extensive knowledge and remarkable proficiency in temporal reasoning. Consequently, the employment of LLMs for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning (TKGR) has sparked increasing interest among researchers. Nonetheless, LLMs are known to function as black boxes, making it challenging to comprehend their reasoning process. Additionally, due to the resource-intensive nature of fine-tuning, promptly updating LLMs to integrate evolving knowledge within TKGs for reasoning is impractical. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a Large Language Models-guided Dynamic Adaptation (LLM-DA) method for reasoning on TKGs. Specifically, LLM-DA harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to analyze historical data and extract temporal logical rules. These rules unveil temporal patterns and facilitate interpretable reasoning. To account for the evolving nature of TKGs, a dynamic adaptation strategy is proposed to update the LLM-generated rules with the latest events. This ensures that the extracted rules always incorporate the most recent knowledge and better generalize to the predictions on future events. Experimental results show that without the need of fine-tuning, LLM-DA significantly improves the accuracy of reasoning over several common datasets, providing a robust framework for TKGR tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Algorithm for Node Feature Forecasting in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16800v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose an online algorithm mspace for forecasting node features in temporal graphs, which captures spatial cross-correlation among different nodes as well as the temporal auto-correlation within a node. The algorithm can be used for both probabilistic and deterministic multi-step forecasting, making it applicable for estimation and generation tasks. Comparative evaluations against various baselines, including temporal graph neural network (TGNN) models and classical Kalman filters, demonstrate that mspace performs at par with the state-of-the-art and even surpasses them on some datasets. Importantly, mspace demonstrates consistent performance across datasets with varying training sizes, a notable advantage over TGNN models that require abundant training samples to effectively learn the spatiotemporal trends in the data. Therefore, employing mspace is advantageous in scenarios where the training sample availability is limited. Additionally, we establish theoretical bounds on multi-step forecasting error of mspace and show that it scales linearly with the number of forecast steps $q$ as $\mathcal{O}(q)$. For an asymptotically large number of nodes $n$, and timesteps $T$, the computational complexity of mspace grows linearly with both $n$, and $T$, i.e., $\mathcal{O}(nT)$, while its space complexity remains constant $\mathcal{O}(1)$. We compare the performance of various mspace variants against ten recent TGNN baselines and two classical baselines, ARIMA and the Kalman filter across ten real-world datasets. Additionally, we propose a technique to generate synthetic datasets to aid in evaluating node feature forecasting methods, with the potential to serve as a benchmark for future research. Lastly, we have investigate the interpretability of different mspace variants by analyzing model parameters alongside dataset characteristics to derive model and data-centric insights.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Literature in the field of behavioural psychology indicates that gait, described as the way a person walks, is an additional indicator of emotions. In this work, we propose a deep framework for emotion recognition through the analysis of gait. More specifically, our model is composed of a sequence of spatial-temporal Graph Convolutional Networks that produce a robust skeleton-based representation for the task of emotion classification. We evaluate our proposed framework on the E-Gait dataset, composed of a total of 2177 samples. The results obtained represent an improvement of approximately 5% in accuracy compared to the state of the art. In addition, during training we observed a faster convergence of our model compared to the state-of-the-art methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the LXCV Workshop @ CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Transformers Learn Temporal Difference Methods for In-Context Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13861v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning refers to the learning ability of a model during inference time without adapting its parameters. The input (i.e., prompt) to the model (e.g., transformers) consists of both a context (i.e., instance-label pairs) and a query instance. The model is then able to output a label for the query instance according to the context during inference. A possible explanation for in-context learning is that the forward pass of (linear) transformers implements iterations of gradient descent on the instance-label pairs in the context. In this paper, we prove by construction that transformers can also implement temporal difference (TD) learning in the forward pass, a phenomenon we refer to as in-context TD. We demonstrate the emergence of in-context TD after training the transformer with a multi-task TD algorithm, accompanied by theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we prove that transformers are expressive enough to implement many other policy evaluation algorithms in the forward pass, including residual gradient, TD with eligibility trace, and average-reward TD.</p></details> |  |

We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Generalizing Weather Forecast to Fine-grained Temporal Scales via Physics-AI Hybrid Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13796v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) models have made significant advancements in weather forecasting, particularly in medium-range and nowcasting. However, most data-driven weather forecasting models are black-box systems that focus on learning data mapping rather than fine-grained physical evolution in the time dimension. Consequently, the limitations in the temporal scale of datasets prevent these models from forecasting at finer time scales. This paper proposes a physics-AI hybrid model (i.e., WeatherGFT) which Generalizes weather forecasts to Finer-grained Temporal scales beyond training dataset. Specifically, we employ a carefully designed PDE kernel to simulate physical evolution on a small time scale (e.g., 300 seconds) and use a parallel neural networks with a learnable router for bias correction. Furthermore, we introduce a lead time-aware training framework to promote the generalization of the model at different lead times. The weight analysis of physics-AI modules indicates that physics conducts major evolution while AI performs corrections adaptively. Extensive experiments show that WeatherGFT trained on an hourly dataset, achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple lead times and exhibits the capability to generalize 30-minute forecasts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Scenario Logic: A Spatial-Temporal Logic for Modeling and Reasoning of Urban Traffic Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13715v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal representations of traffic scenarios can be used to generate test cases for the safety verification of autonomous driving. However, most existing methods are limited in highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving.</p></details> | Submitted to KR 2024 |
| **[VTG-LLM: Integrating Timestamp Knowledge into Video LLMs for Enhanced Video Temporal Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13382v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) focuses on accurately identifying event timestamps within a particular video based on a linguistic query, playing a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. While Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) have made significant progress in understanding video content, they often face challenges in accurately pinpointing timestamps within videos, which limits their performance on VTG tasks. Therefore, to improve video LLMs' ability to effectively locate timestamps, we argue that two critical aspects need to be enhanced. First, it is essential to have high-quality instructional tuning datasets that encompass mainstream VTG tasks. Second, directly incorporating timestamp knowledge into video LLMs is crucial, as it enables models to efficiently comprehend timestamp information. To address these needs, we first introduce VTG-IT-120K, a high-quality and comprehensive instruction tuning dataset that covers VTG tasks such as moment retrieval, dense video captioning, video summarization, and video highlight detection. Furthermore, we propose a specially designed video LLM model for VTG tasks, VTG-LLM, which (1) effectively integrates timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporates absolute-time tokens that specifically handle timestamp knowledge, thereby avoiding concept shifts; and (3) introduces a lightweight, high-performance slot-based token compression method to facilitate the sampling of more video frames. Comprehensive experiments showcase the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across various VTG tasks.

| **[System Safety Monitoring of Learned Components Using Temporal Metric Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13254v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In learning-enabled autonomous systems, safety monitoring of learned components is crucial to ensure their outputs do not lead to system safety violations, given the operational context of the system. However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using an autonomous aviation case study. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for the autonomous aviation case study, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Spatio-Temporal Embedding for Brain Structural-Effective Network with Ordinary Differential Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13190v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The MRI-derived brain network serves as a pivotal instrument in elucidating both the structural and functional aspects of the brain, encompassing the ramifications of diseases and developmental processes. However, prevailing methodologies, often focusing on synchronous BOLD signals from functional MRI (fMRI), may not capture directional influences among brain regions and rarely tackle temporal functional dynamics. In this study, we first construct the brain-effective network via the dynamic causal model. Subsequently, we introduce an interpretable graph learning framework termed Spatio-Temporal Embedding ODE (STE-ODE). This framework incorporates specifically designed directed node embedding layers, aiming at capturing the dynamic interplay between structural and effective networks via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which characterizes spatial-temporal brain dynamics. Our framework is validated on several clinical phenotype prediction tasks using two independent publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks to Simulate Physical Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12868v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to represent and simulate the dynamics of physical systems is a crucial yet challenging task. Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published to the conference of NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

Classical control theoretical tools addressing STL constraints either adopt a limited fragment of the STL formula or require approximations of min/max operators, whereas works maximising robustness through optimisation-based methods often suffer from local minima, relaxing any completeness arguments due to the NP-hard nature of the problem. Endowed with probabilistic guarantees, MAPS$^2$ provides an anytime algorithm that iteratively improves the robots' trajectories. The algorithm selectively imposes spatial constraints by taking advantage of the temporal properties of the STL. The algorithm is distributed, in the sense that each robot calculates its trajectory by communicating only with its immediate neighbours as defined via a communication graph. We illustrate the efficiency of MAPS$^2$ by conducting extensive simulation and experimental studies, verifying the generation of STL satisfying trajectories.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a temporal logic based approach that allows robots' behaviors and goals to adapt to the semantics of the environment. In particular, we present a hierarchical representation of soccer in which the robot selects the level of operation based on the perceived semantic characteristics of the environment, thus modifying dynamically the set of rules and goals to apply. The proposed approach enables the robot to operate in unstructured environments, just as it happens when humans go from soccer played on an official field to soccer played on a street. Three different use cases set in different scenarios are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>RoboC...</summary><p>RoboCup 2023: Robot World Cup XXVI Best Paper</p></details> |

However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p></details> |  |

The co-dynamics can be mediated by immunosuppression or -modulation, shared environmental or climatic drivers, or competition for susceptible hosts. Research and statistical methods in epidemiology often concentrate on large pooled datasets, or high quality data from cities, leaving rural areas underrepresented in literature. Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging such pretrained models for video editing is considered a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to enforce temporal consistency in the edited video through explicit correspondence mechanisms, either in pixel space or between deep features. These methods, however, struggle with strong nonrigid motion. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach, which is based on the observation that spatiotemporal slices of natural videos exhibit similar characteristics to natural images. Thus, the same T2I diffusion model that is normally used only as a prior on video frames, can also serve as a strong prior for enhancing temporal consistency by applying it on spatiotemporal slices. Based on this observation, we present Slicedit, a method for text-based video editing that utilizes a pretrained T2I diffusion model to process both spatial and spatiotemporal slices. Our method generates videos that retain the structure and motion of the original video while adhering to the target text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate Slicedit's ability to edit a wide range of real-world videos, confirming its clear advantages compared to existing competing methods.

While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

| **[A Temporal Stochastic Bias Correction using a Machine Learning Attention model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14169v4)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate models are biased with respect to real-world observations. They usually need to be adjusted before being used in impact studies. The suite of statistical methods that enable such adjustments is called bias correction (BC). However, BC methods currently struggle to adjust temporal biases. Because they mostly disregard the dependence between consecutive time points. As a result, climate statistics with long-range temporal properties, such as heatwave duration and frequency, cannot be corrected accurately. This makes it more difficult to produce reliable impact studies on such climate statistics. This paper offers a novel BC methodology to correct temporal biases. This is made possible by rethinking the philosophy behind BC. We will introduce BC as a time-indexed regression task with stochastic outputs. Rethinking BC enables us to adapt state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) attention models and thereby learn different types of biases, including temporal asynchronicities. With a case study of heatwave duration statistics in Abuja, Nigeria, and Tokyo, Japan, we show more accurate results than current climate model outputs and alternative BC methods.</p></details> | 38 pages, 31 figures |

Despite these empirical successes, a theoretical understanding of QTD has proven elusive until now. Unlike classical TD learning, which can be analysed with standard stochastic approximation tools, QTD updates do not approximate contraction mappings, are highly non-linear, and may have multiple fixed points. The core result of this paper is a proof of convergence to the fixed points of a related family of dynamic programming procedures with probability 1, putting QTD on firm theoretical footing. The proof establishes connections between QTD and non-linear differential inclusions through stochastic approximation theory and non-smooth analysis.</p></details> | Accepted to JMLR |

However, susceptibility to various physiological and environmental artifacts introduces noise in recorded EEG data, impeding accurate analysis of underlying brain activity. Denoising techniques are crucial to mitigate this challenge. Recent advancements in deep learningbased approaches exhibit substantial potential for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG data compared to traditional methods. In the realm of large-scale language models (LLMs), the Retentive Network (Retnet) infrastructure, prevalent for some models, demonstrates robust feature extraction and global modeling capabilities. Recognizing the temporal similarities between EEG signals and natural language, we introduce the Retnet from natural language processing to EEG denoising. This integration presents a novel approach to EEG denoising, opening avenues for a profound understanding of brain activities and accurate diagnosis of neurological diseases. Nonetheless, direct application of Retnet to EEG denoising is unfeasible due to the one-dimensional nature of EEG signals, while natural language processing deals with two-dimensional data. To facilitate Retnet application to EEG denoising, we propose the signal embedding method, transforming one-dimensional EEG signals into two dimensions for use as network inputs. Experimental results validate the substantial improvement in denoising effectiveness achieved by the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

It is difficult for a low-rigidity robot to handle its own body as intended compared to a rigid robot, and calibration between vision and body takes some time. In addition, the robot must constantly adapt to changes in its body, such as the change in camera position and change in joints due to aging. Therefore, we develop a method for a low-rigidity robot to autonomously learn visual servoing of its body. We also develop a mechanism that can adaptively change its visual servoing according to temporal body changes. We apply our method to a low-rigidity 6-axis arm, MyCobot, and confirm its effectiveness by conducting object grasping experiments based on visual servoing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

Typical methods use a speaker representation from a pre-trained speaker verification (SV) model or learn speaker representation during VC training to achieve zero-shot VC. However, existing speaker modeling methods overlook the variation of speaker information richness in temporal and frequency channel dimensions of speech. This insufficient speaker modeling hampers the ability of the VC model to accurately represent unseen speakers who are not in the training dataset. In this study, we present a robust zero-shot VC model with multi-level temporal-channel retrieval, referred to as MTCR-VC. Specifically, to flexibly adapt to the dynamic-variant speaker characteristic in the temporal and channel axis of the speech, we propose a novel fine-grained speaker modeling method, called temporal-channel retrieval (TCR), to find out when and where speaker information appears in speech. It retrieves variable-length speaker representation from both temporal and channel dimensions under the guidance of a pre-trained SV model. Besides, inspired by the hierarchical process of human speech production, the MTCR speaker module stacks several TCR blocks to extract speaker representations from multi-granularity levels. Furthermore, to achieve better speech disentanglement and reconstruction, we introduce a cycle-based training strategy to simulate zero-shot inference recurrently. We adopt perpetual constraints on three aspects, including content, style, and speaker, to drive this process. Experiments demonstrate that MTCR-VC is superior to the previous zero-shot VC methods in modeling speaker timbre while maintaining good speech naturalness.</p></details> | Submitted to TASLP |
| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |

There are many proposals for the design of intelligent intersections that introduce central decision-makers to intersections for enhancing the efficiency and safety of the vehicles. To guarantee the safety of such designs, we develop a safety framework for intersections based on temporal logic and reachability analysis. We start by specifying the required behavior for all the vehicles that need to pass through the intersection as linear temporal logic formula. Then, using temporal logic trees, we break down the linear temporal logic specification into a series of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analyses in an automated fashion. By successfully constructing the temporal logic tree through reachability analysis, we verify the feasibility of the intersection specification. By taking this approach, we enable a safety framework that is able to automatically provide safety guarantees on new intersection behavior specifications. To evaluate our approach, we implement the framework on a simulated T-intersection, where we show that we can check and guarantee the safety of vehicles with potentially conflicting paths.</p></details> |  |

In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time. The implementation code is available at: \url{https://github.com/LincanLi98/STG-Mamba}.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Model for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13257v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction, a critical aspect of intelligent transportation systems, has been increasingly popular in the field of artificial intelligence, driven by the availability of extensive traffic data. The current challenges of traffic flow prediction lie in integrating diverse factors while balancing the trade-off between computational complexity and the precision necessary for effective long-range and large-scale predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-Mamba) model, which is the first to leverage the power of spatial-temporal learning in traffic flow prediction without using graph modeling. The ST-Mamba model can effectively capture the long-range dependency for traffic flow data, thereby avoiding the issue of over-smoothing. The proposed ST-Mamba model incorporates an effective Spatial-Temporal Mixer (ST-Mixer) to seamlessly integrate spatial and temporal data processing into a unified framework and employs a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-SSM) block to improve computational efficiency. The proposed ST-Mamba model, specifically designed for spatial-temporal data, simplifies processing procedure and enhances generalization capabilities, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of long-range traffic flow prediction. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the proposed ST-Mamba model achieves a 61.11\% improvement in computational speed and increases prediction accuracy by 0.67\%. Extensive experiments with real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the \textsf{ST-Mamba} model sets a new benchmark in traffic flow prediction, achieving SOTA performance in computational efficiency for both long- and short-range predictions and significantly improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal and spatial downscaling for solar radiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11046v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global and regional climate model projections are useful for gauging future patterns of climate variables, including solar radiation, but data from these models is often too coarse to assess local impacts. Within the context of solar radiation, the changing climate may have an effect on photovoltaic (PV) production, especially as the PV industry moves to extend plant lifetimes to 50 years. Predicting PV production while taking into account a changing climate requires data at a resolution that is useful for building PV plants. Although temporal and spatial downscaling of solar radiation data is widely studied, we present a novel method to downscale solar radiation data from daily averages to hourly profiles, while maintaining spatial correlation of parameters characterizing the diurnal profile of solar radiation. The method focuses on the use of a diurnal template which can be shifted and scaled according to the time or year and location and the use of thin plate splines for spatial downscaling. This analysis is applied to data from the National Solar Radiation Database housed at the National Renewable Energy Lab and a case study of the mentioned methods over several sub-regions of continental United States is presented.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Synthesis of Temporal Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10912v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an automata-based algorithm to synthesize omega-regular causes for omega-regular effects on executions of a reactive system, such as counterexamples uncovered by a model checker. Our theory is a generalization of temporal causality, which has recently been proposed as a framework for drawing causal relationships between trace properties on a given trace. So far, algorithms exist only for verifying a single causal relationship and, as an extension, cause synthesis through enumeration, which is complete only for a small fragment of effect properties. This work presents the first complete cause-synthesis algorithm for the class of omega-regular effects. We show that in this case, causes are guaranteed to be omega-regular themselves and can be computed as, e.g., nondeterministic B\"uchi automata. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of this algorithm with a prototype tool and evaluate its performance for cause synthesis and cause checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-World Graph Analysis: Techniques for Static, Dynamic, and Temporal Communities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10824v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are widely used in various fields of computer science. They have also found application in unrelated areas, leading to a diverse range of problems. These problems can be modeled as relationships between entities in various contexts, such as social networks, protein interactions in cells, and route maps. Therefore it is logical to analyze these data structures with diverse approaches, whether they are numerical or structural, global or local, approximate or exact. In particular, the concept of community plays an important role in local structural analysis, as it is able to highlight the composition of the underlying graph while providing insights into what the organization and importance of the nodes in a network look like. This thesis pursues the goal of extracting knowledge from different kinds of graphs, including static, dynamic, and temporal graphs, with a particular focus on their community substructures. To tackle this task we use combinatorial algorithms that can list all the communities in a graph according to different formalizations, such as cliques, $k$-graphlets, and $k$-cores. We first develop new algorithms to enumerate subgraphs, using traditional and novel techniques such as push-out amortization, and CPU cache analysis to boost their efficiency. We then extend these concepts to the analysis of real-world graphs across diverse domains, ranging from social networks to autonomous systems modeled as temporal graphs. In this field, there is currently no widely accepted adaptation, even for straightforward subgraphs like $k$-cores, and the available data is expanding both in terms of quantity and scale. As a result, our findings advance the state of the art both from a theoretical and a practical perspective and can be used in a static or dynamic setting to further speed up and refine graph analysis techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[STLCCP: An Efficient Convex Optimization-based Framework for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09441v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is capable of expressing a broad range of temporal properties that controlled dynamical systems must satisfy. In the literature, both mixed-integer programming (MIP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) methods have been applied to solve optimal control problems with STL specifications. However, neither approach has succeeded in solving problems with complex long-horizon STL specifications within a realistic timeframe. This study proposes a new optimization framework, called \textit{STLCCP}, which explicitly incorporates several structures of STL to mitigate this issue. The core of our framework is a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, which converts the original program into a difference of convex (DC) programs. This program is then solved as a convex quadratic program sequentially, based on the convex-concave procedure (CCP). Our numerical experiments on several commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that this framework can effectively handle complex scenarios over long horizons, which have been challenging to address even using state-of-the-art optimization methods.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Historically Relevant Event Structuring for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10621v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of (1) investigating the influences of multi-granularity interactions across recent snapshots and (2) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, especially events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring ($\mathsf{HisRES}$). Concretely, $\mathsf{HisRES}$ comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, $\mathsf{HisRES}$ incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of $\mathsf{HisRES}$ and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Knowledge Question Answering via Abstract Reasoning Induction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09149v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the challenge of enhancing temporal knowledge reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs often struggle with this task, leading to the generation of inaccurate or misleading responses. This issue mainly arises from their limited ability to handle evolving factual knowledge and complex temporal logic. To overcome these limitations, we propose Abstract Reasoning Induction (ARI) framework, which divides temporal reasoning into two distinct phases: Knowledge-agnostic and Knowledge-based. This framework offers factual knowledge support to LLMs while minimizing the incorporation of extraneous noisy data. Concurrently, informed by the principles of constructivism, ARI provides LLMs the capability to engage in proactive, self-directed learning from both correct and incorrect historical reasoning samples. By teaching LLMs to actively construct knowledge and methods, it can significantly boosting their temporal reasoning abilities. Our approach achieves remarkable improvements, with relative gains of 29.7% and 9.27% on two temporal QA datasets, underscoring its efficacy in advancing temporal reasoning in LLMs. The code can be found at https://github.com/czy1999/ARI-QA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024. 17 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[How Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial-Temporal Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14192v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Timeline-based Sentence Decomposition with In-Context Learning for Temporal Fact Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10288v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facts extraction is pivotal for constructing knowledge graphs. Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction. In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text. Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts. In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. To this end, we introduce TSDRE, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset. Our experiments show that TSDRE achieves state-of-the-art results on both HyperRED-Temporal and ComplexTRED datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Spatial Object Relations Modeling for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15691v2)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task where an agent is required to navigate to a natural language described location via vision observations. The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMCEN: An Attention Masking-based Contrastive Event Network for Two-stage Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10346v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) can effectively model the ever-evolving nature of real-world knowledge, and their completeness and enhancement can be achieved by reasoning new events from existing ones. However, reasoning accuracy is adversely impacted due to an imbalance between new and recurring events in the datasets. To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning. Therefore, AMCEN refines the prediction scope with the results of the contrastive event classification, followed by utilizing attention masking-based decoders to finalize the specific outcomes. The results of our experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of AMCEN. Especially, the considerable improvements in Hits@1 prove that AMCEN can make more precise predictions about future occurrences.</p></details> |  |

With the advancements in RNNs, CNNs, and other non-generative techniques, researchers have explored their application in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies within spatial-temporal data. However, the emergence of generative techniques such as LLMs, SSL, Seq2Seq and diffusion models has opened up new possibilities for enhancing spatial-temporal data mining further. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of generative technique-based spatial-temporal methods and introduces a standardized framework specifically designed for the spatial-temporal data mining pipeline. By offering a detailed review and a novel taxonomy of spatial-temporal methodology utilizing generative techniques, the paper enables a deeper understanding of the various techniques employed in this field. Furthermore, the paper highlights promising future research directions, urging researchers to delve deeper into spatial-temporal data mining. It emphasizes the need to explore untapped opportunities and push the boundaries of knowledge to unlock new insights and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spatial-temporal data mining. By integrating generative techniques and providing a standardized framework, the paper contributes to advancing the field and encourages researchers to explore the vast potential of generative techniques in spatial-temporal data mining.</p></details> | 19 pages |

While the standard self attention only makes use of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through the singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that self attention compresses the contributions from both queries and keys in the space spanned by the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We show the improved performance of the easy-attention method in the Lorenz system, a turbulence shear flow and a model of a nuclear reactor.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |

For streaming data such as news or social media, models are commonly trained on a fixed corpus from a certain period of time, and they can become obsolete due to the dynamism and evolving nature of online content. This paper focuses on temporal shifts in social media and, in particular, Twitter. We propose a unified evaluation scheme to assess the performance of language models (LMs) under temporal shift on standard social media tasks. LMs are tested on five diverse social media NLP tasks under different temporal settings, which revealed two important findings: (i) the decrease in performance under temporal shift is consistent across different models for entity-focused tasks such as named entity recognition or disambiguation, and hate speech detection, but not significant in the other tasks analysed (i.e., topic and sentiment classification); and (ii) continuous pre-training on the test period does not improve the temporal adaptability of LMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the US, which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood hematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukemia and lymphoma.</p></details> |  |

Our method advances existing pose estimation frameworks by improving robustness and flexibility without requiring direct 3D annotations. At the core of our method, a pose compiler module refines predictions from a 2D keypoints estimator that operates on a single image by leveraging temporal and cross-view information. Our novel cross-view fusion strategy is scalable to any number of cameras, while our synthetic data generation strategy ensures generalization across diverse actors, scenes, and viewpoints. Finally, UPose3D leverages the prediction uncertainty of both the 2D keypoint estimator and the pose compiler module. This provides robustness to outliers and noisy data, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution settings. In addition, for in-distribution settings, UPose3D yields a performance rivaling methods that rely on 3D annotated data, while being the state-of-the-art among methods relying only on 2D supervision.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is an expressive formal language used to describe spatial-temporal properties with interpretability. This paper introduces TLINet, a neural-symbolic framework for learning STL formulas. The computation in TLINet is differentiable, enabling the usage of off-the-shelf gradient-based tools during the learning process. In contrast to existing approaches, we introduce approximation methods for max operator designed specifically for temporal logic-based gradient techniques, ensuring the correctness of STL satisfaction evaluation. Our framework not only learns the structure but also the parameters of STL formulas, allowing flexible combinations of operators and various logical structures. We validate TLINet against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that our approach outperforms these baselines in terms of interpretability, compactness, rich expressibility, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a natural interpretation of this problem in temporal graphs, whose edge sets change over time. This problem is NP-complete even when restricted to temporal graphs whose underlying graph is a path, but we obtain two polynomial-time algorithms for restricted cases. In the static setting, it is well-known that a graph is a disjoint union of cliques if and only if it contains no induced copy of $P_3$; we demonstrate that no general characterisation involving sets of at most four vertices can exist in the temporal setting, but obtain a complete characterisation involving forbidden configurations on at most five vertices. This characterisation gives rise to an FPT algorithm parameterised simultaneously by the permitted number of modifications and the lifetime of the temporal graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures.

| **[TAnet: A New Temporal Attention Network for EEG-based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding with a Short Decision Window](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05819v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) is used to determine the direction of a listener's attention to a speaker by analyzing her/his electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This study aimed to further improve the performance of ASAD with a short decision window (i.e., <1 s) rather than with long decision windows ranging from 1 to 5 seconds in previous studies. An end-to-end temporal attention network (i.e., TAnet) was introduced in this work. TAnet employs a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, which can more effectively capture the interactions among time steps in collected EEG signals and efficiently assign corresponding weights to those EEG time steps. Experiments demonstrated that, compared with the CNN-based method and recent ASAD methods, TAnet provided improved decoding performance in the KUL dataset, with decoding accuracies of 92.4% (decision window 0.1 s), 94.9% (0.25 s), 95.1% (0.3 s), 95.4% (0.4 s), and 95.5% (0.5 s) with short decision windows (i.e., <1 s). As a new ASAD model with a short decision window, TAnet can potentially facilitate the design of EEG-controlled intelligent hearing aids and sound recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLMs at Evaluating Temporal Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08460v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the urgent need for evolving evaluation methodologies that keep pace with improvements in language comprehension and information processing. However, traditional benchmarks, which are often static, fail to capture the continually changing information landscape, leading to a disparity between the perceived and actual effectiveness of LLMs in ever-changing real-world scenarios. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not adequately measure the models' capabilities over a broader temporal range or their adaptability over time. We examine current LLMs in terms of temporal generalization and bias, revealing that various temporal biases emerge in both language likelihood and prognostic prediction. This serves as a caution for LLM practitioners to pay closer attention to mitigating temporal biases. Also, we propose an evaluation framework Freshbench for dynamically generating benchmarks from the most recent real-world prognostication prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/FreshBench. The dataset will be released soon.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Airport Delay Prediction with Temporal Fusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08293v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since flight delay hurts passengers, airlines, and airports, its prediction becomes crucial for the decision-making of all stakeholders in the aviation industry and thus has been attempted by various previous research. However, previous delay predictions are often categorical and at a highly aggregated level. To improve that, this study proposes to apply the novel Temporal Fusion Transformer model and predict numerical airport arrival delays at quarter hour level for U.S. top 30 airports. Inputs to our model include airport demand and capacity forecasts, historic airport operation efficiency information, airport wind and visibility conditions, as well as enroute weather and traffic conditions. The results show that our model achieves satisfactory performance measured by small prediction errors on the test set. In addition, the interpretability analysis of the model outputs identifies the important input factors for delay prediction.</p></details> |  |

Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has identified temporal and contextual characteristics in humans' neural encoding of speech that may facilitate this temporal processing. In this study, we simulated similar analyses with representations extracted from a computational model that was trained on unlabelled speech with the learning objective of predicting upcoming acoustics. Our simulations revealed temporal dynamics similar to those in brain signals, implying that these properties can arise without linguistic knowledge. Another property shared between brains and the model is that the encoding patterns of phonemes support some degree of cross-context generalization. However, we found evidence that the effectiveness of these generalizations depends on the specific contexts, which suggests that this analysis alone is insufficient to support the presence of context-invariant encoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CogSci 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Tidy Framework and Infrastructure to Systematically Assemble Spatio-temporal Indexes from Multivariate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05812v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Interest Network for User Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08487v3)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User response prediction is essential in industrial recommendation systems, such as online display advertising. Among all the features in recommendation models, user behaviors are among the most critical. Many works have revealed that a user's behavior reflects her interest in the candidate item, owing to the semantic or temporal correlation between behaviors and the candidate. While the literature has individually examined each of these correlations, researchers have yet to analyze them in combination, that is, the semantic-temporal correlation. We empirically measure this correlation and observe intuitive yet robust patterns. We then examine several popular user interest models and find that, surprisingly, none of them learn such correlation well. To fill this gap, we propose a Temporal Interest Network (TIN) to capture the semantic-temporal correlation simultaneously between behaviors and the target. We achieve this by incorporating target-aware temporal encoding, in addition to semantic encoding, to represent behaviors and the target. Furthermore, we conduct explicit 4-way interaction by deploying target-aware attention and target-aware representation to capture both semantic and temporal correlation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two popular public datasets, and our proposed TIN outperforms the best-performing baselines by 0.43% and 0.29% on GAUC, respectively. During online A/B testing in Tencent's advertising platform, TIN achieves 1.65% cost lift and 1.93% GMV lift over the base model. It has been successfully deployed in production since October 2023, serving the WeChat Moments traffic. We have released our code at https://github.com/zhouxy1003/TIN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-Rigid Designators in Modal and Temporal Free Description Logics (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07656v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Definite descriptions, such as 'the General Chair of KR 2024', are a semantically transparent device for object identification in knowledge representation. In first-order modal logic, definite descriptions have been widely investigated for their non-rigidity, which allows them to designate different objects (or none at all) at different states. We propose expressive modal description logics with non-rigid definite descriptions and names, and investigate decidability and complexity of the satisfaction problem. We first systematically link satisfiability for the one-variable fragment of first-order modal logic with counting to our modal description logics. Then, we prove a promising NEXPTIME-completeness result for concept satisfiability for the fundamental epistemic multi-agent logic $\mathbf{S5}^{n}$ and its neighbours, and show that some expressive logics that are undecidable with constant domain become decidable (but Ackermann-hard) with expanding domains. Finally, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of decidability of temporal logics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TUNeS: A Temporal U-Net with Self-Attention for Video-based Surgical Phase Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09997v4)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enable context-aware computer assistance in the operating room of the future, cognitive systems need to understand automatically which surgical phase is being performed by the medical team. The primary source of information for surgical phase recognition is typically video, which presents two challenges: extracting meaningful features from the video stream and effectively modeling temporal information in the sequence of visual features. For temporal modeling, attention mechanisms have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we explore design choices for attention in existing temporal models for surgical phase recognition and propose a novel approach that uses attention more effectively and does not require hand-crafted constraints: TUNeS, an efficient and simple temporal model that incorporates self-attention at the core of a convolutional U-Net structure. In addition, we propose to train the feature extractor, a standard CNN, together with an LSTM on preferably long video segments, i.e., with long temporal context. In our experiments, almost all temporal models performed better on top of feature extractors that were trained with longer temporal context. On these contextualized features, TUNeS achieves state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset. This study offers new insights on how to use attention mechanisms to build accurate and efficient temporal models for surgical phase recognition. Implementing automatic surgical phase recognition is essential to automate the analysis and optimization of surgical workflows and to enable context-aware computer assistance during surgery, thus ultimately improving patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code released at https://gitlab.com/nct_tso_public/tunes</p></details> |

However, the pursuit of accuracy in current studies leads to large, long-timestep SNNs, conflicting with the resource constraints of these devices. In order to design lightweight and efficient SNNs, we propose a new approach named LitE-SNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal compression into the automated network design process. Spatially, we present a novel Compressive Convolution block (CompConv) to expand the search space to support pruning and mixed-precision quantization. Temporally, we are the first to propose a compressive timestep search to identify the optimal number of timesteps under specific computation cost constraints. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization to simultaneously learn the architecture parameters and spatial-temporal compression strategies to achieve high performance while minimizing memory and computation costs. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Google Speech Command datasets demonstrate our proposed LitE-SNNs can achieve competitive or even higher accuracy with remarkably smaller model sizes and fewer computation costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Keyframe Interpolation for Any Human Skeleton via Temporally Consistent Point Cloud Sampling and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07444v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the character animation field, modern supervised keyframe interpolation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in constructing natural human motions from sparse pose definitions. As supervised models, large motion datasets are necessary to facilitate the learning process; however, since motion is represented with fixed hierarchical skeletons, such datasets are incompatible for skeletons outside the datasets' native configurations. Consequently, the expected availability of a motion dataset for desired skeletons severely hinders the feasibility of learned interpolation in practice. To combat this limitation, we propose Point Cloud-based Motion Representation Learning (PC-MRL), an unsupervised approach to enabling cross-compatibility between skeletons for motion interpolation learning. PC-MRL consists of a skeleton obfuscation strategy using temporal point cloud sampling, and an unsupervised skeleton reconstruction method from point clouds. We devise a temporal point-wise K-nearest neighbors loss for unsupervised learning. Moreover, we propose First-frame Offset Quaternion (FOQ) and Rest Pose Augmentation (RPA) strategies to overcome necessary limitations of our unsupervised point cloud-to-skeletal motion process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-MRL in motion interpolation for desired skeletons without supervision from native datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |

Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) has demonstrated its ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) a promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), we proposed a new neural networks architecture inspired by KAN and the LSTM, the Temporal Kolomogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTRL: Continuous-Time Representation Learning on Temporal Heterogeneous Information Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08013v1)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive representation learning on temporal heterogeneous graphs is crucial for scalable deep learning on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) which are time-varying, such as citation networks. However, most existing approaches are not inductive and thus cannot handle new nodes or edges. Moreover, previous temporal graph embedding methods are often trained with the temporal link prediction task to simulate the link formation process of temporal graphs, while ignoring the evolution of high-order topological structures on temporal graphs. To fill these gaps, we propose a Continuous-Time Representation Learning (CTRL) model on temporal HINs. To preserve heterogeneous node features and temporal structures, CTRL integrates three parts in a single layer, they are 1) a \emph{heterogeneous attention} unit that measures the semantic correlation between nodes, 2) a \emph{edge-based Hawkes process} to capture temporal influence between heterogeneous nodes, and 3) \emph{dynamic centrality} that indicates the dynamic importance of a node. We train the CTRL model with a future event (a subgraph) prediction task to capture the evolution of the high-order network structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our model significantly boosts performance and outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[FineParser: A Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Action Parser for Human-centric Action Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06887v1)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing action quality assessment (AQA) methods mainly learn deep representations at the video level for scoring diverse actions. Due to the lack of a fine-grained understanding of actions in videos, they harshly suffer from low credibility and interpretability, thus insufficient for stringent applications, such as Olympic diving events. We argue that a fine-grained understanding of actions requires the model to perceive and parse actions in both time and space, which is also the key to the credibility and interpretability of the AQA technique. Based on this insight, we propose a new fine-grained spatial-temporal action parser named \textbf{FineParser}. It learns human-centric foreground action representations by focusing on target action regions within each frame and exploiting their fine-grained alignments in time and space to minimize the impact of invalid backgrounds during the assessment. In addition, we construct fine-grained annotations of human-centric foreground action masks for the FineDiving dataset, called \textbf{FineDiving-HM}. With refined annotations on diverse target action procedures, FineDiving-HM can promote the development of real-world AQA systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FineParser, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods while supporting more tasks of fine-grained action understanding.

Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance. The code is available at https://github.com/chen-si-jia/Trajectory-Long-tail-Distribution-for-MOT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024!</p></details> |
| **[Language-Driven Interactive Traffic Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15388v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic trajectory generation with natural language control is pivotal for advancing autonomous vehicle technology. However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands. Our code is available at https://github.com/X1a-jk/InteractTraj.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for Model Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model ensures the drivability of the predicted trajectory by integrating non-holonomic motion constraints and physical constraints into the generative prediction module. Central to the architecture of cVMD is its capacity to perform uncertainty quantification, a feature that is crucial in safety-critical applications. By integrating the quantified uncertainty into the prediction process, the cVMD's trajectory prediction performance is improved considerably. The model's performance was evaluated using the publicly available highD dataset. Experiments show that the proposed architecture achieves competitive trajectory prediction accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models, while providing guaranteed drivable trajectories and uncertainty quantification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference Workshops (CVPRW) 2024</p></details> |

At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Existing traditional or learning-based methods face challenges in adequately addressing all these aspects. In response, this paper proposes a novel component termed the Logical Guidance Layer (LGL), designed for seamless integration into autonomous driving trajectory planning frameworks, specifically tailored for highway scenarios. The LGL guides the trajectory planning with a local target area determined through scenario reasoning, scenario evaluation, and guidance area calculation. Integrating the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, the LGL ensures formal safety guarantees while accommodating various user preferences defined by logical formulae. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the LGL in achieving a balance between safety and efficiency, and meeting user preferences in autonomous highway driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ITSC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Camera Trajectory Control with Enhanced Immersion for Virtual Cinematography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17041v3)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User-generated cinematic creations are gaining popularity as our daily entertainment, yet it is a challenge to master cinematography for producing immersive contents. Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Methods for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |
| **[PLM4Traj: Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories play a vital role in various spatio-temporal data mining tasks. Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 tables</p></details> |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |

Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for Clustering Functional Trajectories over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11358v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional concurrent, or varying-coefficient, regression models are commonly used in biomedical and clinical settings to investigate how the relation between an outcome and observed covariate varies as a function of another covariate. In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |
| **[Dreamer XL: Towards High-Resolution Text-to-3D Generation via Trajectory Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11252v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times. A video of the proposed method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDbaeLfcN4.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Distributional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08367v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous efforts have been put forth on predicting pedestrian trajectory with generative models to accommodate uncertainty and multi-modality in human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15881v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Creating Geospatial Trajectories from Human Trafficking Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06130v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trafficking is a crime that affects the lives of millions of people across the globe. Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, sending raw data containing personal, sensitive information to cloud computing nodes may lead to privacy exposure issue.The privacy-preserving matrix completion is a useful approach to perform matrix completion while preserving privacy. In this paper, we propose a high-performance method for privacy-preserving matrix completion. First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement.

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |

Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

| **[CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

By employing a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that combines autoencoders and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), our approach autonomously pinpoints critical transitional points in continuous, unlabeled motion data, thus significantly reducing dependence on extensively labeled datasets. This innovative method dynamically adjusts motion trajectories using conditional variables, significantly enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of robotic actions under dynamic conditions while also reducing the computational overhead associated with traditional robotic programming methods. Our experimental validation demonstrates superior learning efficiency and adaptability compared to existing techniques, paving the way for advanced applications in industrial and service robotics.</p></details> |  |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

Supervised neural models represent the current state-of-the-art. Recent security applications require this task to be rapidly employed in environments that may differ from the data used to train such models for which there is little training data. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to support eventual deployment in security applications. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

Current research has primarily focused on the development of tracking algorithms and enhancement of post-processing techniques. Yet, there has been a lack of thorough examination concerning the nature of tracking data it self. In this study, we pioneer an exploration into the distribution patterns of tracking data and identify a pronounced long-tail distribution issue within existing MOT datasets. We note a significant imbalance in the distribution of trajectory lengths across different pedestrians, a phenomenon we refer to as ``pedestrians trajectory long-tail distribution''. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a bespoke strategy designed to mitigate the effects of this skewed distribution. Specifically, we propose two data augmentation strategies, including Stationary Camera View Data Augmentation (SVA) and Dynamic Camera View Data Augmentation (DVA) , designed for viewpoint states and the Group Softmax (GS) module for Re-ID. SVA is to backtrack and predict the pedestrian trajectory of tail classes, and DVA is to use diffusion model to change the background of the scene. GS divides the pedestrians into unrelated groups and performs softmax operation on each group individually. Our proposed strategies can be integrated into numerous existing tracking systems, and extensive experimentation validates the efficacy of our method in reducing the influence of long-tail distribution on multi-object tracking performance.

However, previous methods focus on individual traffic participant trajectory generation, thus failing to account for the complexity of interactive traffic dynamics. In this work, we propose InteractTraj, the first language-driven traffic trajectory generator that can generate interactive traffic trajectories. InteractTraj interprets abstract trajectory descriptions into concrete formatted interaction-aware numerical codes and learns a mapping between these formatted codes and the final interactive trajectories. To interpret language descriptions, we propose a language-to-code encoder with a novel interaction-aware encoding strategy. To produce interactive traffic trajectories, we propose a code-to-trajectory decoder with interaction-aware feature aggregation that synergizes vehicle interactions with the environmental map and the vehicle moves. Extensive experiments show our method demonstrates superior performance over previous SoTA methods, offering a more realistic generation of interactive traffic trajectories with high controllability via diverse natural language commands.

| **[Trajectory-Based Multi-Objective Hyperparameter Optimization for Model Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15303v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models inherently involves a resource-intensive and noisy iterative learning procedure that allows epoch-wise monitoring of the model performance. However, in multi-objective hyperparameter optimization scenarios, the insights gained from the iterative learning procedure typically remain underutilized. We notice that tracking the model performance across multiple epochs under a hyperparameter setting creates a trajectory in the objective space and that trade-offs along the trajectories are often overlooked despite their potential to offer valuable insights to decision-making for model retraining. Therefore, in this study, we propose to enhance the multi-objective hyperparameter optimization problem by having training epochs as an additional decision variable to incorporate trajectory information. Correspondingly, we present a novel trajectory-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization algorithm characterized by two features: 1) an acquisition function that captures the improvement made by the predictive trajectory of any hyperparameter setting and 2) a multi-objective early stopping mechanism that determines when to terminate the trajectory to maximize epoch efficiency. Numerical experiments on diverse synthetic simulations and hyperparameter tuning benchmarks indicate that our algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art multi-objective optimizers in both locating better trade-offs and tuning efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, it encounters two main challenges in multi-drone collaboration settings. The expansive aerial observations make it difficult to generate precise Bird's Eye View (BEV) representations. Besides, excessive interactions can not meet real-time prediction requirements within the constrained drone-based communication bandwidth. To address these problems, we propose a novel framework named "Drones Help Drones" (DHD). Firstly, we incorporate the ground priors provided by the drone's inclined observation to estimate the distance between objects and drones, leading to more precise BEV generation. Secondly, we design a selective mechanism based on the local feature discrepancy to prioritize the critical information contributing to prediction tasks during inter-drone interactions. Additionally, we create the first dataset for multi-drone collaborative prediction, named "Air-Co-Pred", and conduct quantitative and qualitative experiments to validate the effectiveness of our DHD framework.The results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, DHD reduces position deviation in BEV representations by over 20% and requires only a quarter of the transmission ratio for interactions while achieving comparable prediction performance. Moreover, DHD also shows promising generalization to the collaborative 3D object detection in CoPerception-UAVs.</p></details> |  |

At the control center, offline motion planning is fundamental in the computation of optimized trajectories accounting for the system's constraints. Smooth movements, collision and forbidden areas avoidance, target visibility and energy consumption are all important factors to consider to be able to generate feasible and optimal plans. When mobile manipulators (terrestrial, aerial) are employed, the base and the arm movements are often separately planned, ultimately resulting in sub-optimal solutions. We propose an Optimal Whole Body Planner (OptiWB) based on Discrete Dynamic Programming (DDP) and optimal interpolation. Kinematic redundancy is exploited for collision and forbidden areas avoidance, and to improve target illumination and visibility from onboard cameras. The planner, implemented in ROS (Robot Operating System), interfaces 3DROCS, a mission planner used in several programs of the European Space Agency (ESA) to support planetary exploration surface missions and part of the ExoMars Rover's planning software. The proposed approach is exercised on a simplified version of the Analog-1 Interact rover by ESA, a 7-DOFs robotic arm mounted on a four wheels non-holonomic platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Constrained Diffusion Models and Numerical Solvers for Efficient and Robust Non-Convex Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05571v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need to solve open-loop optimal control problems with computational efficiency and reliable constraint satisfaction, we introduce a general framework that combines diffusion models and numerical optimization solvers. Optimal control problems are rarely solvable in closed form, hence they are often transcribed into numerical trajectory optimization problems, which then require initial guesses. These initial guesses are supplied in our framework by diffusion models. To mitigate the effect of samples that violate the problem constraints, we develop a novel constrained diffusion model to approximate the true distribution of locally optimal solutions with an additional constraint violation loss in training. To further enhance the robustness, the diffusion samples as initial guesses are fed to the numerical solver to refine and derive final optimal (and hence feasible) solutions. Experimental evaluations on three tasks verify the improved constraint satisfaction and computational efficiency with 4$\times$ to 30$\times$ acceleration using our proposed framework, which generalizes across trajectory optimization problems and scales well with problem complexity.</p></details> |  |

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 6 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Safe and Personalizable Logical Guidance for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13704v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles necessitate a delicate balance between safety, efficiency, and user preferences in trajectory planning. Existing traditional or learning-based methods face challenges in adequately addressing all these aspects. In response, this paper proposes a novel component termed the Logical Guidance Layer (LGL), designed for seamless integration into autonomous driving trajectory planning frameworks, specifically tailored for highway scenarios. The LGL guides the trajectory planning with a local target area determined through scenario reasoning, scenario evaluation, and guidance area calculation. Integrating the Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) model, the LGL ensures formal safety guarantees while accommodating various user preferences defined by logical formulae. Experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness of the LGL in achieving a balance between safety and efficiency, and meeting user preferences in autonomous highway driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ITSC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v2)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyper-sd.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Camera Trajectory Control with Enhanced Immersion for Virtual Cinematography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17041v3)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User-generated cinematic creations are gaining popularity as our daily entertainment, yet it is a challenge to master cinematography for producing immersive contents. Many existing automatic methods focus on roughly controlling predefined shot types or movement patterns, which struggle to engage viewers with the circumstances of the actor. Real-world cinematographic rules show that directors can create immersion by comprehensively synchronizing the camera with the actor. Inspired by this strategy, we propose a deep camera control framework that enables actor-camera synchronization in three aspects, considering frame aesthetics, spatial action, and emotional status in the 3D virtual stage. Following rule-of-thirds, our framework first modifies the initial camera placement to position the actor aesthetically. This adjustment is facilitated by a self-supervised adjustor that analyzes frame composition via camera projection. We then design a GAN model that can adversarially synthesize fine-grained camera movement based on the physical action and psychological state of the actor, using an encoder-decoder generator to map kinematics and emotional variables into camera trajectories. Moreover, we incorporate a regularizer to align the generated stylistic variances with specific emotional categories and intensities. The experimental results show that our proposed method yields immersive cinematic videos of high quality, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Live examples can be found in the supplementary video.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Methods for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we address the limitations inherent in most existing vehicle trajectory prediction methodologies that indiscriminately incorporate all agents within a predetermined proximity when accounting for inter-agent interactions. These approaches commonly employ attention-based architecture or graph neural networks for encoding interactions, which introduces three challenges: (i) The indiscriminate selection of all nearby agents substantially escalates the computational demands of the model, particularly in those interaction-rich scenarios. (ii) Moreover, the simplistic feature extraction of current time agents falls short of adequately capturing the nuanced dynamics of interactions. (iii) Compounded by the inherently low interpretability of attention mechanism and graph neural networks, there is a propensity for the model to allocate unreliable correlation coefficients to certain agents, adversely impacting the accuracy of trajectory predictions. To mitigate these issues, we introduce ASPILin, a novel approach that enhances the selection of interacting agents by considering their current and future lanes, extending this consideration across all historical frames. Utilizing the states of the agents, we estimate the nearest future distance between agents and the time needed to reach this distance. Then, combine these with their current distances to derive a physical correlation coefficient to encode interactions. Experiments conducted on popular trajectory prediction datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |
| **[PLM4Traj: Cognizing Movement Patterns and Travel Purposes from Trajectories with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12459v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal trajectories play a vital role in various spatio-temporal data mining tasks. Developing a versatile trajectory learning approach that can adapt to different tasks while ensuring high accuracy is crucial. This requires effectively extracting movement patterns and travel purposes embedded in trajectories. However, this task is challenging due to limitations in the size and quality of available trajectory datasets. On the other hand, pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown great success in adapting to different tasks by training on large-scale, high-quality corpus datasets. Given the similarities between trajectories and sentences, there is potential in leveraging PLMs to enhance the development of a versatile and effective trajectory learning method. Nevertheless, vanilla PLMs are not tailored to handle the unique spatio-temporal features present in trajectories and lack the capability to extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. To overcome these obstacles, we propose a model called PLM4Traj that effectively utilizes PLMs to model trajectories. PLM4Traj leverages the strengths of PLMs to create a versatile trajectory learning approach while addressing the limitations of vanilla PLMs in modeling trajectories. Firstly, PLM4Traj incorporates a novel trajectory semantic embedder that enables PLMs to process spatio-temporal features in trajectories and extract movement patterns and travel purposes from them. Secondly, PLM4Traj introduces a novel trajectory prompt that integrates movement patterns and travel purposes into PLMs, while also allowing the model to adapt to various tasks. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets and two representative tasks demonstrate that PLM4Traj successfully achieves its design goals.

However, there are still open questions about the effects of perturbations on inputs other than state histories, and how these attacks impact downstream planning and control. In this paper, we conduct a sensitivity analysis on two trajectory prediction models, Trajectron++ and AgentFormer. The analysis reveals that between all inputs, almost all of the perturbation sensitivities for both models lie only within the most recent position and velocity states. We additionally demonstrate that, despite dominant sensitivity on state history perturbations, an undetectable image map perturbation made with the Fast Gradient Sign Method can induce large prediction error increases in both models, revealing that these trajectory predictors are, in fact, susceptible to image-based attacks. Using an optimization-based planner and example perturbations crafted from sensitivity results, we show how these attacks can cause a vehicle to come to a sudden stop from moderate driving speeds.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 1 tables</p></details> |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |

Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |

Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |

This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

| **[ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times. A video of the proposed method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDbaeLfcN4.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Distributional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08367v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous efforts have been put forth on predicting pedestrian trajectory with generative models to accommodate uncertainty and multi-modality in human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15881v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Creating Geospatial Trajectories from Human Trafficking Text Corpora](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06130v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trafficking is a crime that affects the lives of millions of people across the globe. Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

First,we use a lightweight encryption scheme to encrypt the raw data and then perform matrix completion using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Then,the complemented matrix is decrypted and compared with the original matrix to calculate the error. This method has faster speed with higher accuracy. The results of numerical experiments reveal that the proposed method is faster than other algorithms.</p></details> | 7 pages, 10 figures |

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement.

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |

Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, this paper presents a novel trajectory prediction model tailored for accuracy in the face of heterogeneous and uncertain traffic scenarios. At the heart of this model lies the Characterized Diffusion Module, an innovative module designed to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty. This module enriches the predictive process by infusing it with detailed semantic information, thereby enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy. Complementing this, our Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module captures the nuanced effects of traffic scenarios on vehicle dynamics across both spatial and temporal dimensions with remarkable effectiveness. Demonstrated through exhaustive evaluations, our model sets a new standard in trajectory prediction, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) datasets across both short and extended temporal spans. This performance underscores the model's unparalleled adaptability and efficacy in navigating complex traffic scenarios, including highways, urban streets, and intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

Evaluations on the Argoverse, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets underscore MFTraj's robustness and adaptability, outperforming numerous benchmarks even in data-challenged scenarios without the need for additional information such as HD maps or vectorized maps. Importantly, it maintains competitive performance even in scenarios with substantial missing data, on par with most existing state-of-the-art models. The results and methodology suggest a significant advancement in autonomous driving trajectory prediction, paving the way for safer and more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

By employing a cutting-edge deep learning architecture that combines autoencoders and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), our approach autonomously pinpoints critical transitional points in continuous, unlabeled motion data, thus significantly reducing dependence on extensively labeled datasets. This innovative method dynamically adjusts motion trajectories using conditional variables, significantly enhancing the flexibility and accuracy of robotic actions under dynamic conditions while also reducing the computational overhead associated with traditional robotic programming methods. Our experimental validation demonstrates superior learning efficiency and adaptability compared to existing techniques, paving the way for advanced applications in industrial and service robotics.</p></details> |  |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

Supervised neural models represent the current state-of-the-art. Recent security applications require this task to be rapidly employed in environments that may differ from the data used to train such models for which there is little training data. We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to support eventual deployment in security applications. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

The fact that LLMs can effectively generate sensible answers to a diverse range of queries suggests that they would be useful in customer support applications. While powerful, LLMs have been observed to be prone to hallucination which unfortunately makes their near term use in customer support applications challenging. To address this issue we present a system that allows us to use an LLM to augment our customer support advocates by re-framing the language modeling task as a discriminative classification task. In this framing, we seek to present the top-K best template responses for a customer support advocate to use when responding to a customer. We present the result of both offline and online experiments where we observed offline gains and statistically significant online lifts for our experimental system. Along the way, we present observed scaling curves for validation loss and top-K accuracy, resulted from model parameter ablation studies. We close by discussing the space of trade-offs with respect to model size, latency, and accuracy as well as and suggesting future applications to explore.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Reflect Human Citation Patterns with a Heightened Citation Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15739v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Citation practices are crucial in shaping the structure of scientific knowledge, yet they are often influenced by contemporary norms and biases. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 introduces a new dynamic to these practices. Interestingly, the characteristics and potential biases of references recommended by LLMs that entirely rely on their parametric knowledge, and not on search or retrieval-augmented generation, remain unexplored. Here, we analyze these characteristics in an experiment using a dataset of 166 papers from AAAI, NeurIPS, ICML, and ICLR, published after GPT-4's knowledge cut-off date, encompassing 3,066 references in total. In our experiment, GPT-4 was tasked with suggesting scholarly references for the anonymized in-text citations within these papers. Our findings reveal a remarkable similarity between human and LLM citation patterns, but with a more pronounced high citation bias in GPT-4, which persists even after controlling for publication year, title length, number of authors, and venue. Additionally, we observe a large consistency between the characteristics of GPT-4's existing and non-existent generated references, indicating the model's internalization of citation patterns. By analyzing citation graphs, we show that the references recommended by GPT-4 are embedded in the relevant citation context, suggesting an even deeper conceptual internalization of the citation networks. While LLMs can aid in citation generation, they may also amplify existing biases and introduce new ones, potentially skewing scientific knowledge dissemination. Our results underscore the need for identifying the model's biases and for developing balanced methods to interact with LLMs in general.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |
| **[ConvLLaVA: Hierarchical Backbones as Visual Encoder for Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15738v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-resolution Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encounter the challenges of excessive visual tokens and quadratic visual complexity. Current high-resolution LMMs address the quadratic complexity while still generating excessive visual tokens. However, the redundancy in visual tokens is the key problem as it leads to more substantial compute. To mitigate this issue, we propose ConvLLaVA, which employs ConvNeXt, a hierarchical backbone, as the visual encoder of LMM to replace Vision Transformer (ViT). ConvLLaVA compresses high-resolution images into information-rich visual features, effectively preventing the generation of excessive visual tokens. To enhance the capabilities of ConvLLaVA, we propose two critical optimizations. Since the low-resolution pretrained ConvNeXt underperforms when directly applied on high resolution, we update it to bridge the gap. Moreover, since ConvNeXt's original compression ratio is inadequate for much higher resolution inputs, we train a successive stage to further compress the visual tokens, thereby reducing redundancy. These optimizations enable ConvLLaVA to support inputs of 1536x1536 resolution generating only 576 visual tokens, capable of handling images of arbitrary aspect ratios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on mainstream benchmarks.

Though MLLMs have shown promising results in numerous high-level vision and vision-language tasks such as VQA and text-to-image, no works have demonstrated how low-level vision tasks can benefit from MLLMs. We find that most current MLLMs are blind to low-level features due to their design of vision modules, thus are inherently incapable for solving low-level vision tasks. In this work, we purpose $\textbf{LM4LV}$, a framework that enables a FROZEN LLM to solve a range of low-level vision tasks without any multi-modal data or prior. This showcases the LLM's strong potential in low-level vision and bridges the gap between MLLMs and low-level vision tasks. We hope this work can inspire new perspectives on LLMs and deeper understanding of their mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Despite the remarkable efficacy of code completion solutions in mainstream programming languages, their performance lags when applied to less ubiquitous formats such as OpenAPI definitions. This study evaluates the OpenAPI completion performance of GitHub Copilot, a prevalent commercial code completion tool, and proposes a set of task-specific optimizations leveraging Meta's open-source model Code Llama. A semantics-aware OpenAPI completion benchmark proposed in this research is used to perform a series of experiments through which the impact of various prompt-engineering and fine-tuning techniques on the Code Llama model's performance is analyzed. The fine-tuned Code Llama model reaches a peak correctness improvement of 55.2% over GitHub Copilot despite utilizing 25 times fewer parameters than the commercial solution's underlying Codex model. Additionally, this research proposes an enhancement to a widely used code infilling training technique, addressing the issue of underperformance when the model is prompted with context sizes smaller than those used during training.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the emergence of large multimodal models (LMMs) has shown transformative potential across various research tasks, such as visual comprehension and description. In this study, we explore the application of LMMs to demographic inference and introduce a benchmark for both quantitative and qualitative evaluation. Our findings indicate that LMMs possess advantages in zero-shot learning, interpretability, and handling uncurated 'in-the-wild' inputs, albeit with a propensity for off-target predictions. To enhance LMM performance and achieve comparability with supervised learning baselines, we propose a Chain-of-Thought augmented prompting approach, which effectively mitigates the off-target prediction issue.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICME 2024</p></details> |

However, most adapters generate consistent visual tokens, regardless of the specific objects of interest mentioned in the prompt. Since these adapters distribute equal attention to every detail in the image and focus on the entire scene, they may increase the cognitive load for LLMs, particularly when processing complex scenes. To alleviate this problem, we propose prompt-aware adapters. These adapters are designed with the capability to dynamically embed visual inputs based on the specific focus of the prompt. Specifically, prompt-aware adapters utilize both global and local textual features to capture the most relevant visual clues from the prompt at both coarse and fine granularity levels. This approach significantly enhances the ability of LLMs to understand and interpret visual content. Experiments on various visual question answering tasks, such as counting and position reasoning, demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt-aware adapters.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Do You See? Enhancing Zero-Shot Image Classification with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15668v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) has been effectively used for many computer vision tasks, including image classification. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective approach for zero-shot image classification using multimodal LLMs. By employing multimodal LLMs, we generate comprehensive textual representations from input images. These textual representations are then utilized to generate fixed-dimensional features in a cross-modal embedding space. Subsequently, these features are fused together to perform zero-shot classification using a linear classifier. Our method does not require prompt engineering for each dataset; instead, we use a single, straightforward, set of prompts across all datasets. We evaluated our method on several datasets, and our results demonstrate its remarkable effectiveness, surpassing benchmark accuracy on multiple datasets. On average over ten benchmarks, our method achieved an accuracy gain of 4.1 percentage points, with an increase of 6.8 percentage points on the ImageNet dataset, compared to prior methods. Our findings highlight the potential of multimodal LLMs to enhance computer vision tasks such as zero-shot image classification, offering a significant improvement over traditional methods.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, the research community has shown that LLMs are susceptible to various attacks but can also improve the security of diverse systems. However, besides enabling more secure systems, how well do open source LLMs behave as covertext distributions to, e.g., facilitate censorship resistant communication? In this paper, we explore the capabilities of open-source LLM-based covert channels. We approach this problem from the experimental side by empirically measuring the security vs. capacity of the open-source LLM model (Llama-7B) to assess how well it performs as a covert channel. Although our results indicate that such channels are not likely to achieve high practical bitrates, which depend on message length and model entropy, we also show that the chance for an adversary to detect covert communication is low. To ensure that our results can be used with the least effort as a general reference, we employ a conceptually simple and concise scheme and only assume public models.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing benchmarks for multilingual multimodal reasoning struggle to differentiate between models of varying performance; even language models without visual capabilities can easily achieve high scores. This leaves a comprehensive evaluation of leading multilingual multimodal models largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce M4U, a novel and challenging benchmark for assessing the capability of multi-discipline multilingual multimodal understanding and reasoning. M4U contains 8,931 samples covering 64 disciplines across 16 subfields in Science, Engineering, and Healthcare in Chinese, English, and German. Using M4U, we conduct extensive evaluations of 21 leading Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools. The evaluation results show that the state-of-the-art model, GPT-4o, achieves only 47.6% average accuracy on M4U. Additionally, we observe that the leading LMMs exhibit significant language preferences. Our in-depth analysis indicates that leading LMMs, including GPT-4o, suffer performance degradation when prompted with cross-lingual multimodal questions, such as images with key textual information in Chinese while the question is in German. We believe that M4U can serve as a crucial tool for systematically evaluating LMMs based on their multilingual multimodal reasoning capabilities and monitoring their development. The homepage, codes and data are public available.</p></details> | Work in progress |

To support academic research on GPTs, we introduce GPTZoo, a large-scale dataset comprising 730,420 GPT instances. Each instance includes rich metadata with 21 attributes describing its characteristics, as well as instructions, knowledge files, and third-party services utilized during its development. GPTZoo aims to provide researchers with a comprehensive and readily available resource to study the real-world applications, performance, and potential of GPTs. To facilitate efficient retrieval and analysis of GPTs, we also developed an automated command-line interface (CLI) that supports keyword-based searching of the dataset. To promote open research and innovation, the GPTZoo dataset will undergo continuous updates, and we are granting researchers public access to GPTZoo and its associated tools.</p></details> |  |

Despite their success, these models often produce 3D meshes with geometric inaccuracies, stemming from the inherent challenges of deducing 3D shapes solely from image data. In this work, we introduce a novel framework, the Large Image and Point Cloud Alignment Model (LAM3D), which utilizes 3D point cloud data to enhance the fidelity of generated 3D meshes. Our methodology begins with the development of a point-cloud-based network that effectively generates precise and meaningful latent tri-planes, laying the groundwork for accurate 3D mesh reconstruction. Building upon this, our Image-Point-Cloud Feature Alignment technique processes a single input image, aligning to the latent tri-planes to imbue image features with robust 3D information. This process not only enriches the image features but also facilitates the production of high-fidelity 3D meshes without the need for multi-view input, significantly reducing geometric distortions. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art high-fidelity 3D mesh reconstruction from a single image in just 6 seconds, and experiments on various datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

This suggests the problems are not caught before the code is released, which could be caused by many factors, like lack of awareness, limited efficacy of the existing vulnerability detection tools or the tools not being user-friendly. To help combat some issues with traditional vulnerability detection tools, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to assist in finding vulnerabilities in source code. LLMs have shown a remarkable ability to understand and generate code, underlining their potential in code-related tasks. The aim is to test multiple state-of-the-art LLMs and identify the best prompting strategies, allowing extraction of the best value from the LLMs. We provide an overview of the strengths and weaknesses of the LLM-based approach and compare the results to those of traditional static analysis tools. We find that LLMs can pinpoint many more issues than traditional static analysis tools, outperforming traditional tools in terms of recall and F1 scores. The results should benefit software developers and security analysts responsible for ensuring that the code is free of vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present VerMCTS, an approach to begin to resolve this issue by generating verified programs in Dafny and Coq. VerMCTS uses a logical verifier in concert with an LLM to guide a modified Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). This approach leverages the verifier to gain intermediate feedback inside the search algorithm by checking partial programs at each step to estimate an upper bound on the value function. To measure the performance of VerMCTS, we develop a new suite of multi-step verified programming problems in Dafny and Coq. In terms of pass@T, a new metric which computes the pass rate given a budget of T tokens sampled from the LLM, VerMCTS leads to more than a 30% absolute increase in average pass@5000 across the suite over repeated sampling from the base language model. Our code and benchmarks are available at https://github.com/namin/llm-verified-with-monte-carlo-tree-search .</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Exceptional Behavior Tests with Reasoning Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14619v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many popular programming languages, including C#, Java, and Python, support exceptions. Exceptions are thrown during program execution if an unwanted event happens, e.g., a method is invoked with an illegal argument value. Software developers write exceptional behavior tests (EBTs) to check that their code detects unwanted events and throws appropriate exceptions. Prior research studies have shown the importance of EBTs, but those studies also highlighted that developers put most of their efforts on "happy paths", e.g., paths without unwanted events. To help developers fill the gap, we present the first framework, dubbed exLong, that automatically generates EBTs. exLong is a large language model instruction-tuned from CodeLlama and embeds reasoning about traces that lead to throw statements, conditional expressions that guard throw statements, and non-exceptional behavior tests that execute similar traces. We compare exLong with the state-of-the-art models for test generation (CAT-LM) and one of the strongest foundation models (GPT3.5), as well as with analysis-based tools for test generation (Randoop and EvoSuite). Our results show that exLong outperforms existing models and tools. Furthermore, we contributed several pull requests to open-source projects and 23 EBTs generated by exLong were already accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAGER: Exact Gradient Inversion for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15586v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning works by aggregating locally computed gradients from multiple clients, thus enabling collaborative training without sharing private client data. However, prior work has shown that the data can actually be recovered by the server using so-called gradient inversion attacks. While these attacks perform well when applied on images, they are limited in the text domain and only permit approximate reconstruction of small batches and short input sequences. In this work, we propose DAGER, the first algorithm to recover whole batches of input text exactly. DAGER leverages the low-rank structure of self-attention layer gradients and the discrete nature of token embeddings to efficiently check if a given token sequence is part of the client data. We use this check to exactly recover full batches in the honest-but-curious setting without any prior on the data for both encoder- and decoder-based architectures using exhaustive heuristic search and a greedy approach, respectively. We provide an efficient GPU implementation of DAGER and show experimentally that it recovers full batches of size up to 128 on large language models (LLMs), beating prior attacks in speed (20x at same batch size), scalability (10x larger batches), and reconstruction quality (ROUGE-1/2 > 0.99).</p></details> |  |
| **[Meteor: Mamba-based Traversal of Rationale for Large Language and Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15574v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of large language and vision models (LLVMs) has been driven by advances in visual instruction tuning. Recently, open-source LLVMs have curated high-quality visual instruction tuning datasets and utilized additional vision encoders or multiple computer vision models in order to narrow the performance gap with powerful closed-source LLVMs. These advancements are attributed to multifaceted information required for diverse capabilities, including fundamental image understanding, real-world knowledge about common-sense and non-object concepts (e.g., charts, diagrams, symbols, signs, and math problems), and step-by-step procedures for solving complex questions. Drawing from the multifaceted information, we present a new efficient LLVM, Mamba-based traversal of rationales (Meteor), which leverages multifaceted rationale to enhance understanding and answering capabilities. To embed lengthy rationales containing abundant information, we employ the Mamba architecture, capable of processing sequential data with linear time complexity. We introduce a new concept of traversal of rationale that facilitates efficient embedding of rationale. Subsequently, the backbone multimodal language model (MLM) is trained to generate answers with the aid of rationale. Through these steps, Meteor achieves significant improvements in vision language performances across multiple evaluation benchmarks requiring diverse capabilities, without scaling up the model size or employing additional vision encoders and computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available in https://github.com/ByungKwanLee/Meteor</p></details> |

Due to its hardness, large-scale MKP instances are usually a target for metaheuristics, a context in which effective feasibility maintenance strategies are crucial. In 1998, Chu and Beasley proposed an effective heuristic repair that is still relevant for recent metaheuristics. However, due to its deterministic nature, the diversity of solutions such heuristic provides is insufficient for long runs. As a result, the search for new solutions ceases after a while. This paper proposes an efficiency-based randomization strategy for the heuristic repair that increases the variability of the repaired solutions without deteriorating quality and improves the overall results.</p></details> |  |

Among these, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) stands out for its parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), producing numerous off-the-shelf task-specific LoRA adapters. However, this approach requires explicit task intention selection, posing challenges for automatic task sensing and switching during inference with multiple existing LoRA adapters embedded in a single LLM. In this work, we introduce MeteoRA (Multiple-Tasks embedded LoRA), a scalable multi-knowledge LoRA fusion framework designed for LLMs. MeteoRA integrates various LoRA adapters in a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) style into the base LLM, enabling the model to automatically select the most pertinent adapter based on the task input. This advancement significantly enhances the LLM's capability to handle composite tasks that require different adapters to solve various components of the problem. Our evaluations, featuring the LlaMA2-13B and LlaMA3-8B base models equipped with off-the-shelf 28 LoRA adapters through MeteoRA, demonstrate equivalent performance with the individual adapters. Furthermore, both base models equipped with MeteoRA achieve superior performance in sequentially solving composite tasks with ten problems in only a single inference process, highlighting the ability of timely intention switching in MeteoRA embedded LLMs.</p></details> | 23 pages |

We consider smooth nonconvex finite-sum (empirical risk minimization) problems in this setup and introduce a new parallel method, Freya PAGE, designed to handle arbitrarily heterogeneous and asynchronous computations. By being robust to "stragglers" and adaptively ignoring slow computations, Freya PAGE offers significantly improved time complexity guarantees compared to all previous methods, including Asynchronous SGD, Rennala SGD, SPIDER, and PAGE, while requiring weaker assumptions. The algorithm relies on novel generic stochastic gradient collection strategies with theoretical guarantees that can be of interest on their own, and may be used in the design of future optimization methods. Furthermore, we establish a lower bound for smooth nonconvex finite-sum problems in the asynchronous setup, providing a fundamental time complexity limit. This lower bound is tight and demonstrates the optimality of Freya PAGE in the large-scale regime, i.e., when $\sqrt{m} \geq n$, where $n$ is # of workers, and $m$ is # of data samples.</p></details> | 43 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Sparse Matrix in Large Language Model Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15525v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LoRA and its variants have become popular parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods due to their ability to avoid excessive computational costs. However, an accuracy gap often exists between PEFT methods and full fine-tuning (FT), and this gap has yet to be systematically studied. In this work, we introduce a method for selecting sparse sub-matrices that aim to minimize the performance gap between PEFT vs. full fine-tuning (FT) while also reducing both fine-tuning computational cost and memory cost. Our Sparse Matrix Tuning (SMT) method begins by identifying the most significant sub-matrices in the gradient update, updating only these blocks during the fine-tuning process. In our experiments, we demonstrate that SMT consistently surpasses other PEFT baseline (e.g. LoRA and DoRA) in fine-tuning popular large language models such as LLaMA across a broad spectrum of tasks, while reducing the GPU memory footprint by 67% compared to FT. We also examine how the performance of LoRA and DoRA tends to plateau and decline as the number of trainable parameters increases, in contrast, our SMT method does not suffer from such issue.</p></details> | 14 pages |

Copyright traps have been proposed to be injected into the original content, improving content detectability in newly released LLMs. Traps, however, rely on the exact duplication of a unique text sequence, leaving them vulnerable to commonly deployed data deduplication techniques. We here propose the generation of fuzzy copyright traps, featuring slight modifications across duplication. When injected in the fine-tuning data of a 1.3B LLM, we show fuzzy trap sequences to be memorized nearly as well as exact duplicates. Specifically, the Membership Inference Attack (MIA) ROC AUC only drops from 0.90 to 0.87 when 4 tokens are replaced across the fuzzy duplicates. We also find that selecting replacement positions to minimize the exact overlap between fuzzy duplicates leads to similar memorization, while making fuzzy duplicates highly unlikely to be removed by any deduplication process. Lastly, we argue that the fact that LLMs memorize across fuzzy duplicates challenges the study of LLM memorization relying on naturally occurring duplicates. Indeed, we find that the commonly used training dataset, The Pile, contains significant amounts of fuzzy duplicates. This introduces a previously unexplored confounding factor in post-hoc studies of LLM memorization, and questions the effectiveness of (exact) data deduplication as a privacy protection technique.</p></details> |  |

Despite their widespread success, existing LLM agents are hindered by generating unreasonable experiment plans within this scenario. To this end, we present DS-Agent, a novel automatic framework that harnesses LLM agent and case-based reasoning (CBR). In the development stage, DS-Agent follows the CBR framework to structure an automatic iteration pipeline, which can flexibly capitalize on the expert knowledge from Kaggle, and facilitate consistent performance improvement through the feedback mechanism. Moreover, DS-Agent implements a low-resource deployment stage with a simplified CBR paradigm to adapt past successful solutions from the development stage for direct code generation, significantly reducing the demand on foundational capabilities of LLMs. Empirically, DS-Agent with GPT-4 achieves 100\% success rate in the development stage, while attaining 36\% improvement on average one pass rate across alternative LLMs in the deployment stage. In both stages, DS-Agent achieves the best rank in performance, costing \$1.60 and \$0.13 per run with GPT-4, respectively.

However majority of existing multilingual NLP benchmarks for LLMs provide evaluation data in only few languages with little linguistic diversity. In addition these benchmarks lack quality assessment against the respective state-of the art models. This study presents an in-depth examination of prominent LLMs; GPT-3.5-turbo, Llama2-7B-Chat, Bloomz 7B1 and Bloomz 3B, across 14 tasks using 15 Urdu datasets, in a zero-shot setting, and their performance against state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, has been compared and analysed. Our experiments show that SOTA models surpass all the encoder-decoder pre-trained language models in all Urdu NLP tasks with zero-shot learning. Our results further show that LLMs with fewer parameters, but more language specific data in the base model perform better than larger computational models, but low language data.</p></details> |  |

However, this information is typically presented as unstructured text in accompanying documentation, hampering their automated analysis and processing. In this work, we explore using large language models (LLM) and a set of prompting strategies to automatically extract these dimensions from documents and enrich the dataset description with them. Our approach could aid data publishers and practitioners in creating machine-readable documentation to improve the discoverability of their datasets, assess their compliance with current AI regulations, and improve the overall quality of ML models trained on them. In this paper, we evaluate the approach on 12 scientific dataset papers published in two scientific journals (Nature's Scientific Data and Elsevier's Data in Brief) using two different LLMs (GPT3.5 and Flan-UL2). Results show good accuracy with our prompt extraction strategies. Concrete results vary depending on the dimensions, but overall, GPT3.5 shows slightly better accuracy (81,21%) than FLAN-UL2 (69,13%) although it is more prone to hallucinations. We have released an open-source tool implementing our approach and a replication package, including the experiments' code and results, in an open-source repository.</p></details> |  |

Outsourcing such medical image processing tasks to hybrid clouds has benefits, such as a significant reduction of execution time and monetary cost. However, due to privacy concerns, it is still challenging to process sensitive medical images over clouds, which would hinder their deployment in many real-world applications. To overcome this, we first formulate the overall optimization objectives of the privacy-preserving distributed system model, i.e., minimizing the amount of information about the private data learned by the adversaries throughout the process, reducing the maximum execution time and cost under the user budget constraint. We propose a novel privacy-preserving and cost-effective method called PriCE to solve this multi-objective optimization problem. We performed extensive simulation experiments for artifact detection tasks on medical images using an ensemble of five deep convolutional neural network inferences as the workflow task. Experimental results show that PriCE successfully splits a wide range of input gigapixel medical images with graph-coloring-based strategies, yielding desired output utility and lowering the privacy risk, makespan, and monetary cost under user's budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted at Europar 2024</p></details> |

Each artifact and its parts are represented as textual nodes stored in a Knowledge Graph (KG). To address the limitations of traditional scholarly KG construction and utilization methods, which often fail to capture fine-grained details, we propose a novel framework that integrates the Deep Document Model (DDM) for comprehensive document representation and the KG-enhanced Query Processing (KGQP) for optimized complex query handling. DDM enables a fine-grained representation of the hierarchical structure and semantic relationships within academic papers, while KGQP leverages the KG structure to improve query accuracy and efficiency with LLMs. By combining the ASKG with LLMs, our approach enhances knowledge utilization and natural language understanding capabilities. The proposed system employs an automatic LLM-SPARQL fusion to retrieve relevant facts and textual nodes from the ASKG. Initial experiments demonstrate that our framework is superior to baseline methods in terms of accuracy retrieval and query efficiency. We showcase the practical application of our framework in academic research scenarios, highlighting its potential to revolutionize scholarly knowledge management and discovery. This work empowers researchers to acquire and utilize knowledge from documents more effectively and provides a foundation for developing precise and reliable interactions with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>for t...</summary><p>for the associated repository, see http://w3id.org/kgcp/KGQP</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models can Deliver Accurate and Interpretable Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15370v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) plays a crucial role in various industries by identifying atypical patterns that deviate from standard trends, thereby maintaining system integrity and enabling prompt response measures. Traditional TSAD models, which often rely on deep learning, require extensive training data and operate as black boxes, lacking interpretability for detected anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose LLMAD, a novel TSAD method that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) to deliver accurate and interpretable TSAD results. LLMAD innovatively applies LLMs for in-context anomaly detection by retrieving both positive and negative similar time series segments, significantly enhancing LLMs' effectiveness. Furthermore, LLMAD employs the Anomaly Detection Chain-of-Thought (AnoCoT) approach to mimic expert logic for its decision-making process. This method further enhances its performance and enables LLMAD to provide explanations for their detections through versatile perspectives, which are particularly important for user decision-making. Experiments on three datasets indicate that our LLMAD achieves detection performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep learning methods while offering remarkable interpretability for detections. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that directly employs LLMs for TSAD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alleviating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models through Hallucination-Induced Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15356v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Visual Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated exceptional abilities in understanding multimodal data, they invariably suffer from hallucinations, leading to a disconnect between the generated text and the corresponding images. Almost all current visual contrastive decoding methods attempt to mitigate these hallucinations by introducing visual uncertainty information that appropriately widens the contrastive logits gap between hallucinatory and targeted ones. However, due to uncontrollable nature of the global visual uncertainty, they struggle to precisely induce the hallucinatory tokens, which severely limits their effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and may even lead to the generation of undesired hallucinations. To tackle this issue, we conducted the theoretical analysis to promote the effectiveness of contrast decoding. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel optimization strategy named Hallucination-Induced Optimization (HIO). This strategy seeks to amplify the contrast between hallucinatory and targeted tokens relying on a fine-tuned theoretical preference model (i.e., Contrary Bradley-Terry Model), thereby facilitating efficient contrast decoding to alleviate hallucinations in LVLMs. Extensive experimental research demonstrates that our HIO strategy can effectively reduce hallucinations in LVLMs, outperforming state-of-the-art methods across various benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2311.16922 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[UnKE: Unstructured Knowledge Editing in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15349v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent knowledge editing methods have primarily focused on modifying structured knowledge in large language models, heavily relying on the assumption that structured knowledge is stored as key-value pairs locally in MLP layers or specific neurons. However, this task setting overlooks the fact that a significant portion of real-world knowledge is stored in an unstructured format, characterized by long-form content, noise, and a complex yet comprehensive nature. The "knowledge locating" and "term-driven optimization" techniques conducted from the assumption used in previous methods (e.g., MEMIT) are ill-suited for unstructured knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unstructured knowledge editing method, namely UnKE, which extends previous assumptions in the layer dimension and token dimension. Firstly, in the layer dimension, we discard the "knowledge locating" step and treat first few layers as the key, which expand knowledge storage through layers to break the "knowledge stored locally" assumption. Next, we replace "term-driven optimization" with "cause-driven optimization" across all inputted tokens in the token dimension, directly optimizing the last layer of the key generator to perform editing to generate the required key vectors. By utilizing key-value pairs at the layer level, UnKE effectively represents and edits complex and comprehensive unstructured knowledge, leveraging the potential of both the MLP and attention layers. Results on newly proposed unstructure knowledge editing dataset (UnKEBench) and traditional structured datasets demonstrate that UnKE achieves remarkable performance, surpassing strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiSup: Bidirectional Quantization Error Suppression for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15346v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the size and context length of Large Language Models (LLMs) grow, weight-activation quantization has emerged as a crucial technique for efficient deployment of LLMs. Compared to weight-only quantization, weight-activation quantization presents greater challenges due to the presence of outliers in activations. Existing methods have made significant progress by exploring mixed-precision quantization and outlier suppression. However, these methods primarily focus on optimizing the results of single matrix multiplication, neglecting the bidirectional propagation of quantization errors in LLMs. Specifically, errors accumulate vertically within the same token through layers, and diffuse horizontally across different tokens due to self-attention mechanisms. To address this issue, we introduce BiSup, a Bidirectional quantization error Suppression method. By constructing appropriate optimizable parameter spaces, BiSup utilizes a small amount of data for quantization-aware parameter-efficient fine-tuning to suppress the error vertical accumulation. Besides, BiSup employs prompt mixed-precision quantization strategy, which preserves high precision for the key-value cache of system prompts, to mitigate the error horizontal diffusion. Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen families demonstrate that BiSup can improve performance over two state-of-the-art methods (the average WikiText2 perplexity decreases from 13.26 to 9.41 for Atom and from 14.33 to 7.85 for QuaRot under the W3A3-g128 configuration), further facilitating the practical applications of low-bit weight-activation quantization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessing Political Bias in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13041v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assessment of bias within Large Language Models (LLMs) has emerged as a critical concern in the contemporary discourse surrounding Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of their potential impact on societal dynamics. Especially, recognizing and considering political bias within LLM applications is central when closing in on the tipping point toward performative prediction. Then, being educated about potential effects and the societal behavior LLMs can drive at scale due to their interplay with human operators. In this way, the upcoming elections of the European Parliament will not remain unaffected by LLMs. We evaluate the political bias of the currently most popular open-source LLMs (instruct or assistant models) concerning political issues within the European Union (EU) from a German voter's perspective. To do so, we use the "Wahl-O-Mat", a voting advice application used in Germany. From the voting advice of the "Wahl-O-Mat" we quantize the degree of alignment of LLMs with German political parties. We show that larger models, such as Llama3-70B, tend to align more closely with left-leaning political parties, while smaller models often remain neutral, particularly when prompted in English. The central finding is, that LLMs are similarly biased, with low variances in the alignment with respect to a specific party. Our findings underline the importance of rigorously assessing and making bias transparent in LLMs to safeguard the integrity and trustworthiness of applications that employ the capabilities of performative prediction and the invisible hand of machine learning prediction and language generation.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[How do Large Language Models Handle Multilingualism?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18815v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across diverse languages. This study explores how LLMs handle multilingualism. Based on observed language ratio shifts among layers and the relationships between network structures and certain capabilities, we hypothesize the LLM's multilingual workflow ($\texttt{MWork}$): LLMs initially understand the query, converting multilingual inputs into English for task-solving. In the intermediate layers, they employ English for thinking and incorporate multilingual knowledge with self-attention and feed-forward structures, respectively. In the final layers, LLMs generate responses aligned with the original language of the query. To verify $\texttt{MWork}$, we introduce Parallel Language-specific Neuron Detection ($\texttt{PLND}$) to identify activated neurons for inputs in different languages without any labeled data. Using $\texttt{PLND}$, we validate $\texttt{MWork}$ through extensive experiments involving the deactivation of language-specific neurons across various layers and structures. Moreover, $\texttt{MWork}$ allows fine-tuning of language-specific neurons with a small dataset, enhancing multilingual abilities in a specific language without compromising others. This approach results in an average improvement of $3.6\%$ for high-resource languages and $2.3\%$ for low-resource languages across all tasks with just $400$ documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comprehensive Survey of Accelerated Generation Techniques in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13019v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the crucial importance of accelerating text generation in large language models (LLMs) for efficiently producing content, the sequential nature of this process often leads to high inference latency, posing challenges for real-time applications. Various techniques have been proposed and developed to address these challenges and improve efficiency. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of accelerated generation techniques in autoregressive language models, aiming to understand the state-of-the-art methods and their applications. We categorize these techniques into several key areas: speculative decoding, early exiting mechanisms, and non-autoregressive methods. We discuss each category's underlying principles, advantages, limitations, and recent advancements. Through this survey, we aim to offer insights into the current landscape of techniques in LLMs and provide guidance for future research directions in this critical area of natural language processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Re-Organization Improves Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13985v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) has attracted considerable interest. Recent approaches primarily focus on improving the reasoning process to yield a more precise final answer. However, in scenarios involving contextually aware reasoning, these methods neglect the importance of first identifying logical relationships from the context before proceeding with the reasoning. This oversight could lead to a superficial understanding and interaction with the context, potentially undermining the quality and reliability of the reasoning outcomes. In this paper, we propose an information re-organization (InfoRE) method before proceeding with the reasoning to enhance the reasoning ability of LLMs. Our re-organization method involves initially extracting logical relationships from the contextual content, such as documents or paragraphs, and subsequently pruning redundant content to minimize noise. Then, we utilize the re-organized information in the reasoning process. This enables LLMs to deeply understand the contextual content by clearly perceiving these logical relationships, while also ensuring high-quality responses by eliminating potential noise. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in improving the reasoning ability, we conduct experiments using Llama2-70B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 on various contextually aware multi-hop reasoning tasks. Using only a zero-shot setting, our method achieves an average absolute improvement of 4% across all tasks, highlighting its potential to improve the reasoning performance of LLMs. Our source code is available at https://github.com/hustcxx/InfoRE.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we introduce and open-source our math reasoning LLMs InternLM-Math which is continue pre-trained from InternLM2. We unify chain-of-thought reasoning, reward modeling, formal reasoning, data augmentation, and code interpreter in a unified seq2seq format and supervise our model to be a versatile math reasoner, verifier, prover, and augmenter. These abilities can be used to develop the next math LLMs or self-iteration. InternLM-Math obtains open-sourced state-of-the-art performance under the setting of in-context learning, supervised fine-tuning, and code-assisted reasoning in various informal and formal benchmarks including GSM8K, MATH, Hungary math exam, MathBench-ZH, and MiniF2F. Our pre-trained model achieves 30.3 on the MiniF2F test set without fine-tuning. We further explore how to use LEAN to solve math problems and study its performance under the setting of multi-task learning which shows the possibility of using LEAN as a unified platform for solving and proving in math.

| **[Enhancing Q-Learning with Large Language Model Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03341v3)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Q-learning excels in learning from feedback within sequential decision-making tasks but often requires extensive sampling to achieve significant improvements. While reward shaping can enhance learning efficiency, non-potential-based methods introduce biases that affect performance, and potential-based reward shaping, though unbiased, lacks the ability to provide heuristics for state-action pairs, limiting its effectiveness in complex environments. Large language models (LLMs) can achieve zero-shot learning for simpler tasks, but they suffer from low inference speeds and occasional hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LLM-guided Q-learning}, a framework that leverages LLMs as heuristics to aid in learning the Q-function for reinforcement learning. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach adapts to hallucinations, improves sample efficiency, and avoids biasing final performance. Experimental results show that our algorithm is general, robust, and capable of preventing ineffective exploration.</p></details> | Note:Arxiv,Draft |
| **[ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05821v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank factorization, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the outlier phenomenon in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by scaling the weight matrix based on the activation distribution, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. ASVD can compress a network by 10-20%, without compromising the performance of LLMs. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. Thanks to the 50-75% reduction in the rank of the KV projection matrices, ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Contamination Quiz: A Tool to Detect and Estimate Contamination in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06233v6)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Data Contamination Quiz (DCQ), a simple and effective approach to detect data contamination in large language models (LLMs) and estimate the amount of it. Specifically, we frame data contamination detection as a series of multiple-choice questions and devise a quiz format wherein three perturbed versions of each subsampled instance from a specific dataset partition (e.g., GSM8k test set) are created. These changes only include word-level perturbations. The generated perturbations, along with the original dataset instance, form the options in the DCQ, with an extra option accommodating the possibility of selecting none of the provided options. Given that the only distinguishing signal among the options is the exact wording with respect to the original dataset instance, an LLM, when tasked with identifying the original dataset instance, gravitates towards selecting the original one if it has been exposed to it in its pre-training phase -- a trait intrinsic to LLMs. While accounting for positional biases in LLMs, the quiz performance reveals the contamination level for the model being examined with the dataset partition to which the quiz pertains. Applied to various datasets with GPT-4 and GPT-3.5, our findings -- while fully lacking access to pre-training data and model parameters -- suggest that DCQ achieves state-of-the-art results and uncovers greater contamination/memorization levels compared to existing methods and proficiently bypasses more safety filters, especially those set to avoid generating copyrighted contents.</p></details> | v3 preprint |
| **[TrojanRAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation Can Be Backdoor Driver in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13401v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have raised concerns about potential security threats despite performing significantly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Backdoor attacks initially verified that LLM is doing substantial harm at all stages, but the cost and robustness have been criticized. Attacking LLMs is inherently risky in security review, while prohibitively expensive. Besides, the continuous iteration of LLMs will degrade the robustness of backdoors. In this paper, we propose TrojanRAG, which employs a joint backdoor attack in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation, thereby manipulating LLMs in universal attack scenarios. Specifically, the adversary constructs elaborate target contexts and trigger sets. Multiple pairs of backdoor shortcuts are orthogonally optimized by contrastive learning, thus constraining the triggering conditions to a parameter subspace to improve the matching. To improve the recall of the RAG for the target contexts, we introduce a knowledge graph to construct structured data to achieve hard matching at a fine-grained level. Moreover, we normalize the backdoor scenarios in LLMs to analyze the real harm caused by backdoors from both attackers' and users' perspectives and further verify whether the context is a favorable tool for jailbreaking models. Extensive experimental results on truthfulness, language understanding, and harmfulness show that TrojanRAG exhibits versatility threats while maintaining retrieval capabilities on normal queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[DEEM: Diffusion Models Serve as the Eyes of Large Language Models for Image Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15232v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced the emergence of large multimodal models (LMMs). While LMMs have achieved tremendous success by promoting the synergy between multimodal comprehension and creation, they often face challenges when confronted with out-of-distribution data. This is primarily due to their reliance on image encoders trained to encode images into task-relevant features, which may lead them to disregard irrelevant details. Delving into the modeling capabilities of diffusion models for images naturally prompts the question: Can diffusion models serve as the eyes of large language models for image perception? In this paper, we propose DEEM, a simple and effective approach that utilizes the generative feedback of diffusion models to align the semantic distributions of the image encoder. This addresses the drawbacks of previous methods that solely relied on image encoders like ViT, thereby enhancing the model's resilience against out-of-distribution samples and reducing visual hallucinations. Importantly, this is achieved without requiring additional training modules and with fewer training parameters. We extensively evaluated DEEM on both our newly constructed RobustVQA benchmark and another well-known benchmark, POPE, for object hallucination. Compared to the state-of-the-art interleaved content generation models, DEEM exhibits enhanced robustness and a superior capacity to alleviate model hallucinations while utilizing fewer trainable parameters, less pre-training data (10%), and a smaller base model size.</p></details> | 25 pages |

In response, we present ConfusionPrompt, a novel private LLM inference framework designed to obfuscate the server by: (i) decomposing the prompt into sub-prompts, and (ii) generating pseudo prompts along with the genuine sub-prompts as input to the online LLM. Eventually, the returned responses can be recomposed by the user to obtain the final whole response. Such designs endows our framework with advantages over previous protocols that (i) it can be seamlessly integrated with existing black-box LLMs, and (ii) it achieves significantly better privacy-utility trade-off than existing text perturbation-based methods. We develop a $(\lambda, \mu, \rho)$-privacy model to formulate the requirement for a privacy-preserving group of prompts, and provide a complexity analysis, affirming ConfusionPrompt's efficiency. Our empirical evaluation reveals that our method offers significantly higher utility compared to local inference methods using open-source models and perturbation-based techniques, while also requiring much less memory than open-source LLMs.</p></details> | 21 pages |

In this study, we introduce a pluggable CTG framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) named Dynamic Attribute Graphs-based controlled text generation (DATG). This framework utilizes an attribute scorer to evaluate the attributes of sentences generated by LLMs and constructs dynamic attribute graphs. DATG modulates the occurrence of key attribute words and key anti-attribute words, achieving effective attribute control without compromising the original capabilities of the model. We conduct experiments across four datasets in two tasks: toxicity mitigation and sentiment transformation, employing five LLMs as foundational models. Our findings highlight a remarkable enhancement in control accuracy, achieving a peak improvement of 19.29% over baseline methods in the most favorable task across four datasets. Additionally, we observe a significant decrease in perplexity, markedly improving text fluency.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, Accepted by ACL 2024 Findings</p></details> |
| **[A Simple Solution for Homomorphic Evaluation on Large Intervals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15201v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homomorphic encryption (HE) is a promising technique used for privacy-preserving computation. Since HE schemes only support primitive polynomial operations, homomorphic evaluation of polynomial approximations for non-polynomial functions plays an important role in privacy-preserving machine learning. In this paper, we introduce a simple solution to approximating any functions, which might be overmissed by researchers: just using the neural networks for regressions. By searching decent superparameters, neural networks can achieve near-optimal computation depth for a given function with fixed precision, thereby reducing the modulus consumed. There are three main reasons why we choose neural networks for homomorphic evaluation of polynomial approximations. Firstly, neural networks with polynomial activation functions can be used to approximate whatever functions are needed in an encrypted state. This means that we can compute by one unified process for any polynomial approximation, such as that of Sigmoid or of ReLU. Secondly, by carefully finding an appropriate architecture, neural networks can efficiently evaluate a polynomial using near-optimal multiplicative depth, which would consume less modulus and therefore employ less ciphertext refreshing. Finally, as popular tools, model neural networks have many well-studied techniques that can conveniently serve our solution. Experiments showed that our method can be used for approximation of various functions. We exploit our method to the evaluation of the Sigmoid function on large intervals $[-30, +30]$, $[-50, +50]$, and $[-70, +70]$, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meta-meshing and triangulating lattice structures at a large scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15197v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lattice structures have been widely used in applications due to their superior mechanical properties. To fabricate such structures, a geometric processing step called triangulation is often employed to transform them into the STL format before sending them to 3D printers. Because lattice structures tend to have high geometric complexity, this step usually generates a large amount of triangles, a memory and compute-intensive task. This problem manifests itself clearly through large-scale lattice structures that have millions or billions of struts. To address this problem, this paper proposes to transform a lattice structure into an intermediate model called meta-mesh before undergoing real triangulation. Compared to triangular meshes, meta-meshes are very lightweight and much less compute-demanding. The meta-mesh can also work as a base mesh reusable for conveniently and efficiently triangulating lattice structures with arbitrary resolutions. A CPU+GPU asynchronous meta-meshing pipeline has been developed to efficiently generate meta-meshes from lattice structures. It shifts from the thread-centric GPU algorithm design paradigm commonly used in CAD to the recent warp-centric design paradigm to achieve high performance. This is achieved by a new data compression method, a GPU cache-aware data structure, and a workload-balanced scheduling method that can significantly reduce memory divergence and branch divergence. Experimenting with various billion-scale lattice structures, the proposed method is seen to be two orders of magnitude faster than previously achievable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Large Language Model-based Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15194v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) suffers from sample inefficiency in sparse reward domains, and the problem is pronounced if there are stochastic transitions. To improve the sample efficiency, reward shaping is a well-studied approach to introduce intrinsic rewards that can help the RL agent converge to an optimal policy faster. However, designing a useful reward shaping function specific to each problem is challenging, even for domain experts. They would either have to rely on task-specific domain knowledge or provide an expert demonstration independently for each task. Given, that Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly gained prominence across a magnitude of natural language tasks, we aim to answer the following question: Can we leverage LLMs to construct a reward shaping function that can boost the sample efficiency of an RL agent? In this work, we aim to leverage off-the-shelf LLMs to generate a guide policy by solving a simpler deterministic abstraction of the original problem that can then be used to construct the reward shaping function for the downstream RL agent. Given the ineffectiveness of directly prompting LLMs, we propose MEDIC: a framework that augments LLMs with a Model-based feEDback critIC, which verifies LLM-generated outputs, to generate a possibly sub-optimal but valid plan for the abstract problem. Our experiments across domains from the BabyAI environment suite show 1) the effectiveness of augmenting LLMs with MEDIC, 2) a significant improvement in the sample complexity of PPO and A2C-based RL agents when guided by our LLM-generated plan, and finally, 3) pave the direction for further explorations of how these models can be used to augment existing RL pipelines.</p></details> | 9 pages + Appendix |
| **[CuckooGraph: A Scalable and Space-Time Efficient Data Structure for Large-Scale Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15193v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs play an increasingly important role in various big data applications. However, existing graph data structures cannot simultaneously address the performance bottlenecks caused by the dynamic updates, large scale, and high query complexity of current graphs. This paper proposes a novel data structure for large-scale dynamic graphs called CuckooGraph. It does not need to know the amount of graph data in advance, and can adaptively resize to the most memory-efficient form according to the data scale, realizing multiple graph analytic tasks faster. The key techniques of CuckooGraph include TRANSFORMATION and DENYLIST. TRANSFORMATION fully utilizes the limited memory by designing related data structures that allow flexible space transformations to smoothly expand/tighten the required space depending on the number of incoming items. DENYLIST efficiently handles item insertion failures and further improves processing speed. We conduct extensive experiments, and the results show that CuckooGraph significantly reduces query time by four orders of magnitude on 1-hop successor and precursor queries compared to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Evaluation of Estimative Uncertainty in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15185v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Words of estimative probability (WEPs), such as ''maybe'' or ''probably not'' are ubiquitous in natural language for communicating estimative uncertainty, compared with direct statements involving numerical probability. Human estimative uncertainty, and its calibration with numerical estimates, has long been an area of study -- including by intelligence agencies like the CIA. This study compares estimative uncertainty in commonly used large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and ERNIE-4 to that of humans, and to each other. Here we show that LLMs like GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 align with human estimates for some, but not all, WEPs presented in English. Divergence is also observed when the LLM is presented with gendered roles and Chinese contexts. Further study shows that an advanced LLM like GPT-4 can consistently map between statistical and estimative uncertainty, but a significant performance gap remains. The results contribute to a growing body of research on human-LLM alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoGS: Large Scale Road Surface Reconstruction based on 2D Gaussian Splatting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14342v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road surface reconstruction plays a crucial role in autonomous driving, which can be used for road lane perception and autolabeling tasks. Recently, mesh-based road surface reconstruction algorithms show promising reconstruction results. However, these mesh-based methods suffer from slow speed and poor rendering quality. In contrast, the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) shows superior rendering speed and quality. Although 3DGS employs explicit Gaussian spheres to represent the scene, it lacks the ability to directly represent the geometric information of the scene. To address this limitation, we propose a novel large-scale road surface reconstruction approach based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS), named RoGS. The geometric shape of the road is explicitly represented using 2D Gaussian surfels, where each surfel stores color, semantics, and geometric information. Compared to Gaussian spheres, the Gaussian surfels aligns more closely with the physical reality of the road. Distinct from previous initialization methods that rely on point clouds for Gaussian spheres, we introduce a trajectory-based initialization for Gaussian surfels. Thanks to the explicit representation of the Gaussian surfels and a good initialization, our method achieves a significant acceleration while improving reconstruction quality. We achieve excellent results in reconstruction of roads surfaces in a variety of challenging real-world scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[UHGEval: Benchmarking the Hallucination of Chinese Large Language Models via Unconstrained Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15296v3)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as pivotal contributors in contemporary natural language processing and are increasingly being applied across a diverse range of industries. However, these large-scale probabilistic statistical models cannot currently ensure the requisite quality in professional content generation. These models often produce hallucinated text, compromising their practical utility in professional contexts. To assess the authentic reliability of LLMs in text generation, numerous initiatives have developed benchmark evaluations for hallucination phenomena. Nevertheless, these benchmarks frequently utilize constrained generation techniques due to cost and temporal constraints. These techniques encompass the use of directed hallucination induction and strategies that deliberately alter authentic text to produce hallucinations. These approaches are not congruent with the unrestricted text generation demanded by real-world applications. Furthermore, a well-established Chinese-language dataset dedicated to the evaluation of hallucinations in text generation is presently lacking. Consequently, we have developed an Unconstrained Hallucination Generation Evaluation (UHGEval) benchmark, designed to compile outputs produced with minimal restrictions by LLMs. Concurrently, we have established a comprehensive benchmark evaluation framework to aid subsequent researchers in undertaking scalable and reproducible experiments. We have also executed extensive experiments, evaluating prominent Chinese language models and the GPT series models to derive professional performance insights regarding hallucination challenges.</p></details> | Accepted by ACL 2024 |

However, such a collection manner poses a privacy threat, and one potential solution is Federated Learning (FL), which transfers gradients, not raw data, among clients. Unlike traditional networks, FL for LLMs incurs significant communication costs due to their tremendous parameters. This study introduces an innovative approach to compress gradients to improve communication efficiency during LLM FL, formulating the new FL pipeline named CG-FedLLM. This approach integrates an encoder on the client side to acquire the compressed gradient features and a decoder on the server side to reconstruct the gradients. We also developed a novel training strategy that comprises Temporal-ensemble Gradient-Aware Pre-training (TGAP) to identify characteristic gradients of the target model and Federated AutoEncoder-Involved Fine-tuning (FAF) to compress gradients adaptively. Extensive experiments confirm that our approach reduces communication costs and improves performance (e.g., average 3 points increment compared with traditional CL- and FL-based fine-tuning with LlaMA on a well-recognized benchmark, C-Eval). This improvement is because our encoder-decoder, trained via TGAP and FAF, can filter gradients while selectively preserving critical features. Furthermore, we present a series of experimental analyses focusing on the signal-to-noise ratio, compression rate, and robustness within this privacy-centric framework, providing insight into developing more efficient and secure LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In ABM, agents (e.g., households, firms) interact within a macroeconomic environment, collectively generating market dynamics. Existing agent modeling typically employs predetermined rules or learning-based neural networks for decision-making. However, customizing each agent presents significant challenges, complicating the modeling of agent heterogeneity. Additionally, the influence of multi-period market dynamics and multifaceted macroeconomic factors are often overlooked in decision-making processes. In this work, we introduce EconAgent, a large language model-empowered agent with human-like characteristics for macroeconomic simulation. We first construct a simulation environment that incorporates various market dynamics driven by agents' decisions regarding work and consumption. Through the perception module, we create heterogeneous agents with distinct decision-making mechanisms. Furthermore, we model the impact of macroeconomic trends using a memory module, which allows agents to reflect on past individual experiences and market dynamics. Simulation experiments show that EconAgent can make realistic decisions, leading to more reasonable macroeconomic phenomena compared to existing rule-based or learning-based agents. Our codes are released at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/ACL24-EconAgent.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 (main conference)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a methodology to align LLMs, such as Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models, with ethical, privacy, and safety standards by leveraging the gradient ascent algorithm for knowledge unlearning. Our approach aims to selectively erase or modify learned information in LLMs, targeting harmful responses and copyrighted content. This paper presents a dual-pronged approach to enhance the ethical and safe behavior of large language models (LLMs) by addressing the issues of harmful responses and copyrighted content. To mitigate harmful responses, we applied gradient ascent on the PKU dataset, achieving a 75\% reduction in harmful responses for Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models (OPT1.3b and OPT2.7b) \citet{zhang2022opt} while retaining previous knowledge using the TruthfulQA dataset \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2109-07958}. For handling copyrighted content, we constructed a custom dataset based on the Lord of the Rings corpus and aligned LLMs (OPT1.3b and OPT2.7b) \citet{zhang2022opt} through LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models \citet{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2106-09685} finetuning. Subsequently, we employed gradient ascent to unlearn the Lord of the Rings content, resulting in a remarkable reduction in the presence of copyrighted material. To maintain a diverse knowledge base, we utilized the Book Corpus dataset. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation technique for assessing the effectiveness of harmful unlearning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Typically, cultural datasets and benchmarks are constructed either by extracting subsets of existing datasets or by aggregating from platforms such as Wikipedia and social media. However, these approaches are highly dependent on real-world data and human annotations, making them costly and difficult to scale. Inspired by cognitive theories on social communication, this paper introduces CulturePark, an LLM-powered multi-agent communication framework for cultural data collection. CulturePark simulates cross-cultural human communication with LLM-based agents playing roles in different cultures. It generates high-quality cross-cultural dialogues encapsulating human beliefs, norms, and customs. Using CulturePark, we generated 41,000 cultural samples to fine-tune eight culture-specific LLMs. We evaluated these models across three downstream tasks: content moderation, cultural alignment, and cultural education. Results show that for content moderation, our GPT-3.5-based models either match or outperform GPT-4 on datasets. Regarding cultural alignment, our models surpass GPT-4 on Hofstede's VSM 13 framework. Furthermore, for cultural education of human participants, our models demonstrate superior outcomes in both learning efficacy and user experience compared to GPT-4. CulturePark proves an important step in addressing cultural bias and advancing the democratization of AI, highlighting the critical role of culturally inclusive data in model training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report; 28 pages</p></details> |

Different LLMs achieve different performance at different costs. A challenge for users lies in choosing the LLMs that best fit their needs, balancing cost and performance. In this paper, we propose a framework for addressing the cost-effective query allocation problem for LLMs. Given a set of input queries and candidate LLMs, our framework, named OptLLM, provides users with a range of optimal solutions to choose from, aligning with their budget constraints and performance preferences, including options for maximizing accuracy and minimizing cost. OptLLM predicts the performance of candidate LLMs on each query using a multi-label classification model with uncertainty estimation and then iteratively generates a set of non-dominated solutions by destructing and reconstructing the current solution. To evaluate the effectiveness of OptLLM, we conduct extensive experiments on various types of tasks, including text classification, question answering, sentiment analysis, reasoning, and log parsing. Our experimental results demonstrate that OptLLM substantially reduces costs by 2.40% to 49.18% while achieving the same accuracy as the best LLM. Compared to other multi-objective optimization algorithms, OptLLM improves accuracy by 2.94% to 69.05% at the same cost or saves costs by 8.79% and 95.87% while maintaining the highest attainable accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICWS 2024</p></details> |

Large Language Models (LLMs), in turn, have shown great potential and high performance in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, but their application for normalization remains understudied. Methods: We applied both proprietary and open-source LLMs in combination with several rule-based normalization systems commonly used in biomedical research. We used a two-step LLM integration approach, (1) using an LLM to generate alternative phrasings of a source utterance, and (2) to prune candidate UMLS concepts, using a variety of prompting methods. We measure results by $F_{\beta}$, where we favor recall over precision, and F1. Results: We evaluated a total of 5,523 concept terms and text contexts from a publicly available dataset of human-annotated biomedical abstracts. Incorporating GPT-3.5-turbo increased overall $F_{\beta}$ and F1 in normalization systems +9.5 and +7.3 (MetaMapLite), +13.9 and +10.9 (QuickUMLS), and +10.5 and +10.3 (BM25), while the open-source Vicuna model achieved +10.8 and +12.2 (MetaMapLite), +14.7 and +15 (QuickUMLS), and +15.6 and +18.7 (BM25). Conclusions: Existing general-purpose LLMs, both propriety and open-source, can be leveraged at scale to greatly improve normalization performance using existing tools, with no fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Despite improved performance, existing methods (including the state-of-the-art, Min-K%) are mostly developed upon simple heuristics and lack solid, reasonable foundations. In this work, we propose a novel and theoretically motivated methodology for pre-training data detection, named Min-K%++. Specifically, we present a key insight that training samples tend to be local maxima of the modeled distribution along each input dimension through maximum likelihood training, which in turn allow us to insightfully translate the problem into identification of local maxima. Then, we design our method accordingly that works under the discrete distribution modeled by LLMs, whose core idea is to determine whether the input forms a mode or has relatively high probability under the conditional categorical distribution. Empirically, the proposed method achieves new SOTA performance across multiple settings. On the WikiMIA benchmark, Min-K%++ outperforms the runner-up by 6.2% to 10.5% in detection AUROC averaged over five models. On the more challenging MIMIR benchmark, it consistently improves upon reference-free methods while performing on par with reference-based method that requires an extra reference model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page and code is available at https://zjysteven.github.io/mink-plus-plus/</p></details> |

However, current methods only apply to rather simple reports, like multiple-choice or scalar numbers. We aim to broaden these techniques to the larger domain of text-based reports, drawing on the recent developments in large language models. This vastly increases the applicability of peer prediction mechanisms as textual feedback is the norm in a large variety of feedback channels: peer reviews, e-commerce customer reviews, and comments on social media. We introduce two mechanisms, the Generative Peer Prediction Mechanism (GPPM) and the Generative Synopsis Peer Prediction Mechanism (GSPPM). These mechanisms utilize LLMs as predictors, mapping from one agent's report to a prediction of her peer's report. Theoretically, we show that when the LLM prediction is sufficiently accurate, our mechanisms can incentivize high effort and truth-telling as an (approximate) Bayesian Nash equilibrium. Empirically, we confirm the efficacy of our mechanisms through experiments conducted on two real datasets: the Yelp review dataset and the ICLR OpenReview dataset. We highlight the results that on the ICLR dataset, our mechanisms can differentiate three quality levels -- human-written reviews, GPT-4-generated reviews, and GPT-3.5-generated reviews in terms of expected scores. Additionally, GSPPM penalizes LLM-generated reviews more effectively than GPPM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Twenty-Fifth ACM Conference on Economics and Computation (EC'24)</p></details> |

We reverse engineer an adapter which isolates what an instruction-tuned model has learned beyond its corresponding pretrained base model. Importantly, this requires no additional data or training. We can then fine-tune the base model on a new domain and readapt it to instruction following with the reverse engineered adapter. RE-Adapt and our low-rank variant LoRE-Adapt both outperform other methods of fine-tuning, across multiple popular LLMs and datasets, even when the models are used in conjunction with retrieval-augmented generation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing 3D assets and generative models often lack authentic material properties. Manual assignment of materials using graphic software is a tedious and time-consuming task. In this paper, we exploit advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly GPT-4V, to present a novel approach, Make-it-Real: 1) We demonstrate that GPT-4V can effectively recognize and describe materials, allowing the construction of a detailed material library. 2) Utilizing a combination of visual cues and hierarchical text prompts, GPT-4V precisely identifies and aligns materials with the corresponding components of 3D objects. 3) The correctly matched materials are then meticulously applied as reference for the new SVBRDF material generation according to the original albedo map, significantly enhancing their visual authenticity. Make-it-Real offers a streamlined integration into the 3D content creation workflow, showcasing its utility as an essential tool for developers of 3D assets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sunzey.github.io/Make-it-Real/</p></details> |

The AstroPT models presented here have been pretrained on 8.6 million $512 \times 512$ pixel $grz$-band galaxy postage stamp observations from the DESI Legacy Survey DR8. We train a selection of foundation models of increasing size from 1 million to 2.1 billion parameters, and find that AstroPT follows a similar saturating log-log scaling law to textual models. We also find that the models' performances on downstream tasks as measured by linear probing improves with model size up to the model parameter saturation point. We believe that collaborative community development paves the best route towards realising an open source `Large Observation Model' -- a model trained on data taken from the observational sciences at the scale seen in natural language processing. To this end, we release the source code, weights, and dataset for AstroPT under the MIT license, and invite potential collaborators to join us in collectively building and researching these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 1 table.

For example, ``If a \textit{doctor} were a \textit{color}, what color would it be?''. This seemingly peculiar task is designed to investigate how people represent concrete and abstract concepts through their mappings between categories and their reasoning processes over those mappings. In this paper, we adapt this task from cognitive science to evaluate the conceptualization and reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) through a behavioral study. We examine several LLMs by prompting them with a cross-domain mapping task and analyzing their responses at both the population and individual levels. Additionally, we assess the models' ability to reason about their predictions by analyzing and categorizing their explanations for these mappings. The results reveal several similarities between humans' and models' mappings and explanations, suggesting that models represent concepts similarly to humans. This similarity is evident not only in the model representation but also in their behavior. Furthermore, the models mostly provide valid explanations and deploy reasoning paths that are similar to those of humans.</p></details> | CogSci |

However, it is still unclear if LLMs can adapt their outputs to diverse cultural norms. Our study focuses on this aspect. We introduce NormAd, a novel dataset, which includes 2.6k stories that represent social and cultural norms from 75 countries, to assess the ability of LLMs to adapt to different granular levels of socio-cultural contexts such as the country of origin, its associated cultural values, and prevalent social norms. Our study reveals that LLMs struggle with cultural reasoning across all contextual granularities, showing stronger adaptability to English-centric cultures over those from the Global South. Even with explicit social norms, the top-performing model, Mistral-7b-Instruct, achieves only 81.8\% accuracy, lagging behind the 95.6\% achieved by humans. Evaluation on NormAd further reveals that LLMs struggle to adapt to stories involving gift-giving across cultures. Due to inherent agreement or sycophancy biases, LLMs find it considerably easier to assess the social acceptability of stories that adhere to cultural norms than those that deviate from them. Our benchmark measures the cultural adaptability (or lack thereof) of LLMs, emphasizing the potential to make these technologies more equitable and useful for global audiences. We release the NormAd dataset and its associated code on GitHub.</p></details> | Preprint. In Review |

Despite the impressive accomplishments, large language models (LLMs), even with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), still struggle to efficiently and effectively integrate a large amount of new experiences after pre-training. In this work, we introduce HippoRAG, a novel retrieval framework inspired by the hippocampal indexing theory of human long-term memory to enable deeper and more efficient knowledge integration over new experiences. HippoRAG synergistically orchestrates LLMs, knowledge graphs, and the Personalized PageRank algorithm to mimic the different roles of neocortex and hippocampus in human memory. We compare HippoRAG with existing RAG methods on multi-hop question answering and show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods remarkably, by up to 20%. Single-step retrieval with HippoRAG achieves comparable or better performance than iterative retrieval like IRCoT while being 10-30 times cheaper and 6-13 times faster, and integrating HippoRAG into IRCoT brings further substantial gains. Finally, we show that our method can tackle new types of scenarios that are out of reach of existing methods. Code and data are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/HippoRAG.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complexity and opacity of LLMs, little is known about how these models generate code. We made the first attempt to bridge this knowledge gap by investigating whether LLMs attend to the same parts of a task description as human programmers during code generation. An analysis of six LLMs, including GPT-4, on two popular code generation benchmarks revealed a consistent misalignment between LLMs' and programmers' attention. We manually analyzed 211 incorrect code snippets and found five attention patterns that can be used to explain many code generation errors. Finally, a user study showed that model attention computed by a perturbation-based method is often favored by human programmers. Our findings highlight the need for human-aligned LLMs for better interpretability and programmer trust.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 2024 the ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE '24)</p></details> |

Recently, advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the paradigm in science. Despite the success in other domains, current LLMs often fall short in catering to the needs of domain experts like oceanographers, and the potential of LLMs for ocean science is under-explored. The intrinsic reasons are the immense and intricate nature of ocean data as well as the necessity for higher granularity and richness in knowledge. To alleviate these issues, we introduce OceanGPT, the first-ever large language model in the ocean domain, which is expert in various ocean science tasks. We also propose OceanGPT, a novel framework to automatically obtain a large volume of ocean domain instruction data, which generates instructions based on multi-agent collaboration. Additionally, we construct the first oceanography benchmark, OceanBench, to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in the ocean domain. Though comprehensive experiments, OceanGPT not only shows a higher level of knowledge expertise for oceans science tasks but also gains preliminary embodied intelligence capabilities in ocean technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL20...</summary><p>ACL2024.

| **[Prediction-Powered Ranking of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17826v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are often ranked according to their level of alignment with human preferences -- a model is better than other models if its outputs are more frequently preferred by humans. One of the popular ways to elicit human preferences utilizes pairwise comparisons between the outputs provided by different models to the same inputs. However, since gathering pairwise comparisons by humans is costly and time-consuming, it has become a common practice to gather pairwise comparisons by a strong large language model -- a model strongly aligned with human preferences. Surprisingly, practitioners cannot currently measure the uncertainty that any mismatch between human and model preferences may introduce in the constructed rankings. In this work, we develop a statistical framework to bridge this gap. Given a (small) set of pairwise comparisons by humans and a large set of pairwise comparisons by a model, our framework provides a rank-set -- a set of possible ranking positions -- for each of the models under comparison. Moreover, it guarantees that, with a probability greater than or equal to a user-specified value, the rank-sets cover the true ranking consistent with the distribution of human pairwise preferences asymptotically. Using pairwise comparisons made by humans in the LMSYS Chatbot Arena platform and pairwise comparisons made by three strong large language models, we empirically demonstrate the effectivity of our framework and show that the rank-sets constructed using only pairwise comparisons by the strong large language models are often inconsistent with (the distribution of) human pairwise preferences.</p></details> |  |

Large scale dynamical simulations of the JT model also shed light on the orbital ordering dynamics in colossal magnetoresistance manganites. The JT effect in these materials describes the distortion of local oxygen octahedra driven by a coupling to the orbital degrees of freedom of $e_g$ electrons. An effective electron-mediated interaction between the local JT modes leads to a structural transition and the emergence of long-range orbital order at low temperatures. Assuming the principle of locality, a deep-learning neural-network model is developed to accurately and efficiently predict the electron-induced forces that drive the dynamical evolution of JT phonons. A group-theoretical method is utilized to develop a descriptor that incorporates the combined orbital and lattice symmetry into the ML model. Large-scale Langevin dynamics simulations, enabled by the ML force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening dynamics of the composite JT distortion and orbital order after a thermal quench. The late-stage coarsening of orbital domains exhibits pronounced freezing behaviors which are likely related to the unusual morphology of the domain structures. Our work highlights a promising avenue for multi-scale dynamical modeling of correlated electron systems.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

However, tokenization imposes several disadvantages, such as performance biases, increased adversarial vulnerability, decreased character-level modeling performance, and increased modeling complexity. To address these disadvantages without sacrificing performance, we propose SpaceByte, a novel byte-level decoder architecture that closes the performance gap between byte-level and subword autoregressive language modeling. SpaceByte consists of a byte-level Transformer model, but with extra larger transformer blocks inserted in the middle of the layers. We find that performance is significantly improved by applying these larger blocks only after certain bytes, such as space characters, which typically denote word boundaries. Our experiments show that for a fixed training and inference compute budget, SpaceByte outperforms other byte-level architectures and roughly matches the performance of tokenized Transformer architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>9+10 ...</summary><p>9+10 pages, 3+1 figures, 2+4 tables</p></details> |

Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

In this paper, we introduce FinRobot, a novel open-source AI agent platform supporting multiple financially specialized AI agents, each powered by LLM. Specifically, the platform consists of four major layers: 1) the Financial AI Agents layer that formulates Financial Chain-of-Thought (CoT) by breaking sophisticated financial problems down into logical sequences; 2) the Financial LLM Algorithms layer dynamically configures appropriate model application strategies for specific tasks; 3) the LLMOps and DataOps layer produces accurate models by applying training/fine-tuning techniques and using task-relevant data; 4) the Multi-source LLM Foundation Models layer that integrates various LLMs and enables the above layers to access them directly. Finally, FinRobot provides hands-on for both professional-grade analysts and laypersons to utilize powerful AI techniques for advanced financial analysis.

In this work we present automated evaluations of LLMs for public health tasks involving the classification and extraction of free text. We combine six externally annotated datasets with seven new internally annotated datasets to evaluate LLMs for processing text related to: health burden, epidemiological risk factors, and public health interventions. We initially evaluate five open-weight LLMs (7-70 billion parameters) across all tasks using zero-shot in-context learning. We find that Llama-3-70B-Instruct is the highest performing model, achieving the best results on 15/17 tasks (using micro-F1 scores). We see significant variation across tasks with all open-weight LLMs scoring below 60% micro-F1 on some challenging tasks, such as Contact Classification, while all LLMs achieve greater than 80% micro-F1 on others, such as GI Illness Classification. For a subset of 12 tasks, we also evaluate GPT-4 and find comparable results to Llama-3-70B-Instruct, which scores equally or outperforms GPT-4 on 6 of the 12 tasks. Overall, based on these initial results we find promising signs that LLMs may be useful tools for public health experts to extract information from a wide variety of free text sources, and support public health surveillance, research, and interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages.

| **[Large language models can be zero-shot anomaly detectors for time series?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14755v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown the ability of large language models to perform a variety of tasks, including time series forecasting. The flexible nature of these models allows them to be used for many applications. In this paper, we present a novel study of large language models used for the challenging task of time series anomaly detection. This problem entails two aspects novel for LLMs: the need for the model to identify part of the input sequence (or multiple parts) as anomalous; and the need for it to work with time series data rather than the traditional text input. We introduce sigllm, a framework for time series anomaly detection using large language models. Our framework includes a time-series-to-text conversion module, as well as end-to-end pipelines that prompt language models to perform time series anomaly detection. We investigate two paradigms for testing the abilities of large language models to perform the detection task. First, we present a prompt-based detection method that directly asks a language model to indicate which elements of the input are anomalies. Second, we leverage the forecasting capability of a large language model to guide the anomaly detection process. We evaluated our framework on 11 datasets spanning various sources and 10 pipelines. We show that the forecasting method significantly outperformed the prompting method in all 11 datasets with respect to the F1 score. Moreover, while large language models are capable of finding anomalies, state-of-the-art deep learning models are still superior in performance, achieving results 30% better than large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SliM-LLM: Salience-Driven Mixed-Precision Quantization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14917v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in natural language understanding but require substantial computation and memory resources. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a powerful compression technique extensively investigated in LLMs. However, existing PTQ methods are still not ideal in terms of accuracy and efficiency, especially with below 4 bit-widths. Standard PTQ methods using group-wise quantization suffer difficulties in quantizing LLMs accurately to such low-bit, but advanced methods remaining high-precision weights element-wisely are hard to realize their theoretical hardware efficiency. This paper presents a Salience-Driven Mixed-Precision Quantization scheme for LLMs, namely SliM-LLM. The scheme exploits the salience distribution of weights to determine optimal bit-width and quantizers for accurate LLM quantization, while aligning bit-width partition to groups for compact memory usage and fast integer inference. Specifically, the proposed SliM-LLM mainly relies on two novel techniques: (1) Salience-Determined Bit Allocation utilizes the clustering characteristics of salience distribution to allocate the bit-widths of each group, increasing the accuracy of quantized LLMs and maintaining the inference efficiency; (2) Salience-Weighted Quantizer Calibration optimizes the parameters of the quantizer by considering the element-wise salience within the group, balancing the maintenance of salient information and minimization of errors. Comprehensive experiments show that SliM-LLM significantly improves the accuracy of LLMs at ultra-low bits, e.g., 2-bit LLaMA-7B achieves a 5.5-times memory-saving than original model on NVIDIA A800 GPUs, and 48% decrease of perplexity compared to the state-of-the-art gradient-free PTQ method. Moreover, SliM-LLM+, which is integrated from the extension of SliM-LLM with gradient-based quantizers, further reduces perplexity by 35.1%.</p></details> | 22 pages |

Our method calculates a phylogenetic distance metrics based on the similarity of LLMs' output. The resulting metric is then used to construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture known relationships across a set of 111 open-source and 45 closed models. Furthermore, our phylogenetic distance predicts performance in standard benchmarks, thus demonstrating its functional validity and paving the way for a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. To sum up, by translating population genetic concepts to machine learning, we propose and validate a tool to evaluate LLM development, relationships and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring Implicit Bias in Explicitly Unbiased Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04105v2)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can pass explicit social bias tests but still harbor implicit biases, similar to humans who endorse egalitarian beliefs yet exhibit subtle biases. Measuring such implicit biases can be a challenge: as LLMs become increasingly proprietary, it may not be possible to access their embeddings and apply existing bias measures; furthermore, implicit biases are primarily a concern if they affect the actual decisions that these systems make. We address both challenges by introducing two new measures of bias: LLM Implicit Bias, a prompt-based method for revealing implicit bias; and LLM Decision Bias, a strategy to detect subtle discrimination in decision-making tasks. Both measures are based on psychological research: LLM Implicit Bias adapts the Implicit Association Test, widely used to study the automatic associations between concepts held in human minds; and LLM Decision Bias operationalizes psychological results indicating that relative evaluations between two candidates, not absolute evaluations assessing each independently, are more diagnostic of implicit biases. Using these measures, we found pervasive stereotype biases mirroring those in society in 8 value-aligned models across 4 social categories (race, gender, religion, health) in 21 stereotypes (such as race and criminality, race and weapons, gender and science, age and negativity). Our prompt-based LLM Implicit Bias measure correlates with existing language model embedding-based bias methods, but better predicts downstream behaviors measured by LLM Decision Bias. These new prompt-based measures draw from psychology's long history of research into measuring stereotype biases based on purely observable behavior; they expose nuanced biases in proprietary value-aligned LLMs that appear unbiased according to standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

However, previous studies for jailbreaks usually resort to brute-force optimization or extrapolations of a high computation cost, which might not be practical or effective. In this paper, inspired by the Milgram experiment w.r.t. the authority power for inciting harmfulness, we disclose a lightweight method, termed as DeepInception, which can hypnotize an LLM to be a jailbreaker. Specifically, DeepInception leverages the personification ability of LLM to construct a virtual, nested scene to jailbreak, which realizes an adaptive way to escape the usage control in a normal scenario. Empirically, DeepInception can achieve competitive jailbreak success rates with previous counterparts and realize a continuous jailbreak in subsequent interactions, which reveals the critical weakness of self-losing on both open-source and closed-source LLMs like Falcon, Vicuna-v1.5, Llama-2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4.

Recent studies have highlighted various neural metrics that align well with human evaluations. Yet, the robustness of these evaluators against adversarial perturbations remains largely under-explored due to the unique challenges in obtaining adversarial data for different NLG evaluation tasks. To address the problem, we introduce AdvEval, a novel black-box adversarial framework against NLG evaluators. AdvEval is specially tailored to generate data that yield strong disagreements between human and victim evaluators. Specifically, inspired by the recent success of large language models (LLMs) in text generation and evaluation, we adopt strong LLMs as both the data generator and gold evaluator. Adversarial data are automatically optimized with feedback from the gold and victim evaluator. We conduct experiments on 12 victim evaluators and 11 NLG datasets, spanning tasks including dialogue, summarization, and question evaluation. The results show that AdvEval can lead to significant performance degradation of various victim metrics, thereby validating its efficacy.</p></details> | ACL24 Finding |

Nevertheless, these models face challenges in processing large files, primarily due to their input constraints, which are generally restricted to hundreds or thousands of tokens. Attempts to address this issue in existing models usually consist in extracting only a fraction of the essential information from lengthy inputs, while often incurring high computational costs due to their complex architectures. In this work, we address the challenge of classifying large files from the perspective of correlated multiple instance learning. We introduce LaFiCMIL, a method specifically designed for large file classification. LaFiCMIL is optimized for efficient operation on a single GPU, making it a versatile solution for binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments using seven diverse and comprehensive benchmark datasets to assess LaFiCMIL's effectiveness. By integrating BERT for feature extraction, LaFiCMIL demonstrates exceptional performance, setting new benchmarks across all datasets. A notable achievement of our approach is its ability to scale BERT to handle nearly 20,000 tokens while operating on a single GPU with 32GB of memory. This efficiency, coupled with its state-of-the-art performance, highlights LaFiCMIL's potential as a groundbreaking approach in the field of large file classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NLDB 2024</p></details> |

However, these existing simulators face significant limitations. Firstly, they struggle with handling large numbers of agents due to high resource demands. Secondly, they often assume agents possess perfect information and limitless capabilities, hindering the ecological validity of simulated social interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose a multi-agent Minecraft simulator, MineLand, that bridges this gap by introducing three key features: large-scale scalability, limited multimodal senses, and physical needs. Our simulator supports 64 or more agents. Agents have limited visual, auditory, and environmental awareness, forcing them to actively communicate and collaborate to fulfill physical needs like food and resources. Additionally, we further introduce an AI agent framework, Alex, inspired by multitasking theory, enabling agents to handle intricate coordination and scheduling. Our experiments demonstrate that the simulator, the corresponding benchmark, and the AI agent framework contribute to more ecological and nuanced collective behavior.The source code of MineLand and Alex is openly available at https://github.com/cocacola-lab/MineLand.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://github.com/cocacola-lab/MineLand</p></details> |

However, their interpretability remains a challenge, hindering their adoption in critical applications. This research proposes a novel approach to enhance the interpretability of MLLMs by focusing on the image embedding component. We combine an open-world localization model with a MLLM, thus creating a new architecture able to simultaneously produce text and object localization outputs from the same vision embedding. The proposed architecture greatly promotes interpretability, enabling us to design a novel saliency map to explain any output token, to identify model hallucinations, and to assess model biases through semantic adversarial perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Watermark for Low-entropy and Unbiased Generation in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14604v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have highlighted the risk of misuse, raising concerns about accurately detecting LLM-generated content. A viable solution for the detection problem is to inject imperceptible identifiers into LLMs, known as watermarks. Previous work demonstrates that unbiased watermarks ensure unforgeability and preserve text quality by maintaining the expectation of the LLM output probability distribution. However, previous unbiased watermarking methods are impractical for local deployment because they rely on accesses to white-box LLMs and input prompts during detection. Moreover, these methods fail to provide statistical guarantees for the type II error of watermark detection. This study proposes the Sampling One Then Accepting (STA-1) method, an unbiased watermark that does not require access to LLMs nor prompts during detection and has statistical guarantees for the type II error. Moreover, we propose a novel tradeoff between watermark strength and text quality in unbiased watermarks. We show that in low-entropy scenarios, unbiased watermarks face a tradeoff between watermark strength and the risk of unsatisfactory outputs. Experimental results on low-entropy and high-entropy datasets demonstrate that STA-1 achieves text quality and watermark strength comparable to existing unbiased watermarks, with a low risk of unsatisfactory outputs. Implementation codes for this study are available online.</p></details> |  |

This study addresses two such biases within LLMs: \textit{representative bias}, which denotes a tendency of LLMs to generate outputs that mirror the experiences of certain identity groups, and \textit{affinity bias}, reflecting the models' evaluative preferences for specific narratives or viewpoints. We introduce two novel metrics to measure these biases: the Representative Bias Score (RBS) and the Affinity Bias Score (ABS), and present the Creativity-Oriented Generation Suite (CoGS), a collection of open-ended tasks such as short story writing and poetry composition, designed with customized rubrics to detect these subtle biases. Our analysis uncovers marked representative biases in prominent LLMs, with a preference for identities associated with being white, straight, and men. Furthermore, our investigation of affinity bias reveals distinctive evaluative patterns within each model, akin to `bias fingerprints'. This trend is also seen in human evaluators, highlighting a complex interplay between human and machine bias perceptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (excluding references), accepted to ACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

For example, if a LVLM was released on January 2024, and it wouldn't know the detailed plot of the new movie Dune 2, which wasn't released until February 2024. To solve the problem, a promising solution is to provide LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge via internet search during inference, i.e., internet-augmented generation (IAG), which is already integrated in some closed-source commercial LVLMs such as GPT-4V. However, the specific mechanics underpinning them remain a mystery. In this paper, we propose a plug-and-play framework, for augmenting existing LVLMs in handling visual question answering (VQA) about up-to-date knowledge, dubbed UDKAG. A hierarchical filtering model is trained to effectively and efficiently find the most helpful content from the websites returned by a search engine to prompt LVLMs with up-to-date knowledge. To train the model and evaluate our framework's performance, we propose a pipeline to automatically generate news-related VQA samples to construct a dataset, dubbed UDK-VQA. A multi-model voting mechanism is introduced to label the usefulness of website/content for VQA samples to construct the training set. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, outperforming GPT-4V by about 25% in accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, a framework to augment large vision-language models with up-to-date knowledge</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved significant success across various general tasks. However, their effectiveness and limitations in the education domain are yet to be fully explored. In this work, we examine the proficiency of LLMs in generating succinct survey articles specific to the niche field of NLP in computer science, focusing on a curated list of 99 topics. Automated benchmarks reveal that GPT-4 surpasses its predecessors, inluding GPT-3.5, PaLM2, and LLaMa2 by margins ranging from 2% to 20% in comparison to the established ground truth. We compare both human and GPT-based evaluation scores and provide in-depth analysis. While our findings suggest that GPT-created surveys are more contemporary and accessible than human-authored ones, certain limitations were observed. Notably, GPT-4, despite often delivering outstanding content, occasionally exhibited lapses like missing details or factual errors. At last, we compared the rating behavior between humans and GPT-4 and found systematic bias in using GPT evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, a drawback is their limited scalability to large data sets. To alleviate this, we consider full-scale approximations (FSAs) that combine predictive process methods and covariance tapering, thus approximating both global and local structures. We show how iterative methods can be used to reduce the computational costs for calculating likelihoods, gradients, and predictive distributions with FSAs. We introduce a novel preconditioner and show that it accelerates the conjugate gradient method's convergence speed and mitigates its sensitivity with respect to the FSA parameters and the eigenvalue structure of the original covariance matrix, and we demonstrate empirically that it outperforms a state-of-the-art pivoted Cholesky preconditioner. Further, we present a novel, accurate, and fast way to calculate predictive variances relying on stochastic estimations and iterative methods. In both simulated and real-world data experiments, we find that our proposed methodology achieves the same accuracy as Cholesky-based computations with a substantial reduction in computational time. Finally, we also compare different approaches for determining inducing points in predictive process and FSA models. All methods are implemented in a free C++ software library with high-level Python and R packages.</p></details> |  |

However, challenges such as jailbreaks (prompt injections that cause an LLM to follow instructions contrary to its intended use), hallucinations (generating incorrect or misleading information), and comprehension errors remain prevalent. In this report, we present a comparative analysis of the performance of fifteen distinct models, with each model undergoing a standardized test comprising 38 queries across three key metrics: jailbreaks, hallucinations, and comprehension errors. The models are assessed based on the total occurrences of jailbreaks, hallucinations, and comprehension errors. Our work exposes these models' inherent vulnerabilities and challenges the notion of human-level language comprehension of these models. We have empirically analysed the impact of non-standard Unicode characters on LLMs and their safeguarding mechanisms on the best-performing LLMs, including GPT-4, Gemini 1.5 Pro, LlaMA-3-70B, and Claude 3 Opus. By incorporating alphanumeric symbols from Unicode outside the standard Latin block and variants of characters in other languages, we observed a reduction in the efficacy of guardrails implemented through Reinforcement Learning Human Feedback (RLHF). Consequently, these models exhibit heightened vulnerability to content policy breaches and prompt leakage. Our study also suggests a need to incorporate non-standard Unicode text in LLM training data to enhance the capabilities of these models.</p></details> | 46 pages |

LLMs trained on massive textual datasets showed ability to encode not only context but also ability to provide powerful comprehension to downstream tasks. Interestingly, Generative Pre-trained Transformers utilised this ability to bring AI a step closer to human being replacement in at least datacentric applications. Such power can be leveraged to identify anomalies of cyber threats, enhance incident response, and automate routine security operations. We provide an overview for the recent activities of LLMs in cyber defence sections, as well as categorization for the cyber defence sections such as threat intelligence, vulnerability assessment, network security, privacy preserving, awareness and training, automation, and ethical guidelines. Fundamental concepts of the progression of LLMs from Transformers, Pre-trained Transformers, and GPT is presented. Next, the recent works of each section is surveyed with the related strengths and weaknesses. A special section about the challenges and directions of LLMs in cyber security is provided.

This paper presents RefChecker, a framework that introduces claim-triplets to represent claims in LLM responses, aiming to detect fine-grained hallucinations. In RefChecker, an extractor generates claim-triplets from a response, which are then evaluated by a checker against a reference. We delineate three task settings: Zero, Noisy and Accurate Context, to reflect various real-world use cases. We curated a benchmark spanning various NLP tasks and annotated 11k claim-triplets from 2.1k responses by seven LLMs. RefChecker supports both proprietary and open-source models as the extractor and checker. Experiments demonstrate that claim-triplets enable superior hallucination detection, compared to other granularities such as response, sentence and sub-sentence level claims. RefChecker outperforms prior methods by 6.8 to 26.1 points on our benchmark and the checking results of RefChecker are strongly aligned with human judgments.

Two Convolutional Neural Networks models for classification and segmentation were developed to detect and localize DoS respectively. It achieves detection and localization accuracies of 95.8% and 91.7%, and precision rates of 98.5% and 99.3% in a 16x16 mesh NoC. The framework's hardware overhead notably decreases by 76.3% when scaling from 8x8 to 16x16 NoCs, and it requires 42.4% less hardware compared to state-of-the-arts. This advancement demonstrates DL2Fence's effectiveness in balancing outstanding detection performance in large-scale NoCs with extremely low hardware overhead.</p></details> |  |

Despite the recent surge of interest in LLMs there is still a lack of understanding of how to design LLM-based automation tools and how to robustly evaluate their performance. During the 2023 Evidence Synthesis Hackathon we conducted two feasibility studies. Firstly, to automatically extract study characteristics from human clinical, animal, and social science domain studies. We used two studies from each category for prompt-development; and ten for evaluation. Secondly, we used the LLM to predict Participants, Interventions, Controls and Outcomes (PICOs) labelled within 100 abstracts in the EBM-NLP dataset. Overall, results indicated an accuracy of around 80%, with some variability between domains (82% for human clinical, 80% for animal, and 72% for studies of human social sciences). Causal inference methods and study design were the data extraction items with the most errors. In the PICO study, participants and intervention/control showed high accuracy (>80%), outcomes were more challenging. Evaluation was done manually; scoring methods such as BLEU and ROUGE showed limited value. We observed variability in the LLMs predictions and changes in response quality. This paper presents a template for future evaluations of LLMs in the context of data extraction for systematic review automation. Our results show that there might be value in using LLMs, for example as second or third reviewers. However, caution is advised when integrating models such as GPT-4 into tools. Further research on stability and reliability in practical settings is warranted for each type of data that is processed by the LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference proceedings, peer-reviewed and presented at the 3rd Workshop on Augmented Intelligence for Technology-Assisted Reviews Systems, Glasgow, 2024</p></details> |

However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.</p></details> |  |

Current smart robots are created using manual programming, mathematical models, planning frameworks, and reinforcement learning. These methods do not lead to the leaps in performance and generality seen with deep learning, generative AI, and foundation models (FMs). Today's robots do not learn to provide home care, to be nursing assistants, or to do household chores nearly as well as people do. Addressing the aspirational opportunities of robot service applications requires improving how they are created. The high cost of bipedal multi-sensory robots ("bodies") is a significant obstacle for both research and deployment. A deeper issue is that mainstream FMs ("minds") do not support sensing, acting, and learning in context in the real world. They do not lead to robots that communicate well or collaborate. They do not lead to robots that try to learn by experimenting, by asking others, or by imitation learning as appropriate. They do not lead to robots that know enough to be deployed widely in service applications. This paper focuses on what human-compatible service robots need to know. It recommends developing experiential (aka "robotic") FMs for bootstrapping them.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Annotation Free Semantic Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09307v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Segmentation is one of the most challenging vision tasks, usually requiring large amounts of training data with expensive pixel level annotations. With the success of foundation models and especially vision-language models, recent works attempt to achieve zeroshot semantic segmentation while requiring either large-scale training or additional image/pixel level annotations. In this work, we generate free annotations for any semantic segmentation dataset using existing foundation models. We use CLIP to detect objects and SAM to generate high quality object masks. Next, we build a lightweight module on top of a self-supervised vision encoder, DinoV2, to align the patch features with a pretrained text encoder for zeroshot semantic segmentation. Our approach can bring language-based semantics to any pretrained vision encoder with minimal training. Our module is lightweight, uses foundation models as the sole source of supervision and shows impressive generalization capability from little training data with no annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt Tuning Strikes Back: Customizing Foundation Models with Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15282v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) has become the standard for customising Foundation Models (FMs) to user-specific downstream tasks. However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LOPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter. LOPA generates soft prompts by balancing between sharing task-specific information across instances and customization for each instance. It uses a low-rank decomposition of the soft-prompt component encoded for each instance to achieve parameter efficiency. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on multiple natural language understanding and code generation and understanding tasks across a wide range of foundation models with varying sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, many of these approaches introduce additional complexity, can require multiple training steps and often have a performance cost in comparison to black-box approaches. In this work, we introduce Component Features (ComFe), a novel interpretable-by-design image classification approach that is highly scalable and can obtain better accuracy and robustness in comparison to non-interpretable methods. Inspired by recent developments in computer vision foundation models, ComFe uses a transformer-decoder head and a hierarchical mixture-modelling approach with a foundation model backbone to obtain higher accuracy compared to previous interpretable models across a range of fine-grained vision benchmarks, without the need to individually tune hyper-parameters for each dataset. With only global image labels and no segmentation or part annotations, ComFe can identify consistent component features within an image and determine which of these features are informative in making a prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[EHRMamba: Towards Generalizable and Scalable Foundation Models for Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14567v2)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have significantly advanced the modeling of Electronic Health Records (EHR), yet their deployment in real-world healthcare is limited by several key challenges. Firstly, the quadratic computational cost and insufficient context length of these models pose significant obstacles for hospitals in processing the extensive medical histories typical in EHR data. Additionally, existing models employ separate finetuning for each clinical task, complicating maintenance in healthcare environments. Moreover, these models focus exclusively on either clinical prediction or EHR forecasting, lacking the flexibility to perform well across both. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EHRMamba, a robust foundation model built on the Mamba architecture. EHRMamba can process sequences up to four times longer than previous models due to its linear computational cost. We also introduce a novel approach to Multitask Prompted Finetuning (MTF) for EHR data, which enables EHRMamba to simultaneously learn multiple clinical tasks in a single finetuning phase, significantly enhancing deployment and cross-task generalization. Furthermore, our model leverages the HL7 FHIR data standard to simplify integration into existing hospital systems. Alongside EHRMamba, we open-source Odyssey, a toolkit designed to support the development and deployment of EHR foundation models, with an emphasis on data standardization and interpretability. Our evaluations on the MIMIC-IV dataset demonstrate that EHRMamba advances state-of-the-art performance across 6 major clinical tasks and excels in EHR forecasting, marking a significant leap forward in the field.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 4 Figures |
| **[Intelligent Go-Explore: Standing on the Shoulders of Giant Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15143v1)** | 2024-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Go-Explore is a powerful family of algorithms designed to solve hard-exploration problems, built on the principle of archiving discovered states, and iteratively returning to and exploring from the most promising states. This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration, which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g. discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting and previously impossible opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries that cannot be predicted ahead of time. We evaluate IGE on a range of language-based tasks that require search and exploration. In Game of 24, a multistep mathematical reasoning problem, IGE reaches 100% success rate 70.8% faster than the best classic graph search baseline. Next, in BabyAI-Text, a challenging partially observable gridworld, IGE exceeds the previous SOTA with orders of magnitude fewer online samples. Finally, in TextWorld, we show the unique ability of IGE to succeed in settings requiring long-horizon exploration where prior SOTA FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, IGE combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-grained Image-to-LiDAR Contrastive Distillation with Visual Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14271v1)** | 2024-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive image-to-LiDAR knowledge transfer, commonly used for learning 3D representations with synchronized images and point clouds, often faces a self-conflict dilemma. This issue arises as contrastive losses unintentionally dissociate features of unmatched points and pixels that share semantic labels, compromising the integrity of learned representations. To overcome this, we harness Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which have revolutionized the acquisition of pixel-level semantics, to enhance 3D representation learning. Specifically, we utilize off-the-shelf VFMs to generate semantic labels for weakly-supervised pixel-to-point contrastive distillation. Additionally, we employ von Mises-Fisher distributions to structure the feature space, ensuring semantic embeddings within the same class remain consistent across varying inputs. Furthermore, we adapt sampling probabilities of points to address imbalances in spatial distribution and category frequency, promoting comprehensive and balanced learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates the challenges posed by traditional methods and consistently surpasses existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |

STAR is developed for prevalent speech foundation models based on Transformer-related architecture with auto-regressive decoding (e.g., Whisper, Canary). Specifically, we propose a novel indicator that empirically integrates step-wise information during decoding to assess the token-level quality of pseudo labels without ground truth, thereby guiding model updates for effective unsupervised adaptation. Experimental results show that STAR achieves an average of 13.5% relative reduction in word error rate across 14 target domains, and it sometimes even approaches the upper-bound performance of supervised adaptation. Surprisingly, we also observe that STAR prevents the adapted model from the common catastrophic forgetting problem without recalling source-domain data. Furthermore, STAR exhibits high data efficiency that only requires less than one-hour unlabeled data, and seamless generality to alternative large speech models and speech translation tasks. Our code aims to open source to the research communities.</p></details> | 23 pages, Preprint |

The challenge is the lack of labeled data for the training of foundation model. To handle this issue, a CLIP-style retinal image foundation model is developed in this paper. Our foundation model, RET-CLIP, is specifically trained on a dataset of 193,865 patients to extract general features of color fundus photographs (CFPs), employing a tripartite optimization strategy to focus on left eye, right eye, and patient level to reflect real-world clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RET-CLIP outperforms existing benchmarks across eight diverse datasets spanning four critical diagnostic categories: diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, multiple disease diagnosis, and multi-label classification of multiple diseases, which demonstrate the performance and generality of our foundation model.

However, the scarce radio resources and stringent latency requirement make it challenging to meet these demands. To tackle these challenges, over-the-air computation (AirComp) emerges as a potential technology. Specifically, AirComp seamlessly integrates the communication and computation procedures through the superposition property of multiple-access channels, which yields a revolutionary multiple-access paradigm shift from "compute-after-communicate" to "compute-when-communicate". By this means, AirComp enables spectral-efficient and low-latency wireless data aggregation by allowing multiple devices to occupy the same channel for transmission. In this paper, we aim to present the recent advancement of AirComp in terms of foundations, technologies, and applications. The mathematical form and communication design are introduced as the foundations of AirComp, and the critical issues of AirComp over different network architectures are then discussed along with the review of existing literature. The technologies employed for the analysis and optimization on AirComp are reviewed from the information theory and signal processing perspectives. Moreover, we present the existing studies that tackle the practical implementation issues in AirComp systems, and elaborate the applications of AirComp in Internet of Things and edge intelligent networks. Finally, potential research directions are highlighted to motivate the future development of AirComp.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |

Our model, called BrainMorph, serves as a tool that supports multi-modal, pairwise, and scalable groupwise registration. BrainMorph is trained on a massive dataset of over 100,000 3D volumes, skull-stripped and non-skull-stripped, from nearly 16,000 unique healthy and diseased subjects. BrainMorph is robust to large misalignments, interpretable via interrogating automatically-extracted keypoints, and enables rapid and controllable generation of many plausible transformations with different alignment types and different degrees of nonlinearity at test-time. We demonstrate the superiority of BrainMorph in solving 3D rigid, affine, and nonlinear registration on a variety of multi-modal brain MRI scans of healthy and diseased subjects, in both the pairwise and groupwise setting. In particular, we show registration accuracy and speeds that surpass current state-of-the-art methods, especially in the context of large initial misalignments and large group settings.

| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training:Toward Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v1)** | 2024-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |

However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H&E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.</p></details> |  |

Human-designed simulation algorithms excel at capturing the fundamental physics of engineering problems, but often need to balance the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. While deep learning methods offer innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. FMint bridges these gaps through conditioning on the initial coarse solutions obtained from conventional human-designed algorithms, and trained to obtain refined solutions for various differential equations. Based on the backbone of large language models, we adapt the in-context learning scheme to learn a universal error correction method for dynamical systems from given prompted sequences of coarse solutions. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 600K ordinary differential equations (ODEs), and we conduct extensive experiments on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution tasks. FMint outperforms various baselines on large-scale simulation, and demonstrates its capability in generalization to unseen ODEs. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Given the diversity in architectures, training data and instruction tuning techniques, there can be large variations in systems' susceptibility to hallucinations. To assess system hallucination robustness, hallucination ranking approaches have been developed for specific tasks such as image captioning, question answering, summarization, or biography generation. However, these approaches typically compare model outputs to gold-standard references or labels, limiting hallucination benchmarking for new domains. This work proposes "CrossCheckGPT", a reference-free universal hallucination ranking for multimodal foundation models. The core idea of CrossCheckGPT is that the same hallucinated content is unlikely to be generated by different independent systems, hence cross-system consistency can provide meaningful and accurate hallucination assessment scores. CrossCheckGPT can be applied to any model or task, provided that the information consistency between outputs can be measured through an appropriate distance metric. Focusing on multimodal large language models that generate text, we explore two information consistency measures: CrossCheck-explicit and CrossCheck-implicit. We showcase the applicability of our method for hallucination ranking across various modalities, namely the text, image, and audio-visual domains. Further, we propose the first audio-visual hallucination benchmark, "AVHalluBench", and illustrate the effectiveness of CrossCheckGPT, achieving correlations of 98% and 89% with human judgements on MHaluBench and AVHalluBench, respectively.</p></details> | 21 pages.

Despite producing high-quality samples, existing methods are constrained to generating images of scenes at a limited scale. In this paper, we present MetaEarth, a generative foundation model that breaks the barrier by scaling image generation to a global level, exploring the creation of worldwide, multi-resolution, unbounded, and virtually limitless remote sensing images. In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earth visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiupinjia.github.io/metaearth/</p></details> |

Nonetheless, how fine-tuning impacts performance in long-tail learning was not explicitly quantified. In this paper, we disclose that heavy fine-tuning may even lead to non-negligible performance deterioration on tail classes, and lightweight fine-tuning is more effective. The reason is attributed to inconsistent class conditions caused by heavy fine-tuning. With the observation above, we develop a low-complexity and accurate long-tail learning algorithms LIFT with the goal of facilitating fast prediction and compact models by adaptive lightweight fine-tuning. Experiments clearly verify that both the training time and the learned parameters are significantly reduced with more accurate predictive performance compared with state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024.

Deep learning models can identify images across various semantic concepts without the need for annotations. This work proposes to use Geospatial Foundation Models, like Prithvi, for remote sensing image retrieval with multiple benefits: i) the models encode multi-spectral satellite data and ii) generalize without further fine-tuning. We introduce two datasets to the retrieval task and observe a strong performance: Prithvi processes six bands and achieves a mean Average Precision of 97.62% on BigEarthNet-43 and 44.51% on ForestNet-12, outperforming other RGB-based models. Further, we evaluate three compression methods with binarized embeddings balancing retrieval speed and accuracy.

VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing AI models in this domain often require extensive annotation and are task-specific, limiting their clinical utility. While recent developments have brought about foundation models for ophthalmology, they are limited by the need to train separate weights for each imaging modality, preventing a comprehensive representation of multi-modal features. This highlights the need for versatile foundation models capable of handling various tasks and modalities in ophthalmology. To address this gap, we present EyeFound, a multimodal foundation model for ophthalmic images. Unlike existing models, EyeFound learns generalizable representations from unlabeled multimodal retinal images, enabling efficient model adaptation across multiple applications. Trained on 2.78 million images from 227 hospitals across 11 ophthalmic modalities, EyeFound facilitates generalist representations and diverse multimodal downstream tasks, even for detecting challenging rare diseases. It outperforms previous work RETFound in diagnosing eye diseases, predicting systemic disease incidents, and zero-shot multimodal VQA. EyeFound provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and lessen the annotation burden on experts, facilitating widespread clinical AI applications for retinal imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |

However, our investigation shows that despite these gains, their potential for real-world applications is restricted by their limited generalization capabilities to novel image domains. In this paper, we introduce OmniGlue, the first learnable image matcher that is designed with generalization as a core principle. OmniGlue leverages broad knowledge from a vision foundation model to guide the feature matching process, boosting generalization to domains not seen at training time. Additionally, we propose a novel keypoint position-guided attention mechanism which disentangles spatial and appearance information, leading to enhanced matching descriptors. We perform comprehensive experiments on a suite of $7$ datasets with varied image domains, including scene-level, object-centric and aerial images. OmniGlue's novel components lead to relative gains on unseen domains of $20.9\%$ with respect to a directly comparable reference model, while also outperforming the recent LightGlue method by $9.5\%$ relatively.Code and model can be found at https://hwjiang1510.github.io/OmniGlue</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection, and recognition of relevant objects. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9 imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/biomedparse-project</p></details> |
| **[Is Dataset Quality Still a Concern in Diagnosis Using Large Foundation Model?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12584v1)** | 2024-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in pre-trained large foundation models (LFM) have yielded significant breakthroughs across various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. These models have been particularly impactful in the domain of medical diagnostic tasks. With abundant unlabeled data, an LFM has been developed for fundus images using the Vision Transformer (VIT) and a self-supervised learning framework. This LFM has shown promising performance in fundus disease diagnosis across multiple datasets. On the other hand, deep learning models have long been challenged by dataset quality issues, such as image quality and dataset bias. To investigate the influence of data quality on LFM, we conducted explorations in two fundus diagnosis tasks using datasets of varying quality. Specifically, we explored the following questions: Is LFM more robust to image quality? Is LFM affected by dataset bias? Can fine-tuning techniques alleviate these effects? Our investigation found that LFM exhibits greater resilience to dataset quality issues, including image quality and dataset bias, compared to typical convolutional networks. Furthermore, we discovered that overall fine-tuning is an effective adapter for LFM to mitigate the impact of dataset quality issues.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Current solutions in this field remain rooted in conventional deep learning paradigms, requiring the construction of annotated datasets and the design of network architectures. However, the evident drawback with these mainstream solutions lies in the time-consuming and labor-intensive process of curating datasets, alongside the increasing complexity of model structures. In this paper, we propose to address these issues by fully harnessing the capabilities of two existing vision foundation models (VFMs): Stable Diffusion and Segment Anything Model (SAM). Firstly, we construct a Synthetic but photorealistic large-scale Glass Surface Detection dataset, dubbed S-GSD, without any labour cost via Stable Diffusion. This dataset consists of four different scales, consisting of 168k images totally with precise masks. Besides, based on the powerful segmentation ability of SAM, we devise a simple Glass surface sEgMentor named GEM, which follows the simple query-based encoder-decoder architecture. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the large-scale glass segmentation dataset GSD-S. Our GEM establishes a new state-of-the-art performance with the help of these two VFMs, surpassing the best-reported method GlassSemNet with an IoU improvement of 2.1%. Additionally, extensive experiments demonstrate that our synthetic dataset S-GSD exhibits remarkable performance in zero-shot and transfer learning settings.

Foundation models hold the promise to also transform our ability to model our planet and its subsystems by exploiting the vast expanse of Earth system data. Here we introduce Aurora, a large-scale foundation model of the atmosphere trained on over a million hours of diverse weather and climate data. Aurora leverages the strengths of the foundation modelling approach to produce operational forecasts for a wide variety of atmospheric prediction problems, including those with limited training data, heterogeneous variables, and extreme events. In under a minute, Aurora produces 5-day global air pollution predictions and 10-day high-resolution weather forecasts that outperform state-of-the-art classical simulation tools and the best specialized deep learning models. Taken together, these results indicate that foundation models can transform environmental forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</p></details> |  |

Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

We have curated a distinctive dataset of 283,582 unique video clips categorized under 386 hashtags relating to modern human actions. We release this dataset as a valuable resource for building domain-specific foundation models for human movement modeling tasks such as action recognition. To validate this dataset, which we name TikTokActions, we perform two sets of experiments. First, we pretrain the state-of-the-art VideoMAEv2 with a ViT-base backbone on TikTokActions subset, and then fine-tune and evaluate on popular datasets such as UCF101 and the HMDB51. We find that the performance of the model pre-trained using our Tik-Tok dataset is comparable to models trained on larger action recognition datasets (95.3% on UCF101 and 53.24% on HMDB51). Furthermore, our investigation into the relationship between pre-training dataset size and fine-tuning performance reveals that beyond a certain threshold, the incremental benefit of larger training sets diminishes. This work introduces a useful TikTok video dataset that is available for public use and provides insights into the marginal benefit of increasing pre-training dataset sizes for video-based foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Addressing this challenge, we introduce an algorithm designed to achieve accurate self-supervised stereo depth estimation focusing on nighttime conditions. Specifically, we use pretrained visual foundation models to extract generalised features across challenging scenes and present an efficient method for matching and integrating these features from stereo frames. Moreover, to prevent pixels violating photometric consistency assumption from negatively affecting the depth predictions, we propose a novel masking approach designed to filter out such pixels. Lastly, addressing weaknesses in the evaluation of current depth estimation algorithms, we present novel evaluation metrics.

A Study Based on Moral Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11100v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have taken centre stage in debates on Artificial Intelligence. Yet there remains a gap in how to assess LLMs' conformity to important human values. In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 (Gemini Pro and LLAMA 2 did not generate valid results) are moral hypocrites. We employ two research instruments based on the Moral Foundations Theory: (i) the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), which investigates which values are considered morally relevant in abstract moral judgements; and (ii) the Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs), which evaluate moral cognition in concrete scenarios related to each moral foundation. We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy. We found that both models displayed reasonable consistency within each instrument compared to humans, but they displayed contradictory and hypocritical behaviour when we compared the abstract values present in the MFQ to the evaluation of concrete moral violations of the MFV.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This paradigm has extended to other modalities, including speech, where researchers are actively exploring the combination of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and LLMs into single, unified models capable of addressing multimodal tasks. Among such tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice. Lastly, we outline recommendations for future works on the topic aimed at better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the SFM+LLM solutions for ST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |

The application of FMs in autonomous driving holds considerable promise. For example, they can contribute to enhancing scene understanding and reasoning. By pre-training on rich linguistic and visual data, FMs can understand and interpret various elements in a driving scene, and provide cognitive reasoning to give linguistic and action instructions for driving decisions and planning. Furthermore, FMs can augment data based on the understanding of driving scenarios to provide feasible scenes of those rare occurrences in the long tail distribution that are unlikely to be encountered during routine driving and data collection. The enhancement can subsequently lead to improvement in the accuracy and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Another testament to the potential of FMs' applications lies in World Models, exemplified by the DREAMER series, which showcases the ability to comprehend physical laws and dynamics. Learning from massive data under the paradigm of self-supervised learning, World Model can generate unseen yet plausible driving environments, facilitating the enhancement in the prediction of road users' behaviors and the off-line training of driving strategies. In this paper, we synthesize the applications and future trends of FMs in autonomous driving. By utilizing the powerful capabilities of FMs, we strive to tackle the potential issues stemming from the long-tail distribution in autonomous driving, consequently advancing overall safety in this domain.</p></details> | 45 pages,8 figures |

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 16 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Brain Lesion Segmentation with Mixture of Modality Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10246v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain lesion segmentation plays an essential role in neurological research and diagnosis. As brain lesions can be caused by various pathological alterations, different types of brain lesions tend to manifest with different characteristics on different imaging modalities. Due to this complexity, brain lesion segmentation methods are often developed in a task-specific manner. A specific segmentation model is developed for a particular lesion type and imaging modality. However, the use of task-specific models requires predetermination of the lesion type and imaging modality, which complicates their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a universal foundation model for 3D brain lesion segmentation, which can automatically segment different types of brain lesions for input data of various imaging modalities. We formulate a novel Mixture of Modality Experts (MoME) framework with multiple expert networks attending to different imaging modalities. A hierarchical gating network combines the expert predictions and fosters expertise collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy during training to avoid the degeneration of each expert network and preserve their specialization. We evaluated the proposed method on nine brain lesion datasets, encompassing five imaging modalities and eight lesion types. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art universal models and provides promising generalization to unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work has been early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, its application to time series data, particularly within foundational models, remains underexplored. This paper examines the impact of LoRA on contemporary time series foundational models: Lag-Llama, MOIRAI, and Chronos. We demonstrate LoRA's fine-tuning potential for forecasting the vital signs of sepsis patients in intensive care units (ICUs), emphasizing the models' adaptability to previously unseen, out-of-domain modalities. Integrating LoRA aims to enhance forecasting performance while reducing inefficiencies associated with fine-tuning large models on limited domain-specific data. Our experiments show that LoRA fine-tuning of time series foundational models significantly improves forecasting, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art models trained from scratch on similar modalities. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the trade-offs between the number of tunable parameters and forecasting performance and assess the impact of varying LoRA matrix ranks on model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures.

In reality, an ideal robust model will probably behave similarly to the oracle (e.g., the human users), thus a good evaluation protocol is probably to evaluate the models' behaviors in comparison to the oracle. In this paper, we introduce a new robustness measurement that directly measures the image classification model's performance compared with a surrogate oracle (i.e., a foundation model). Besides, we design a simple method that can accomplish the evaluation beyond the scope of the benchmarks. Our method extends the image datasets with new samples that are sufficiently perturbed to be distinct from the ones in the original sets, but are still bounded within the same image-label structure the original test image represents, constrained by a foundation model pretrained with a large amount of samples. As a result, our new method will offer us a new way to evaluate the models' robustness performance, free of limitations of fixed benchmarks or constrained perturbations, although scoped by the power of the oracle. In addition to the evaluation results, we also leverage our generated data to understand the behaviors of the model and our new evaluation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024 Poster</p></details> |

Histopathology foundation models show promise across many tasks, but analyses have been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task/dataset. We report the most rigorous single-task validation conducted to date of a histopathology foundation model, and the first performed in ovarian cancer subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using vision transformer and ResNet features generated through varied preprocessing and pretraining procedures. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Hospitals. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for evaluation on a hold-out test set and an external set from the Transcanadian study. Reporting followed the TRIPOD+AI checklist. The vision transformer-based histopathology foundation model, UNI, performed best in every evaluation, with five-class balanced accuracies of 88% and 93% in hold-out internal and external testing, compared to the best ResNet model scores of 68% and 81%, respectively. Normalisations and augmentations aided the generalisability of ResNet-based models, but these still did not match the performance of UNI, which gave the best external performance in any ovarian cancer subtyping study to date. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion in challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many-Shot In-Context Learning in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09798v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are well-known to be effective at few-shot in-context learning (ICL). Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have enabled unprecedentedly long context windows, presenting an opportunity to explore their capability to perform ICL with many more demonstrating examples. In this work, we evaluate the performance of multimodal foundation models scaling from few-shot to many-shot ICL. We benchmark GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro across 10 datasets spanning multiple domains (natural imagery, medical imagery, remote sensing, and molecular imagery) and tasks (multi-class, multi-label, and fine-grained classification). We observe that many-shot ICL, including up to almost 2,000 multimodal demonstrating examples, leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot (<100 examples) ICL across all of the datasets. Further, Gemini 1.5 Pro performance continues to improve log-linearly up to the maximum number of tested examples on many datasets. Given the high inference costs associated with the long prompts required for many-shot ICL, we also explore the impact of batching multiple queries in a single API call. We show that batching up to 50 queries can lead to performance improvements under zero-shot and many-shot ICL, with substantial gains in the zero-shot setting on multiple datasets, while drastically reducing per-query cost and latency. Finally, we measure ICL data efficiency of the models, or the rate at which the models learn from more demonstrating examples. We find that while GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro achieve similar zero-shot performance across the datasets, Gemini 1.5 Pro exhibits higher ICL data efficiency than GPT-4o on most datasets. Our results suggest that many-shot ICL could enable users to efficiently adapt multimodal foundation models to new applications and domains.

At least two methods can identify foundation models with potential dual-use capability; each has advantages and disadvantages: A. Open benchmarks (based on openly available questions and answers), which are low-cost but accuracy-limited by the need to omit security-sensitive details; and B. Closed red team evaluations (based on private evaluation by CBRN and cyber experts), which are higher-cost but can achieve higher accuracy by incorporating sensitive details. We propose a research and risk-management approach using a combination of methods including both open benchmarks and closed red team evaluations, in a way that leverages advantages of both methods. We recommend that one or more groups of researchers with sufficient resources and access to a range of near-frontier and frontier foundation models run a set of foundation models through dual-use capability evaluation benchmarks and red team evaluations, then analyze the resulting sets of models' scores on benchmark and red team evaluations to see how correlated those are. If, as we expect, there is substantial correlation between the dual-use potential benchmark scores and the red team evaluation scores, then implications include the following: The open benchmarks should be used frequently during foundation model development as a quick, low-cost measure of a model's dual-use potential; and if a particular model gets a high score on the dual-use potential benchmark, then more in-depth red team assessments of that model's dual-use capability should be performed. We also discuss limitations and mitigations for our approach, e.g., if model developers try to game benchmarks by including a version of benchmark test data in a model's training data.</p></details> | 62 pages |

SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions. The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications. Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods. This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor. A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task. First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images. Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR. We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, for specific applications, practitioners have been developing specialized application models. To enjoy the benefits of both kinds of models, one natural path is to transfer the knowledge in foundation models into specialized application models, which are generally more efficient for serving. Techniques from knowledge distillation may be applied here, where the application model learns to mimic the foundation model. However, specialized application models and foundation models have substantial gaps in capacity, employing distinct architectures, using different input features from different modalities, and being optimized on different distributions. These differences in model characteristics lead to significant challenges for distillation methods. In this work, we propose creating a teaching committee comprising both foundation model teachers and complementary teachers. Complementary teachers possess model characteristics akin to the student's, aiming to bridge the gap between the foundation model and specialized application models for a smoother knowledge transfer. Further, to accommodate the dissimilarity among the teachers in the committee, we introduce DiverseDistill, which allows the student to understand the expertise of each teacher and extract task knowledge. Our evaluations demonstrate that adding complementary teachers enhances student performance. Finally, DiverseDistill consistently outperforms baseline distillation methods, regardless of the teacher choices, resulting in significantly improved student performance.</p></details> |  |

There is an explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification tasks and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines (by 16% to 17% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability. https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip has models, data and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (oral) camera-ready version; data released</p></details> |

This highlights the need for efficient adaptation methods to adapt these models to endoscopic depth estimation. We propose Endoscopic Depth Any Camera (EndoDAC) which is an efficient self-supervised depth estimation framework that adapts foundation models to endoscopic scenes. Specifically, we develop the Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LoRA) and employ Convolutional Neck blocks to tailor the foundational model to the surgical domain, utilizing remarkably few trainable parameters. Given that camera information is not always accessible, we also introduce a self-supervised adaptation strategy that estimates camera intrinsics using the pose encoder. Our framework is capable of being trained solely on monocular surgical videos from any camera, ensuring minimal training costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains superior performance even with fewer training epochs and unaware of the ground truth camera intrinsics.

We argue, that this correctness needs to be foundational: correctness needs to be based on the operational semantics of their execution environment. In this work we present a foundational system - the DeepSEA system - targeting the Ethereum blockchain as the largest smart contract platform. The DeepSEA system has a small but sufficiently rich programming language amenable for verification, the DeepSEA language, and a verified DeepSEA compiler. Together they enable true end-to-end verification for smart contracts. We demonstrate usability through two case studies: a realistic contract for Decentralized Finance and contract for crowdfunding.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Billion-scale Foundation Model for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05215v3)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is the accepted version for IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (IEEE J-STARS)</p></details> |

Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large) and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024.

However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundational models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical records, imaging data, and patient outcomes. It employs data preprocessing techniques and transformer-based architectures to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of the embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models have been useful in natural language processing and some vision tasks for some time, the foundation model developed with image segmentation in mind - Segment Anything Model (SAM) - has been developed only recently and has shown similar promise. However, there are still no systematic analyses or "best-practice" guidelines for optimal fine-tuning of SAM for medical image segmentation. This work summarizes existing fine-tuning strategies with various backbone architectures, model components, and fine-tuning algorithms across 18 combinations, and evaluates them on 17 datasets covering all common radiology modalities. Our study reveals that (1) fine-tuning SAM leads to slightly better performance than previous segmentation methods, (2) fine-tuning strategies that use parameter-efficient learning in both the encoder and decoder are superior to other strategies, (3) network architecture has a small impact on final performance, (4) further training SAM with self-supervised learning can improve final model performance. We also demonstrate the ineffectiveness of some methods popular in the literature and further expand our experiments into few-shot and prompt-based settings. Lastly, we released our code and MRI-specific fine-tuned weights, which consistently obtained superior performance over the original SAM, at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM</p></details> |

We collected data from 18 researchers using an interface that we designed using network simplification methods and analyzed how users browsed and identified important papers. Our analysis reveals six major patterns used for identifying papers of interest, which can be categorized into three key components: Fields, Bridges, and Foundations, each viewed from two distinct perspectives: layout-oriented and connection-oriented. The connection-oriented approach was found to be more effective for selecting relevant papers, but the layout-oriented method was adopted more often, even though it led to unexpected results and user frustration. Our findings emphasize the importance of integrating these components and the necessity to balance visual layouts with meaningful connections to enhance the effectiveness of citation networks in academic browsing systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards a clinically accessible radiology foundation model: open-access and lightweight, with automated evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08002v4)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling laws and extraordinary performance of large foundation models motivate the development and utilization of such models in biomedicine. However, despite early promising results on some biomedical benchmarks, there are still major challenges that need to be addressed before these models can be used in real-world clinics. Frontier general-domain models such as GPT-4V still have significant performance gaps in multimodal biomedical applications. More importantly, less-acknowledged pragmatic issues, including accessibility, model cost, and tedious manual evaluation make it hard for clinicians to use state-of-the-art large models directly on private patient data. Here, we explore training open-source small multimodal models (SMMs) to bridge competency gaps for unmet clinical needs in radiology. To maximize data efficiency, we adopt a modular approach by incorporating state-of-the-art pre-trained models for image and text modalities, and focusing on training a lightweight adapter to ground each modality to the text embedding space, as exemplified by LLaVA-Med. For training, we assemble a large dataset of over 697 thousand radiology image-text pairs. For evaluation, we propose CheXprompt, a GPT-4-based metric for factuality evaluation, and demonstrate its parity with expert evaluation. For best practice, we conduct a systematic ablation study on various choices in data engineering and multimodal training. The resulting LlaVA-Rad (7B) model attains state-of-the-art results on standard radiology tasks such as report generation and cross-modal retrieval, even outperforming much larger models such as GPT-4V and Med-PaLM M (84B). The inference of LlaVA-Rad is fast and can be performed on a single V100 GPU in private settings, offering a promising state-of-the-art tool for real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for groundbreaking healthcare innovations.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Enhancing Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Multi-modal Foundation Models: An End-to-End Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06586v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a core computer vision problem, but the high costs of data annotation have hindered its wide application. Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) offers a cost-efficient workaround to extensive labeling in comparison to fully-supervised methods by using partial or incomplete labels. Existing WSSS methods have difficulties in learning the boundaries of objects leading to poor segmentation results. We propose a novel and effective framework that addresses these issues by leveraging visual foundation models inside the bounding box. Adopting a two-stage WSSS framework, our proposed network consists of a pseudo-label generation module and a segmentation module. The first stage leverages Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. To alleviate the problem of delineating precise boundaries, we adopt SAM inside the bounding box with the help of another pre-trained foundation model (e.g., Grounding-DINO). Furthermore, we eliminate the necessity of using the supervision of image labels, by employing CLIP in classification. Then in the second stage, the generated high-quality pseudo-labels are used to train an off-the-shelf segmenter that achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014.</p></details> |  |

We present a method for self-supervised domain adaptation for the scenario where annotated source domain data (e.g. from synthetic generation) is available, but the target domain data is completely unannotated. Our method targets the semantic segmentation task and leverages a segmentation foundation model (Segment Anything Model) to obtain segment information on unannotated data. We take inspiration from recent advances in unsupervised local feature learning and propose an invariance-variance loss over the detected segments for regularizing feature representations in the target domain. Crucially, this loss structure and network architecture can handle overlapping segments and oversegmentation as produced by Segment Anything. We demonstrate the advantage of our method on the challenging YCB-Video and HomebrewedDB datasets and show that it outperforms prior work and, on YCB-Video, even a network trained with real annotations. Additionally, we provide insight through model ablations and show applicability to a custom robotic application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<endoftext>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<endoftext>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</p></details> |  |

However, the field of experimental design, grounded on black-box optimization, has been much less affected by such a paradigm shift, even though integrating LLMs with optimization presents a unique landscape ripe for exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field of black-box optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their relationship with previous literature.

The currently emerging foundation models in the field of text, speech and image processing offer completely new possibilities for developing AI applications. This whitepaper shows how the trustworthiness of an AI application developed with foundation models can be evaluated and ensured. For this purpose, the application-specific, risk-based approach for testing and ensuring the trustworthiness of AI applications, as developed in the 'AI Assessment Catalog - Guideline for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence' by Fraunhofer IAIS, is transferred to the context of foundation models. Special consideration is given to the fact that specific risks of foundation models can have an impact on the AI application and must also be taken into account when checking trustworthiness.

It becomes a new open challenge to enable the foundation model to capture user preference changes in a timely manner with reasonable communication and computation costs while preserving privacy. This paper proposes a novel federated adaptation mechanism to enhance the foundation model-based recommendation system in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, each client will learn a lightweight personalized adapter using its private data. The adapter then collaborates with pre-trained foundation models to provide recommendation service efficiently with fine-grained manners. Importantly, users' private behavioral data remains secure as it is not shared with the server. This data localization-based privacy preservation is embodied via the federated learning framework. The model can ensure that shared knowledge is incorporated into all adapters while simultaneously preserving each user's personal preferences. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's superior performance.

We introduce a novel approach to create accurate, sparse foundational versions of performant LLMs that achieve full accuracy recovery for fine-tuning tasks at up to 70% sparsity. We achieve this for the LLaMA-2 7B model by combining the SparseGPT one-shot pruning method and sparse pretraining of those models on a subset of the SlimPajama dataset mixed with a Python subset of The Stack dataset. We exhibit training acceleration due to sparsity on Cerebras CS-3 chips that closely matches theoretical scaling. In addition, we establish inference acceleration of up to 3x on CPUs by utilizing Neural Magic's DeepSparse engine and 1.7x on GPUs through Neural Magic's nm-vllm engine. The above gains are realized via sparsity alone, thus enabling further gains through additional use of quantization. Specifically, we show a total speedup on CPUs for sparse-quantized LLaMA models of up to 8.6x. We demonstrate these results across diverse, challenging tasks, including chat, instruction following, code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and summarization to prove their generality.

However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for complex tasks. We propose a novel, theoretically sound method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that our approach CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset causal inference methodologies.</p></details> |  |

As the technique keeps attracting attention from the AI community, an increasing number of foundation models are becoming publicly accessible. However, a significant shortcoming of most of these models lies in their performance in specialized-domain and task-specific applications, necessitating domain- and task-aware fine-tuning to develop effective scientific language models. As the number of available foundation models and specialized tasks keeps growing, the job of training scientific language models becomes highly nontrivial. In this paper, we initiate steps to tackle this issue. We introduce an extensible and lightweight toolkit, LMFlow, which aims to simplify the domain- and task-aware finetuning of general foundation models. LMFlow offers a complete finetuning workflow for a foundation model to support specialized training with limited computing resources.

To this end, we present Foundation Model Embedded Gaussian Splatting (FMGS), which incorporates vision-language embeddings of foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS). The key contribution of this work is an efficient method to reconstruct and represent 3D vision-language models. This is achieved by distilling feature maps generated from image-based foundation models into those rendered from our 3D model. To ensure high-quality rendering and fast training, we introduce a novel scene representation by integrating strengths from both GS and multi-resolution hash encodings (MHE). Our effective training procedure also introduces a pixel alignment loss that makes the rendered feature distance of the same semantic entities close, following the pixel-level semantic boundaries. Our results demonstrate remarkable multi-view semantic consistency, facilitating diverse downstream tasks, beating state-of-the-art methods by 10.2 percent on open-vocabulary language-based object detection, despite that we are 851X faster for inference. This research explores the intersection of vision, language, and 3D scene representation, paving the way for enhanced scene understanding in uncontrolled real-world environments. We plan to release the code on the project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/fmgs</p></details> |
| **[Automating the Enterprise with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03710v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating enterprise workflows could unlock $4 trillion/year in productivity gains. Despite being of interest to the data management community for decades, the ultimate vision of end-to-end workflow automation has remained elusive. Current solutions rely on process mining and robotic process automation (RPA), in which a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of predefined rules for completing a workflow. Through case studies of a hospital and large B2B enterprise, we find that the adoption of RPA has been inhibited by high set-up costs (12-18 months), unreliable execution (60% initial accuracy), and burdensome maintenance (requiring multiple FTEs). Multimodal foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 offer a promising new approach for end-to-end workflow automation given their generalized reasoning and planning abilities. To study these capabilities we propose ECLAIR, a system to automate enterprise workflows with minimal human supervision. We conduct initial experiments showing that multimodal FMs can address the limitations of traditional RPA with (1) near-human-level understanding of workflows (93% accuracy on a workflow understanding task) and (2) instant set-up with minimal technical barrier (based solely on a natural language description of a workflow, ECLAIR achieves end-to-end completion rates of 40%). We identify human-AI collaboration, validation, and self-improvement as open challenges, and suggest ways they can be solved with data management techniques.

| **[Mapping the Unseen: Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping with Dynamic Labeling using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02162v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics and computer vision, efficient and accurate semantic mapping remains a significant challenge due to the growing demand for intelligent machines that can comprehend and interact with complex environments. Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing world models rely solely on statistical learning of how observations change in response to actions, lacking precise quantification of how accurate the surrogate dynamics are, which poses a significant challenge in safety-critical systems. To address this challenge, we propose foundation world models that embed observations into meaningful and causally latent representations. This enables the surrogate dynamics to directly predict causal future states by leveraging a training-free large language model. In two common benchmarks, this novel model outperforms standard world models in the safety prediction task and has a performance comparable to supervised learning despite not using any data. We evaluate its performance with a more specialized and system-relevant metric by comparing estimated states instead of aggregating observation-wide error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Back to the Future-Robot Learning Going Probabilistic Workshop, co-located with ICRA 2024. https://openreview.net/forum?id=gHhBNIq9Cs</p></details> |

In this position piece we aim to shift the ML research community's priorities ever so slightly to a different modality: tabular data. Tabular data is the dominant modality in many fields, yet it is given hardly any research attention and significantly lags behind in terms of scale and power. We believe the time is now to start developing tabular foundation models, or what we coin a Large Tabular Model (LTM). LTMs could revolutionise the way science and ML use tabular data: not as single datasets that are analyzed in a vacuum, but contextualized with respect to related datasets. The potential impact is far-reaching: from few-shot tabular models to automating data science; from out-of-distribution synthetic data to empowering multidisciplinary scientific discovery. We intend to excite reflections on the modalities we study, and convince some researchers to study large tabular models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

In the real world, spatial understanding is often an ill-posed problem. There are a number of powerful classical methods that accurately regress relative pose, however, these approaches often lack the ability to leverage data-derived priors to resolve ambiguities. In multi-robot systems, these challenges are exacerbated by the need for accurate and frequent position estimates of cooperating agents. To this end, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot, visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data. Unlike prior work evaluated primarily on offline datasets, we design our model specifically for online evaluation and real-world deployment on cooperative robots. Our model is completely decentralized, platform agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing network infrastructure. In this work, we focus on relative pose estimation and local Bird's Eye View (BEV) prediction tasks. Unlike classical approaches, we show that our model can accurately predict relative poses without requiring camera overlap, and predict BEVs of regions not visible to the ego-agent. We demonstrate our model on a multi-robot formation control task outside the confines of the laboratory.</p></details> |  |

Our paper introduces a new foundation model, nach0, capable of solving various chemical and biological tasks: biomedical question answering, named entity recognition, molecular generation, molecular synthesis, attributes prediction, and others. nach0 is a multi-domain and multi-task encoder-decoder LLM pre-trained on unlabeled text from scientific literature, patents, and molecule strings to incorporate a range of chemical and linguistic knowledge. We employed instruction tuning, where specific task-related instructions are utilized to fine-tune nach0 for the final set of tasks. To train nach0 effectively, we leverage the NeMo framework, enabling efficient parallel optimization of both base and large model versions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-domain and cross-domain tasks.

Inspired by human sensorimotor adaptation mechanisms, we aim to train encoder-decoder networks that can be commonly used to learn novel motor skills in a single movement category. To train the policy network, we develop the multitask reinforcement learning method, where the policy needs to cope with changes in goals or environments with different reward functions or physical parameters of the environment in dynamic movement generation tasks. Here, as a concrete task, we evaluated the proposed method with the ball heading task using a monopod robot model. The results showed that the proposed method could adapt to novel target positions or inexperienced ball restitution coefficients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the acquired foundational policy network originally learned for heading motion, can be used to generate an entirely new overhead kicking skill.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Ontologies are a well-known strategy for addressing such challenges, though given the complexity of the phenomenon, there are risks of reintroducing the interoperability challenges at the level of ontology representations. In the interest of avoiding such pitfalls, we introduce and defend characterizations of digital twins within the context of the Common Core Ontologies, an extension of the widely-used Basic Formal Ontology. We provide a set of definitions and design patterns relevant to the domain of digital twins, highlighted by illustrative use cases of digital twins and their physical counterparts. In doing so, we provide a foundation on which to build more sophisticated ontological content related and connected to digital twins.</p></details> | 14 |

VFMs like CLIP, DINOv2, SAM are trained with distinct objectives, exhibiting unique characteristics for various downstream tasks. We find that despite their conceptual differences, these models can be effectively merged into a unified model through multi-teacher distillation. We name this approach AM-RADIO (Agglomerative Model -- Reduce All Domains Into One). This integrative approach not only surpasses the performance of individual teacher models but also amalgamates their distinctive features, such as zero-shot vision-language comprehension, detailed pixel-level understanding, and open vocabulary segmentation capabilities. In pursuit of the most hardware-efficient backbone, we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation pipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel architecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at least 7x faster than the teacher models.

| **[Training a high-performance retinal foundation model with half-the-data and 400 times less compute](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00117v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence holds tremendous potential in medicine, but is traditionally limited by the lack of massive datasets to train models on. Foundation models, pre-trained models that can be adapted to downstream tasks with small datasets, could alleviate this problem. Researchers at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) proposed RETFound-MEH, a foundation model for retinal imaging that was trained on 900,000 images, including private hospital data. Recently, data-efficient DERETFound was proposed that provides comparable performance while being trained on only 150,000 images that are all publicly available. However, both these models required very substantial resources to train initially and are resource-intensive in downstream use. We propose a novel Token Reconstruction objective that we use to train RETFound-Green, a retinal foundation model trained using only 75,000 publicly available images and 400 times less compute. We estimate the cost of training RETFound-MEH and DERETFound at $10,000 and $14,000, respectively, while RETFound-Green could be trained for less than $100, with equally reduced environmental impact. RETFound-Green is also far more efficient in downstream use: it can be downloaded 14 times faster, computes vector embeddings 2.7 times faster which then require 2.6 times less storage space. Despite this, RETFound-Green does not perform systematically worse. In fact, it performs best on 14 tasks, compared to six for DERETFound and two for RETFound-MEH. Our results suggest that RETFound-Green is a very efficient, high-performance retinal foundation model. We anticipate that our Token Reconstruction objective could be scaled up for even higher performance and be applied to other domains beyond retinal imaging.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we compare the performance of a foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a baseline Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model for missing value imputation in time series of multispectral satellite imagery. We randomly mask time series of satellite images using real-world cloud masks and train each model to reconstruct the missing pixels. The ViT model is fine-tuned from a pretrained model, while the CGAN is trained from scratch. Using quantitative evaluation metrics such as structural similarity index and mean absolute error as well as qualitative visual analysis, we assess imputation accuracy and contextual preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Essential Role of Causality in Foundation World Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06665v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models, especially in large multi-modal models and conversational agents, have ignited interest in the potential of generally capable embodied agents. Such agents will require the ability to perform new tasks in many different real-world environments. However, current foundation models fail to accurately model physical interactions and are therefore insufficient for Embodied AI. The study of causality lends itself to the construction of veridical world models, which are crucial for accurately predicting the outcomes of possible interactions. This paper focuses on the prospects of building foundation world models for the upcoming generation of embodied agents and presents a novel viewpoint on the significance of causality within these. We posit that integrating causal considerations is vital to facilitating meaningful physical interactions with the world. Finally, we demystify misconceptions about causality in this context and present our outlook for future research.</p></details> |  |

By synthesizing a range of theoretical frameworks and application domains, this thesis aims to advance the machine learning foundations of multisensory AI. In the first part, we present a theoretical framework formalizing how modalities interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets, design principled approaches to learn these interactions, and analyze whether their model has succeeded in learning. In the second part, we study the design of practical multimodal foundation models that generalize over many modalities and tasks, which presents a step toward grounding large language models to real-world sensory modalities. We introduce MultiBench, a unified large-scale benchmark across a wide range of modalities, tasks, and research areas, followed by the cross-modal attention and multimodal transformer architectures that now underpin many of today's multimodal foundation models. Scaling these architectures on MultiBench enables the creation of general-purpose multisensory AI systems, and we discuss our collaborative efforts in applying these models for real-world impact in affective computing, mental health, cancer prognosis, and robotics. Finally, we conclude this thesis by discussing how future work can leverage these ideas toward more general, interactive, and safe multisensory AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>CMU M...</summary><p>CMU Machine Learning Department PhD Thesis</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel system that combines the Segment Anything model (SAM) -- a transformer-based visual foundation model -- with a robotic arm on a mobile platform. The design of integrating a depth camera on the robotic arm's end-effector ensures continuous object tracking, significantly mitigating environmental uncertainties. By deploying on a mobile platform, our grasping system has an enhanced mobility, playing a key role in dynamic environments where adaptability are critical. This synthesis enables dynamic object segmentation, tracking, and grasping. It also elevates user interaction, allowing the robot to intuitively respond to various modalities such as clicks, drawings, or voice commands, beyond traditional robotic systems. Empirical assessments in both simulated and real-world demonstrate the system's capabilities.

In contrast to STL, MTL offers a suite of benefits that enhance both the training process and the inference efficiency. MTL's key advantages encompass streamlined model architecture, performance enhancement, and cross-domain generalizability. Over the past twenty years, MTL has become widely recognized as a flexible and effective approach in various fields, including CV, NLP, recommendation systems, disease prognosis and diagnosis, and robotics. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of MTL, encompassing the technical aspects of cutting-edge methods from traditional approaches to deep learning and the latest trend of pretrained foundation models. Our survey methodically categorizes MTL techniques into five key areas: regularization, relationship learning, feature propagation, optimization, and pre-training. This categorization not only chronologically outlines the development of MTL but also dives into various specialized strategies within each category. Furthermore, the survey reveals how the MTL evolves from handling a fixed set of tasks to embracing a more flexible approach free from task or modality constraints. It explores the concepts of task-promptable and -agnostic training, along with the capacity for ZSL, which unleashes the untapped potential of this historically coveted learning paradigm.

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Federated Proxy Fine-Tuning (FedPFT), a novel method enhancing FMs adaptation in downstream tasks through FL by two key modules. First, the sub-FM construction module employs a layer-wise compression approach, facilitating comprehensive FM fine-tuning across all layers by emphasizing those crucial neurons. Second, the sub-FM alignment module conducts a two-step distillations-layer-level and neuron-level-before and during FL fine-tuning respectively, to reduce error of gradient by accurately aligning sub-FM with FM under theoretical guarantees. Experimental results on seven commonly used datasets (i.e., four text and three vision) demonstrate the superiority of FedPFT.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI'24 |

Specifically, we formulate the video-based PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and adopt a pre-trained foundation model CLIP to extract the visual features. More importantly, we propose a novel spatiotemporal side-tuning strategy to achieve parameter-efficient optimization of the pre-trained vision foundation model. To better utilize the semantic information, we take the full attribute list that needs to be recognized as another input and transform the attribute words/phrases into the corresponding sentence via split, expand, and prompt operations. Then, the text encoder of CLIP is utilized for embedding processed attribute descriptions. The averaged visual tokens and text tokens are concatenated and fed into a fusion Transformer for multi-modal interactive learning. The enhanced tokens will be fed into a classification head for pedestrian attribute prediction. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video-based PAR datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

However, large foundation models are typically trained on high-quality data, which poses a significant challenge, given the prevalence of poor-quality real-world data. This challenge is more pronounced for developing foundation models for physiological data; such data are often noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent. The present work aims to provide a toolset for developing foundation models on physiological data. We leverage a large dataset of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals from hospitalized intensive care patients. For this data, we propose SimQuality, a novel self-supervised learning task based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbone to enforce representations to be similar for good and poor quality signals that are from similar physiological states. We pre-trained the SimQuality on over 36 million 30-second PPG pairs and then fine-tuned and tested on six downstream tasks using external datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on all the downstream tasks, which are extremely important for heart monitoring on wearable devices. Our method indicates that CNNs can be an effective backbone for foundation models that are robust to training data quality.</p></details> |  |

These ``foundation'' models are often adapted to a variety of downstream tasks like classification, object detection, and segmentation with little-to-no training on the target dataset. In this work, we perform a robustness analysis of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for segmentation tasks and focus on robustness against real-world distribution shift inspired perturbations. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 2 different perturbed datasets, MS COCO-P and ADE20K-P, with 17 different perturbations with 5 severity levels each. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) VFMs exhibit vulnerabilities to compression-induced corruptions, (2) despite not outpacing all of unimodal models in robustness, multimodal models show competitive resilience in zero-shot scenarios, and (3) VFMs demonstrate enhanced robustness for certain object categories. These observations suggest that our robustness evaluation framework sets new requirements for foundational models, encouraging further advancements to bolster their adaptability and performance.

However, some studies have shown that although foundation models exhibit strong general feature extraction capabilities, their performance on specific tasks is still inferior to task-specific methods. In this paper, we explore a new perspective called ``Knowledge Decomposition'' to improve the performance on specific medical tasks, which deconstruct the foundation model into multiple lightweight expert models, each dedicated to a particular task, with the goal of improving specialization while concurrently mitigating resource expenditure. To accomplish the above objective, we design a novel framework named Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition (LoRKD), which explicitly separates graidents by incorporating low-rank expert modules and the efficient knowledge separation convolution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the decomposed models perform well in terms of performance and transferability, even surpassing the original foundation models.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
