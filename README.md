| **[Where Am I and What Will I See: An Auto-Regressive Model for Spatial Localization and View Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18962v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial intelligence is the ability of a machine to perceive, reason, and act in three dimensions within space and time. Recent advancements in large-scale auto-regressive models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various reasoning tasks. However, these models often struggle with fundamental aspects of spatial reasoning, particularly in answering questions like "Where am I?" and "What will I see?". While some attempts have been done, existing approaches typically treat them as separate tasks, failing to capture their interconnected nature. In this paper, we present Generative Spatial Transformer (GST), a novel auto-regressive framework that jointly addresses spatial localization and view prediction. Our model simultaneously estimates the camera pose from a single image and predicts the view from a new camera pose, effectively bridging the gap between spatial awareness and visual prediction. The proposed innovative camera tokenization method enables the model to learn the joint distribution of 2D projections and their corresponding spatial perspectives in an auto-regressive manner. This unified training paradigm demonstrates that joint optimization of pose estimation and novel view synthesis leads to improved performance in both tasks, for the first time, highlighting the inherent relationship between spatial awareness and visual prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Spatial Model: End-to-end Unposed Images to Semantic 3D](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18956v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing and understanding 3D structures from a limited number of images is a well-established problem in computer vision. Traditional methods usually break this task into multiple subtasks, each requiring complex transformations between different data representations. For instance, dense reconstruction through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) involves converting images into key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures. Afterward, accurate sparse reconstructions are required for further dense modeling, which is subsequently fed into task-specific neural networks. This multi-step process results in considerable processing time and increased engineering complexity. In this work, we present the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which processes unposed RGB images directly into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneously estimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward operation, and it can generate versatile label maps by interacting with language at novel viewpoints. Leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, LSM integrates global geometry through pixel-aligned point maps. To enhance spatial attribute regression, we incorporate local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, improving the accuracy of fine local details. To tackle the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field. An efficient decoder then parameterizes a set of semantic anisotropic Gaussians, facilitating supervised end-to-end learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that LSM unifies multiple 3D vision tasks directly from unposed images, achieving real-time semantic 3D reconstruction for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://largespatialmodel.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Diffusion: Enhancing Spatial Layout in High-Resolution Panoramic Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18830v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently gained recognition for generating diverse and high-quality content, especially in the domain of image synthesis. These models excel not only in creating fixed-size images but also in producing panoramic images. However, existing methods often struggle with spatial layout consistency when producing high-resolution panoramas, due to the lack of guidance of the global image layout. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Scale Diffusion (MSD) framework, a plug-and-play module that extends the existing panoramic image generation framework to multiple resolution levels. By utilizing gradient descent techniques, our method effectively incorporates structural information from low-resolution images into high-resolution outputs. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method was conducted, comparing it with the prior works in qualitative and quantitative dimensions. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms others in generating coherent high-resolution panoramas.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Nonparametric Clustering Stopping Rule Based on Spatial Median](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18730v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a nonparametric clustering stopping rule algorithm based on the spatial median. Our proposed method aims to achieve the balance between the homogeneity within the clusters and the heterogeneity between clusters. The proposed algorithm maximises the ratio of the variation between clusters and the variation within clusters while adjusting for the number of clusters and number of observations. The proposed algorithm is robust against distributional assumptions and the presence of outliers. Simulations have been used to validate the algorithm. We further evaluated the stability and the efficacy of the proposed algorithm using three real-world datasets. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model with 13 other traditional algorithms for determining the number of clusters. We found that the proposed algorithm outperformed 11 of the algorithms considered for comparison in terms of clustering number determination. The finding demonstrates that the proposed method provides a reliable alternative to determine the number of clusters for multivariate data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Search for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18580v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs achieve competitive performances on benchmark tasks like image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not optimal for SNNs. In this work, we apply Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find suitable architectures for SNNs. Previous NAS methods for SNNs focus primarily on the spatial dimension, with a notable lack of consideration for the temporal dynamics that are of critical importance for SNNs. Drawing inspiration from the heterogeneity of biological neural networks, we propose a differentiable approach to optimize SNN on both spatial and temporal dimensions. At spatial level, we have developed a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based operation is optimized on both the cell and the layer level under computational constraints. We further propose a differentiable surrogate gradient search (DGS) method to evolve local SG functions independently during training. At temporal level, we explore an optimal configuration of diverse temporal dynamics on different types of spiking neurons by evolving their time constants, based on which we further develop hybrid networks combining SNN and ANN, balancing both accuracy and efficiency. Our methods achieve comparable classification performance of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracies of 96.43%, 78.96%, and 70.21%, respectively. On event-based deep stereo, our methods find optimal layer variation and surpass the accuracy of specially designed ANNs with 26$\times$ lower computational cost ($6.7\mathrm{mJ}$), demonstrating the potential of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[DN-4DGS: Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13607v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scenes rendering is an intriguing yet challenging problem. Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real-time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. However, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we propose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Geometric Feature Enhanced Knowledge Graph Embedding and Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18345v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial Knowledge Graphs (GeoKGs) model geoentities (e.g., places and natural features) and spatial relationships in an interconnected manner, providing strong knowledge support for geographic applications, including data retrieval, question-answering, and spatial reasoning. However, existing methods for mining and reasoning from GeoKGs, such as popular knowledge graph embedding (KGE) techniques, lack geographic awareness. This study aims to enhance general-purpose KGE by developing new strategies and integrating geometric features of spatial relations, including topology, direction, and distance, to infuse the embedding process with geographic intuition. The new model is tested on downstream link prediction tasks, and the results show that the inclusion of geometric features, particularly topology and direction, improves prediction accuracy for both geoentities and spatial relations. Our research offers new perspectives for integrating spatial concepts and principles into the GeoKG mining process, providing customized GeoAI solutions for geospatial challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 1 figure, Accepted for the 7th ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on AI for Geographic Knowledge Discovery</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Spatial Outliers: the Role of the Local Influence Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18261v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the analysis of large spatial datasets, identifying and treating spatial outliers is essential for accurately interpreting geographical phenomena. While spatial correlation measures, particularly Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), are widely used to detect spatial patterns, the presence of abnormal observations frequently distorts the landscape and conceals critical spatial relationships. These outliers can significantly impact analysis due to the inherent spatial dependencies present in the data. Traditional influence function (IF) methodologies, commonly used in statistical analysis to measure the impact of individual observations, are not directly applicable in the spatial context because the influence of an observation is determined not only by its own value but also by its spatial location, its connections with neighboring regions, and the values of those neighboring observations. In this paper, we introduce a local version of the influence function (LIF) that accounts for these spatial dependencies. Through the analysis of both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrate how the LIF provides a more nuanced and accurate detection of spatial outliers compared to traditional LISA measures and local impact assessments, improving our understanding of spatial patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A utility-based spatial analysis of residential street-level conditions; A case study of Rotterdam](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17880v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Residential location choices are traditionally modelled using factors related to accessibility and socioeconomic environments, neglecting the importance of local street-level conditions. Arguably, this neglect is due to data practices. Today, however, street-level images -- which are highly effective at encoding street-level conditions -- are widely available. Additionally, recent advances in discrete choice models incorporating computer vision capabilities offer opportunities to integrate street-level conditions into residential location choice analysis. This study leverages these developments to investigate the spatial distribution of utility derived from street-level conditions in residential location choices on a city-wide scale. In our case study of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, we find that the utility derived from street-level conditions varies significantly on a highly localised scale, with conditions rapidly changing even within neighbourhoods. Our results also reveal that the high real-estate prices in the city centre cannot be attributed to attractive street-level conditions. Furthermore, whereas the city centre is characterised by relatively unattractive residential street-level conditions, neighbourhoods in the southern part of the city -- often perceived as problematic -- exhibit surprisingly appealing street-level environments. The methodological contribution of this paper is that it advances the discrete choice models incorporating computer vision capabilities by introducing a semantic regularisation layer to the model. Thereby, it adds explainability and eliminates the need for a separate pipeline to extract information from images, streamlining the analysis. As such, this paper's findings and methodological advancements pave the way for further studies to explore integrating street-level conditions in urban planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[CASCRNet: An Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and Shared Channel Residual based Network for Capsule Endoscopy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17863v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This manuscript summarizes work on the Capsule Vision Challenge 2024 by MISAHUB. To address the multi-class disease classification task, which is challenging due to the complexity and imbalance in the Capsule Vision challenge dataset, this paper proposes CASCRNet (Capsule endoscopy-Aspp-SCR-Network), a parameter-efficient and novel model that uses Shared Channel Residual (SCR) blocks and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) blocks. Further, the performance of the proposed model is compared with other well-known approaches. The experimental results yield that proposed model provides better disease classification results. The proposed model was successful in classifying diseases with an F1 Score of 78.5% and a Mean AUC of 98.3%, which is promising given its compact architecture.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Mind's Eye of LLMs: Visualization-of-Thought Elicits Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03622v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in language comprehension and various reasoning tasks. However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs. Please find the dataset and codes at https://microsoft.github.io/visualization-of-thought</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Hybrid Spatial Representations for Species Distribution Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10937v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address an important problem in ecology called Species Distribution Modeling (SDM), whose goal is to predict whether a species exists at a certain position on Earth. In particular, we tackle a challenging version of this task, where we learn from presence-only data in a community-sourced dataset, model a large number of species simultaneously, and do not use any additional environmental information. Previous work has used neural implicit representations to construct models that achieve promising results. However, implicit representations often generate predictions of limited spatial precision. We attribute this limitation to their inherently global formulation and inability to effectively capture local feature variations. This issue is especially pronounced with presence-only data and a large number of species. To address this, we propose a hybrid embedding scheme that combines both implicit and explicit embeddings. Specifically, the explicit embedding is implemented with a multiresolution hashgrid, enabling our models to better capture local information. Experiments demonstrate that our results exceed other works by a large margin on various standard benchmarks, and that the hybrid representation is better than both purely implicit and explicit ones. Qualitative visualizations and comprehensive ablation studies reveal that our hybrid representation successfully addresses the two main challenges. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/Shiran-Yuan/HSR-SDM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project codebase https://github.com/Shiran-Yuan/HSR-SDM</p></details> |
| **[Do Vision-Language Models Represent Space and How? Evaluating Spatial Frame of Reference Under Ambiguities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17385v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial expressions in situated communication can be ambiguous, as their meanings vary depending on the frames of reference (FoR) adopted by speakers and listeners. While spatial language understanding and reasoning by vision-language models (VLMs) have gained increasing attention, potential ambiguities in these models are still under-explored. To address this issue, we present the COnsistent Multilingual Frame Of Reference Test (COMFORT), an evaluation protocol to systematically assess the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs using COMFORT. Despite showing some alignment with English conventions in resolving ambiguities, our experiments reveal significant shortcomings of VLMs: notably, the models (1) exhibit poor robustness and consistency, (2) lack the flexibility to accommodate multiple FoRs, and (3) fail to adhere to language-specific or culture-specific conventions in cross-lingual tests, as English tends to dominate other languages. With a growing effort to align vision-language models with human cognitive intuitions, we call for more attention to the ambiguous nature and cross-cultural diversity of spatial reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Pluralistic Alignment @ NeurIPS 2024 | Project page: https://spatial-comfort.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12961v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously. Our work is open-sourced at https://github.com/Oryx-mllm/Oryx.</p></details> |  |
| **[ISImed: A Framework for Self-Supervised Learning using Intrinsic Spatial Information in Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16947v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper demonstrates that spatial information can be used to learn interpretable representations in medical images using Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our proposed method, ISImed, is based on the observation that medical images exhibit a much lower variability among different images compared to classic data vision benchmarks. By leveraging this resemblance of human body structures across multiple images, we establish a self-supervised objective that creates a latent representation capable of capturing its location in the physical realm. More specifically, our method involves sampling image crops and creating a distance matrix that compares the learned representation vectors of all possible combinations of these crops to the true distance between them. The intuition is, that the learned latent space is a positional encoding for a given image crop. We hypothesize, that by learning these positional encodings, comprehensive image representations have to be generated. To test this hypothesis and evaluate our method, we compare our learned representation with two state-of-the-art SSL benchmarking methods on two publicly available medical imaging datasets. We show that our method can efficiently learn representations that capture the underlying structure of the data and can be used to transfer to a downstream classification task.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Despite the growing interest in analysing such complex event patterns, the methodology for such analysis is not embedded well in the literature. In particular, the literature lacks statistical methods to analyse marks which are characterised by an inherent relational structure, i.e.\ where the mark is graph-valued. Motivated by epidermal nerve fibre data, we introduce different mark summary characteristics, which investigate the average variation or association between pairs of graph-valued marks, and apply some of the methods to the nerve data.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Bridging the Modality Gap: Dimension Information Alignment and Sparse Spatial Constraint for Image-Text Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16853v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many contrastive learning based models have achieved advanced performance in image-text matching tasks. The key of these models lies in analyzing the correlation between image-text pairs, which involves cross-modal interaction of embeddings in corresponding dimensions. However, the embeddings of different modalities are from different models or modules, and there is a significant modality gap. Directly interacting such embeddings lacks rationality and may capture inaccurate correlation. Therefore, we propose a novel method called DIAS to bridge the modality gap from two aspects: (1) We align the information representation of embeddings from different modalities in corresponding dimension to ensure the correlation calculation is based on interactions of similar information. (2) The spatial constraints of inter- and intra-modalities unmatched pairs are introduced to ensure the effectiveness of semantic alignment of the model. Besides, a sparse correlation algorithm is proposed to select strong correlated spatial relationships, enabling the model to learn more significant features and avoid being misled by weak correlation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DIAS, achieving 4.3\%-10.2\% rSum improvements on Flickr30k and MSCOCO benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting the Generalization Ability for Hyperspectral Image Classification using Spectral-spatial Axial Aggregation Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16759v3)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the hyperspectral image classification (HSIC) task, the most commonly used model validation paradigm is partitioning the training-test dataset through pixel-wise random sampling. By training on a small amount of data, the deep learning model can achieve almost perfect accuracy. However, in our experiments, we found that the high accuracy was reached because the training and test datasets share a lot of information. On non-overlapping dataset partitions, well-performing models suffer significant performance degradation. To this end, we propose a spectral-spatial axial aggregation transformer model, namely SaaFormer, that preserves generalization across dataset partitions. SaaFormer applies a multi-level spectral extraction structure to segment the spectrum into multiple spectrum clips, such that the wavelength continuity of the spectrum across the channel are preserved. For each spectrum clip, the axial aggregation attention mechanism, which integrates spatial features along multiple spectral axes is applied to mine the spectral characteristic. The multi-level spectral extraction and the axial aggregation attention emphasize spectral characteristic to improve the model generalization. The experimental results on five publicly available datasets demonstrate that our model exhibits comparable performance on the random partition, while significantly outperforming other methods on non-overlapping partitions. Moreover, SaaFormer shows excellent performance on background classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2107.02988 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[A class of modular and flexible covariate-based covariance functions for nonstationary spatial modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16716v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The assumptions of stationarity and isotropy often stated over spatial processes have not aged well during the last two decades, partly explained by the combination of computational developments and the increasing availability of high-resolution spatial data. While a plethora of approaches have been developed to relax these assumptions, it is often a costly tradeoff between flexibility and a diversity of computational challenges. In this paper, we present a class of covariance functions that relies on fixed, observable spatial information that provides a convenient tradeoff while offering an extra layer of numerical and visual representation of the flexible spatial dependencies. This model allows for separate parametric structures for different sources of nonstationarity, such as marginal standard deviation, geometric anisotropy, and smoothness. It simplifies to a Mat\'ern covariance function in its basic form and is adaptable for large datasets, enhancing flexibility and computational efficiency. We analyze the capabilities of the presented model through simulation studies and an application to Swiss precipitation data.</p></details> | 24 pages, 12 figures |
| **[TIPS: Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial Awareness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16512v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While image-text representation learning has become very popular in recent years, existing models tend to lack spatial awareness and have limited direct applicability for dense understanding tasks. For this reason, self-supervised image-only pretraining is still the go-to method for many dense vision applications (e.g. depth estimation, semantic segmentation), despite the lack of explicit supervisory signals. In this paper, we close this gap between image-text and self-supervised learning, by proposing a novel general-purpose image-text model, which can be effectively used off-the-shelf for dense and global vision tasks. Our method, which we refer to as Text-Image Pretraining with Spatial awareness (TIPS), leverages two simple and effective insights. First, on textual supervision: we reveal that replacing noisy web image captions by synthetically generated textual descriptions boosts dense understanding performance significantly, due to a much richer signal for learning spatially aware representations. We propose an adapted training method that combines noisy and synthetic captions, resulting in improvements across both dense and global understanding tasks. Second, on the learning technique: we propose to combine contrastive image-text learning with self-supervised masked image modeling, to encourage spatial coherence, unlocking substantial enhancements for downstream applications. Building on these two ideas, we scale our model using the transformer architecture, trained on a curated set of public images. Our experiments are conducted on 8 tasks involving 16 datasets in total, demonstrating strong off-the-shelf performance on both dense and global understanding, for several image-only and image-text tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparkle: Mastering Basic Spatial Capabilities in Vision Language Models Elicits Generalization to Composite Spatial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16162v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models (VLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across a wide range of downstream tasks. However, their proficiency in spatial reasoning remains limited, despite its crucial role in tasks involving navigation and interaction with physical environments. Specifically, much of the spatial reasoning in these tasks occurs in two-dimensional (2D) environments, and our evaluation reveals that state-of-the-art VLMs frequently generate implausible and incorrect responses to composite spatial reasoning problems, including simple pathfinding tasks that humans can solve effortlessly at a glance. To address this, we explore an effective approach to enhance 2D spatial reasoning within VLMs by training the model on basic spatial capabilities. We begin by disentangling the key components of 2D spatial reasoning: direction comprehension, distance estimation, and localization. Our central hypothesis is that mastering these basic spatial capabilities can significantly enhance a model's performance on composite spatial tasks requiring advanced spatial understanding and combinatorial problem-solving. To investigate this hypothesis, we introduce Sparkle, a framework that fine-tunes VLMs on these three basic spatial capabilities by synthetic data generation and targeted supervision to form an instruction dataset for each capability. Our experiments demonstrate that VLMs fine-tuned with Sparkle achieve significant performance gains, not only in the basic tasks themselves but also in generalizing to composite and out-of-distribution spatial reasoning tasks (e.g., improving from 13.5% to 40.0% on the shortest path problem). These findings underscore the effectiveness of mastering basic spatial capabilities in enhancing composite spatial problem-solving, offering insights for improving VLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[AROMA: Preserving Spatial Structure for Latent PDE Modeling with Local Neural Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02176v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AROMA (Attentive Reduced Order Model with Attention), a framework designed to enhance the modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs) using local neural fields. Our flexible encoder-decoder architecture can obtain smooth latent representations of spatial physical fields from a variety of data types, including irregular-grid inputs and point clouds. This versatility eliminates the need for patching and allows efficient processing of diverse geometries. The sequential nature of our latent representation can be interpreted spatially and permits the use of a conditional transformer for modeling the temporal dynamics of PDEs. By employing a diffusion-based formulation, we achieve greater stability and enable longer rollouts compared to conventional MSE training. AROMA's superior performance in simulating 1D and 2D equations underscores the efficacy of our approach in capturing complex dynamical behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Architecture for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection: Integrating Spatial and Temporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15909v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior by combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences. Regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analyses, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. In this article, we will compare these two architectural configurations with each other, to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disambiguating Monocular Reconstruction of 3D Clothed Human with Spatial-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16337v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from monocular camera data is highly challenging due to viewpoint limitations and image ambiguity. While implicit function-based approaches, combined with prior knowledge from parametric models, have made significant progress, there are still two notable problems. Firstly, the back details of human models are ambiguous due to viewpoint invisibility. The quality of the back details depends on the back normal map predicted by a convolutional neural network (CNN). However, the CNN lacks global information awareness for comprehending the back texture, resulting in excessively smooth back details. Secondly, a single image suffers from local ambiguity due to lighting conditions and body movement. However, implicit functions are highly sensitive to pixel variations in ambiguous regions. To address these ambiguities, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Transformer (STT) network for 3D clothed human reconstruction. A spatial transformer is employed to extract global information for normal map prediction. The establishment of global correlations facilitates the network in comprehending the holistic texture and shape of the human body. Simultaneously, to compensate for local ambiguity in images, a temporal transformer is utilized to extract temporal features from adjacent frames. The incorporation of temporal features can enhance the accuracy of input features in implicit networks. Furthermore, to obtain more accurate temporal features, joint tokens are employed to establish local correspondences between frames. Experimental results on the Adobe and MonoPerfCap datasets have shown that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and maintains robust generalization even under low-light outdoor conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Graph Reinforcement Learning for Dependency-aware Multi-task Allocation in Spatial Crowdsourcing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15449v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Crowdsourcing (SC) is gaining traction in both academia and industry, with tasks on SC platforms becoming increasingly complex and requiring collaboration among workers with diverse skills. Recent research works address complex tasks by dividing them into subtasks with dependencies and assigning them to suitable workers. However, the dependencies among subtasks and their heterogeneous skill requirements, as well as the need for efficient utilization of workers' limited work time in the multi-task allocation mode, pose challenges in achieving an optimal task allocation scheme. Therefore, this paper formally investigates the problem of Dependency-aware Multi-task Allocation (DMA) and presents a well-designed framework to solve it, known as Heterogeneous Graph Reinforcement Learning-based Task Allocation (HGRL-TA). To address the challenges associated with representing and embedding diverse problem instances to ensure robust generalization, we propose a multi-relation graph model and a Compound-path-based Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (CHANet) for effectively representing and capturing intricate relations among tasks and workers, as well as providing embedding of problem state. The task allocation decision is determined sequentially by a policy network, which undergoes simultaneous training with CHANet using the proximal policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed HGRL-TA in solving the DMA problem, leading to average profits that is 21.78% higher than those achieved using the metaheuristic methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synergistic Dual Spatial-aware Generation of Image-to-Text and Text-to-Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15312v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the visual spatial understanding (VSU) area, spatial image-to-text (SI2T) and spatial text-to-image (ST2I) are two fundamental tasks that appear in dual form. Existing methods for standalone SI2T or ST2I perform imperfectly in spatial understanding, due to the difficulty of 3D-wise spatial feature modeling. In this work, we consider modeling the SI2T and ST2I together under a dual learning framework. During the dual framework, we then propose to represent the 3D spatial scene features with a novel 3D scene graph (3DSG) representation that can be shared and beneficial to both tasks. Further, inspired by the intuition that the easier 3D$\to$image and 3D$\to$text processes also exist symmetrically in the ST2I and SI2T, respectively, we propose the Spatial Dual Discrete Diffusion (SD$^3$) framework, which utilizes the intermediate features of the 3D$\to$X processes to guide the hard X$\to$3D processes, such that the overall ST2I and SI2T will benefit each other. On the visual spatial understanding dataset VSD, our system outperforms the mainstream T2I and I2T methods significantly. Further in-depth analysis reveals how our dual learning strategy advances.</p></details> |  |

ImmerseDiffusion is trained to generate first-order ambisonics (FOA) audio, which is a conventional spatial audio format comprising four channels that can be rendered to multichannel spatial output. The proposed generative system is composed of a spatial audio codec that maps FOA audio to latent components, a latent diffusion model trained based on various user input types, namely, text prompts, spatial, temporal and environmental acoustic parameters, and optionally a spatial audio and text encoder trained in a Contrastive Language and Audio Pretraining (CLAP) style. We propose metrics to evaluate the quality and spatial adherence of the generated spatial audio. Finally, we assess the model performance in terms of generation quality and spatial conformance, comparing the two proposed modes: ``descriptive", which uses spatial text prompts) and ``parametric", which uses non-spatial text prompts and spatial parameters. Our evaluations demonstrate promising results that are consistent with the user conditions and reflect reliable spatial fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work pioneers a Latent Diffusion Model for generating text-prompted ambisonic spatial audio</p></details> |

The procedure of automatically extracting roads from satellite imagery encounters significant challenges due to the multi-scale and diverse structures of roads; improvement in this field is needed. The DeepLab series, known for its proficiency in semantic segmentation due to its efficiency in interpreting multi-scale objects' features, addresses some of these challenges caused by the varying nature of roads. The present work proposes the utilization of DeepLabV3+, the latest version of the DeepLab series, by introducing an innovative Dense Depthwise Dilated Separable Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DenseDDSSPP) module and integrating it in place of the conventional Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) module. This modification enhances the extraction of complex road structures from satellite images. This study hypothesizes that the integration of DenseDDSSPP, combined with an appropriately selected backbone network and a Squeeze-and-Excitation block, will generate an efficient dense feature map by focusing on relevant features, leading to more precise and accurate road extraction from Remote Sensing images. The results section presents a comparison of our model's performance against state-of-the-art models, demonstrating better results that highlight the effectiveness and success of the proposed approach.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

The available data are extremely large, making uncertainty quantification in a fully Bayesian framework quite difficult, as traditional implementations do not scale reasonably to the size of the data. We specifically consider roughly 8 million observations obtained from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. To analyze data on this scale, we introduce Scalable Multivariate Exact Posterior Regression (SM-EPR) which combines the recently introduced data subset approach and Exact Posterior Regression (EPR). EPR is a new Bayesian hierarchical model where it is possible to sample independent replicates of fixed and random effects directly from the posterior without the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or approximate Bayesian techniques. We extend EPR to the multivariate spatial context, where the multiple variables may be distributed according to different distributions. The combination of the data subset approach with EPR allows one to perform exact Bayesian inference without MCMC for effectively any sample size. We demonstrate our new SM-EPR method using this motivating big remote sensing data application and provide several simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Optimality-Aware Stochastic LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14565v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale LiDAR Bundle Adjustment (LBA) for refining sensor orientation and point cloud accuracy simultaneously is a fundamental task in photogrammetry and robotics, particularly as low-cost 3D sensors are increasingly used for 3D mapping in complex scenes. Unlike pose-graph-based methods that rely solely on pairwise relationships between LiDAR frames, LBA leverages raw LiDAR correspondences to achieve more precise results, especially when initial pose estimates are unreliable for low-cost sensors. However, existing LBA methods face challenges such as simplistic planar correspondences, extensive observations, and dense normal matrices in the least-squares problem, which limit robustness, efficiency, and scalability. To address these issues, we propose a Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization scheme with Progressive Spatial Smoothing, namely PSS-GOSO, to achieve \textit{robust}, \textit{efficient}, and \textit{scalable} LBA. The Progressive Spatial Smoothing (PSS) module extracts \textit{robust} LiDAR feature association exploiting the prior structure information obtained by the polynomial smooth kernel. The Graph Optimality-aware Stochastic Optimization (GOSO) module first sparsifies the graph according to optimality for an \textit{efficient} optimization. GOSO then utilizes stochastic clustering and graph marginalization to solve the large-scale state estimation problem for a \textit{scalable} LBA. We validate PSS-GOSO across diverse scenes captured by various platforms, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[PredFormer: Transformers Are Effective Spatial-Temporal Predictive Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04733v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal predictive learning methods generally fall into two categories: recurrent-based approaches, which face challenges in parallelization and performance, and recurrent-free methods, which employ convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as encoder-decoder architectures. These methods benefit from strong inductive biases but often at the expense of scalability and generalization. This paper proposes PredFormer, a pure transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal predictive learning. Motivated by the Vision Transformers (ViT) design, PredFormer leverages carefully designed Gated Transformer blocks, following a comprehensive analysis of 3D attention mechanisms, including full-, factorized-, and interleaved-spatial-temporal attention. With its recurrent-free, transformer-based design, PredFormer is both simple and efficient, significantly outperforming previous methods by large margins. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PredFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. On Moving MNIST, PredFormer achieves a 51.3% reduction in MSE relative to SimVP. For TaxiBJ, the model decreases MSE by 33.1% and boosts FPS from 533 to 2364. Additionally, on WeatherBench, it reduces MSE by 11.1% while enhancing FPS from 196 to 404. These performance gains in both accuracy and efficiency demonstrate PredFormer's potential for real-world applications. The source code will be released at https://github.com/yyyujintang/PredFormer .</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Previous research focused on the RGB modality for global environmental modeling, overlooking the potential of multi-source spatial knowledge like depth, speaker position, and environmental semantics. To address the issues, we propose a novel multi-source spatial knowledge understanding scheme for immersive VTTS, termed MS$^2$KU-VTTS. Specifically, we first prioritize RGB image as the dominant source and consider depth image, speaker position knowledge from object detection, and semantic captions from image understanding LLM as supplementary sources. Afterwards, we propose a serial interaction mechanism to deeply engage with both dominant and supplementary sources. The resulting multi-source knowledge is dynamically integrated based on their contributions.This enriched interaction and integration of multi-source spatial knowledge guides the speech generation model, enhancing the immersive spatial speech experience.Experimental results demonstrate that the MS$^2$KU-VTTS surpasses existing baselines in generating immersive speech.

Our methodology integrates the Mixture-of-Experts architecture with BERT model to capture complex mobility dynamics and perform the downstream human mobility prediction task. Additionally, transfer learning is integrated to solve the challenge of data scarcity in cross-city prediction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model on GEO-BLEU and DTW, comparing it to several state-of-the-art methods.

SDBMSs are employed in various modern applications, such as geographic information systems, computer-aided design tools, and location-based services. However, the presence of logic bugs in SDBMSs can lead to incorrect results, substantially undermining the reliability of these applications. Detecting logic bugs in SDBMSs is challenging due to the lack of ground truth for identifying incorrect results. In this paper, we propose an automated geometry-aware generator to generate high-quality SQL statements for SDBMSs and a novel concept named Affine Equivalent Inputs (AEI) to validate the results of SDBMSs. We implemented them as a tool named Spatter (Spatial DBMSs Tester) for finding logic bugs in four popular SDBMSs: PostGIS, DuckDB Spatial, MySQL, and SQL Server. Our testing campaign detected 34 previously unknown and unique bugs in these SDBMS, of which 30 have been confirmed, and 18 have been already fixed. Our testing efforts have been well appreciated by the developers. Experimental results demonstrate that the geometry-aware generator significantly outperforms a naive random-shape generator in detecting unique bugs, and AEI can identify 14 logic bugs in SDBMSs that were overlooked by previous methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Location Modeling for Spatially Aware Object Insertion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13564v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have become a powerful tool for image editing tasks, including object insertion. However, these methods often lack spatial awareness, generating objects with unrealistic locations and scales, or unintentionally altering the scene background. A key challenge lies in maintaining visual coherence, which requires both a geometrically suitable object location and a high-quality image edit. In this paper, we focus on the former, creating a location model dedicated to identifying realistic object locations. Specifically, we train an autoregressive model that generates bounding box coordinates, conditioned on the background image and the desired object class. This formulation allows to effectively handle sparse placement annotations and to incorporate implausible locations into a preference dataset by performing direct preference optimization. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our generative location model, when paired with an inpainting method, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art instruction-tuned models and location modeling baselines in object insertion tasks, delivering accurate and visually coherent results.</p></details> |  |

Network models provide a way of quantifying this process by representing the pathways of information propagation between individuals. Existing approaches to studying these networks largely hypothesize network formation to be a result of cognitive biases and choices about who to connect to. Observational data suggests, however, that physical proximity plays a major role in shaping the formation of communication networks in human groups. Here we report results from a series of agent-based simulations in which agents move around at random in a bounded 2D space and connect while within communication range. Comparing the results to a non-spatial model, we show how including spatial constraints impacts our predictions of network structure: ranged networks are more clustered, with slightly higher degree, higher average shortest path length, a lower number of connected components and a higher small-world index. We find two important drivers of network structure in range-constrained dynamic networks: communication range relative to environment size, and population density. These results show that neglecting spatial constraints in models of network formation makes a difference for predicted network structures. Our simulation model quantifies this part of the process of network formation, realized by simply situating individuals in an environment. The model also provides a tool to include spatial constraints in other models of human communication, as well as dynamic models of network formation more generally.</p></details> |  |

We address limitations of existing methods that overlook domain geometry by proposing an approach based on the Generalized Spatial Regression with PDE Penalization. Our method handles complex-shaped domains, enabling accurate modeling of spatial fields in survival data. Using a penalized log-likelihood functional, we estimate both covariate effects and the spatial field. The methodology is implemented via finite element methods, efficiently handling irregular domain geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy through simulations and apply it to real-world data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Markov Random Fields with Proximity Constraints for Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13164v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The conditional autoregressive (CAR) model, simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model, and its variants have become the predominant strategies for modeling regional or areal-referenced spatial data. The overwhelming wide-use of the CAR/SAR model motivates the need for new classes of models for areal-referenced data. Thus, we develop a novel class of Markov random fields based on truncating the full-conditional distribution. We define this truncation in two ways leading to versions of what we call the truncated autoregressive (TAR) model. First, we truncate the full conditional distribution so that a response at one location is close to the average of its neighbors. This strategy establishes relationships between TAR and CAR. Second, we truncate on the joint distribution of the data process in a similar way. This specification leads to connection between TAR and SAR model. Our Bayesian implementation does not use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for Bayesian computation, and generates samples directly from the posterior distribution. Moreover, TAR does not have a range parameter that arises in the CAR/SAR models, which can be difficult to learn. We present the results of the proposed truncated autoregressive model on several simulated datasets and on a dataset of average property prices.</p></details> | 41 pages, 10 figures |

Specifically, we can vary from a model that is a pure pairwise graph into a model that is almost a pure hypergraph. We use this spatial hypergraph model to study higher-order effects in epidemic spread. We use a susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) epidemic model designed to mimic the spread of an airborne pathogen. We study three types of airborne effects that emulate airborne dilution effects. For the scenario of linear dilution, which roughly correspond to constant ventilation per person as required in many building codes, we see essentially no impact from introducing small hyperedges up to size 15 whereas we do see effects when the hyperedge set is dominated by large hyperedges. Specifically, we track the mean infections after the SIRS epidemic has run for awhile so it is in a "steady state" and find the mean is higher in the large hyperedge regime wheras it is unchanged from pairwise to small hyperedge regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, preprint for Complex Networks 2024</p></details> |

This involves decomposing user requests, selecting candidate points of interest (POIs), ordering the POIs based on cluster-aware spatial optimization, and generating the itinerary.

| **[Mixture of Directed Graphical Models for Discrete Spatial Random Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15700v3)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches for modeling discrete-valued outcomes associated with spatially-dependent areal units incur computational and theoretical challenges, especially in the Bayesian setting when full posterior inference is desired. As an alternative, we propose a novel statistical modeling framework for this data setting, namely a mixture of directed graphical models (MDGMs). The components of the mixture, directed graphical models, can be represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and are computationally quick to evaluate. The DAGs representing the mixture components are selected to correspond to an undirected graphical representation of an assumed spatial contiguity/dependence structure of the areal units, which underlies the specification of traditional modeling approaches for discrete spatial processes such as Markov random fields (MRFs). We introduce the concept of compatibility to show how an undirected graph can be used as a template for the structural dependencies between areal units to create sets of DAGs which, as a collection, preserve the structural dependencies represented in the template undirected graph. We then introduce three classes of compatible DAGs and corresponding algorithms for fitting MDGMs based on these classes. In addition, we compare MDGMs to MRFs and a popular Bayesian MRF model approximation used in high-dimensional settings in a series of simulations and an analysis of ecometrics data collected as part of the Adolescent Health and Development in Context Study.</p></details> |  |

Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of $56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of $9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</p></details> |  |

| **[The importance of spatial and spectral information in multiple speaker tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11453v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-speaker localization and tracking using microphone array recording is of importance in a wide range of applications. One of the challenges with multi-speaker tracking is to associate direction estimates with the correct speaker. Most existing association approaches rely on spatial or spectral information alone, leading to performance degradation when one of these information channels is partially known or missing. This paper studies a joint probability data association (JPDA)-based method that facilitates association based on joint spatial-spectral information. This is achieved by integrating speaker time-frequency (TF) masks, estimated based on spectral information, in the association probabilities calculation. An experimental study that tested the proposed method on recordings from the LOCATA challenge demonstrates the enhanced performance obtained by using joint spatial-spectral information in the association.</p></details> |  |

Traditional simulation-based approaches to generate spatial audio rely on expertise, have limited scalability, and assume independence between semantic and spatial information. To address these issues, we explore end-to-end spatial audio generation. We introduce and formulate a new task of generating first-order Ambisonics (FOA) given a sound category and sound source spatial location. We propose Diff-SAGe, an end-to-end, flow-based diffusion-transformer model for this task. Diff-SAGe utilizes a complex spectrogram representation for FOA, preserving the phase information crucial for accurate spatial cues. Additionally, a multi-conditional encoder integrates the input conditions into a unified representation, guiding the generation of FOA waveforms from noise. Through extensive evaluations on two datasets, we demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional simulation-based baselines across both objective and subjective metrics.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts.

Traditional single-vehicle intelligence systems often perform poorly in such environments due to a lack of global traffic flow information and the ability to respond to unexpected events. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, through real-time communication between vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I), offers a robust solution. However, practical applications still face numerous challenges. Calibration among heterogeneous vehicle and infrastructure endpoints in multi-end LiDAR systems is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of perception system data. Most existing multi-end calibration methods rely on initial calibration values provided by positioning systems, but the instability of GPS signals due to high buildings in urban canyons poses severe challenges to these methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-end LiDAR system calibration method that does not require positioning priors to determine initial external parameters and meets real-time requirements. Our method introduces an innovative multi-end perception object association technique, utilizing a new Overall Distance metric (oDist) to measure the spatial association between perception objects, and effectively combines global consistency search algorithms with optimal transport theory. By this means, we can extract co-observed targets from object association results for further external parameter computation and optimization.

| **[On the Approximability of the Yolk in the Spatial Model of Voting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10788v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the spatial model of voting, the yolk and LP (linear programming) yolk are important solution concepts for predicting outcomes for a committee of voters. McKelvey and Tovey showed that the LP yolk provides a lower bound approximation for the size of the yolk and there has been considerable debate on whether the LP yolk is a good approximation of the yolk. In this paper, we show that for an odd number of voters in a two-dimensional space that the yolk radius is at most twice the size of the LP yolk radius. However, we also show that (1) even in this setting, the LP yolk center can be arbitrarily far away from the yolk center (relative to the radius of the yolk) and (2) for all other settings (an even number of voters or in dimension $k\geq 3$) that the LP yolk can be arbitrarily small relative to the yolk. Thus, in general, the LP yolk can be an arbitrarily poor approximation of the yolk.</p></details> |  |

IJEPA drives representations to capture useful semantic information by predicting in latent rather than input space. However, IJEPA relies on carefully designed context and target windows to avoid representational collapse. The encoder modules in IJEPA cannot adaptively modulate the type of predicted and/or target features based on the feasibility of the masked prediction task as they are not given sufficient information of both context and targets. Based on the intuition that in natural images, information has a strong spatial bias with spatially local regions being highly predictive of one another compared to distant ones. We condition the target encoder and context encoder modules in IJEPA with positions of context and target windows respectively. Our "conditional" encoders show performance gains on several image classification benchmark datasets, improved robustness to context window size and sample-efficiency during pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Self-Supervised Learning - Theory and Practice.

| **[Fully Programmable Spatial Photonic Ising Machine by Focal Plane Division](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10689v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ising machines are an emerging class of hardware that promises ultrafast and energy-efficient solutions to NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. Spatial photonic Ising machines (SPIMs) exploit optical computing in free space to accelerate the computation, showcasing parallelism, scalability, and low power consumption. However, current SPIMs can implement only a restricted class of problems. This partial programmability is a critical limitation that hampers their benchmark. Achieving full programmability of the device while preserving its scalability is an open challenge. Here, we report a fully programmable SPIM achieved through a novel operation method based on the division of the focal plane. In our scheme, a general Ising problem is decomposed into a set of Mattis Hamiltonians, whose energies are simultaneously computed optically by measuring the intensity on different regions of the camera sensor. Exploiting this concept, we experimentally demonstrate the computation with high success probability of ground-state solutions of up to 32-spin Ising models on unweighted maximum cut graphs with and without ferromagnetic bias. Simulations of the hardware prove a favorable scaling of the accuracy with the number of spins. Our fully programmable SPIM enables the implementation of many quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problems, further establishing SPIMs as a leading paradigm in non von Neumann hardware.</p></details> |  |

However, when it comes to stereo audio generation, the soundscapes often have a complex scene of multiple objects and directions. Controlling stereo audio with spatial contexts remains challenging due to high data costs and unstable generative models. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first attempt to address these issues. We first construct a large-scale, simulation-based, and GPT-assisted dataset, BEWO-1M, with abundant soundscapes and descriptions even including moving and multiple sources. Beyond text modality, we have also acquired a set of images and rationally paired stereo audios through retrieval to advance multimodal generation. Existing audio generation models tend to generate rather random and indistinct spatial audio. To provide accurate guidance for latent diffusion models, we introduce the SpatialSonic model utilizing spatial-aware encoders and azimuth state matrices to reveal reasonable spatial guidance. By leveraging spatial guidance, our unified model not only achieves the objective of generating immersive and controllable spatial audio from text and image but also enables interactive audio generation during inference. Finally, under fair settings, we conduct subjective and objective evaluations on simulated and real-world data to compare our approach with prevailing methods. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its capability to generate spatial audio that adheres to physical rules.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge is querying shared niches across diverse tissues, which is crucial for achieving a comprehensive understanding of the organization and phenotypes of cell populations. However, current data analysis methods predominantly focus on creating spatial-aware embeddings for cells, neglecting the development of niche-level representations for effective querying. To address this gap, we introduce QueST, a novel niche representation learning model designed for querying spatial niches across multiple samples. QueST utilizes a novel subgraph contrastive learning approach to explicitly capture niche-level characteristics and incorporates adversarial training to mitigate batch effects. We evaluate QueST on established benchmarks using human and mouse datasets, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art graph representation learning methods in accurate niche queries. Overall, QueST offers a specialized model for spatial niche queries, paving the way for deeper insights into the patterns and mechanisms of cell spatial organization across tissues.

A two-stage least squares estimation method based on profile local linear dummy variables (2SLS-PLLDV) is proposed to estimate both constant and time-varying coefficients without the need for first differencing. The asymptotic properties of the estimator are derived under certain conditions. Furthermore, a residual-based goodness-of-fit test is constructed for the model, and a residual-based bootstrap method is used to obtain p-values. Simulation studies show the good performance of the proposed method in various scenarios.

CGH algorithms decompose 3D scenes into multiplanes at different depth levels and rely on simulations of light that propagated from a source plane to a targeted plane. Thus, for n planes, CGH typically optimizes holograms using n plane-to-plane light transport simulations, leading to major time and computational demands. Our work replaces multiple planes with a focal surface and introduces a learned light transport model that could propagate a light field from a source plane to the focal surface in a single inference. Our learned light transport model leverages spatially adaptive convolution to achieve depth-varying propagation demanded by targeted focal surfaces. The proposed model reduces the hologram optimization process up to 1.5x, which contributes to hologram dataset generation and the training of future learned CGH models.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2024 Technical Communications</p></details> |

The number of visual tokens it outputs affects the efficiency of the MLLM, while the quality of the visual tokens influences the visual understanding capabilities of the MLLM. Current explorations on the projector focus on reducing the number of visual tokens to improve efficiency, often overlooking the inherent spatial discrepancy between the serialized 2-dimensional visual token sequences and natural language token sequences. A Spatial-Aware Efficient Projector (SAEP) is proposed to address this issue. In detail, our SAEP method employs an modified separable depthwise convolution module on multi-layer visual features to enhance the spatial information of visual tokens. As a result, our SAEP method can not only largely reduce the number of visual tokens by 75\%, but also significantly improve the multimodal spatial understanding capability of MLLMs. Moreover, compared to existing projectors, our SAEP gets best performances on massive multimodal evaluation benchmarks, which denotes its effectiveness on bridging the modality gap.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Consequently, we propose a method called Dense Channel Compression for Feature Spatial Solidification. Drawing upon the central concept of this method, we introduce two innovative modules for backbone and head networks: the Dense Channel Compression for Feature Spatial Solidification Structure (DCFS) and the Asymmetric Multi-Level Compression Decoupled Head (ADH). When integrated into the YOLOv5 model, these two modules demonstrate exceptional performance, resulting in a modified model referred to as YOLOCS. Evaluated on the MSCOCO dataset, the large, medium, and small YOLOCS models yield AP of 50.1%, 47.6%, and 42.5%, respectively. Maintaining inference speeds remarkably similar to those of the YOLOv5 model, the large, medium, and small YOLOCS models surpass the YOLOv5 model's AP by 1.1%, 2.3%, and 5.2%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

With our motivation arising from the real estate industry, namely in real estate valuation, we use the Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) for county-level values to show the change in prediction when the loss is different (asymmetric) from a traditional squared error loss (symmetric) function. Additionally, we discuss the importance of choosing the asymmetry parameter, and propose a solution to this choice for a general asymmetric loss function. Since the focus is on area-level data predictions, we propose the methodology in the context of conditionally autoregressive (CAR) models. We conclude that choice of the loss functions for spatial area-level predictions can play a crucial role, and is heavily driven by the choice of parameters in the respective loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Expeditious Spatial Mean Radiant Temperature Mapping Framework using Visual SLAM and Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09443v1)** | 2024-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring thermal comfort is essential for the well-being and productivity of individuals in built environments. Of the various thermal comfort indicators, the mean radiant temperature (MRT) is very challenging to measure. Most common measurement methodologies are time-consuming and not user-friendly. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel MRT measurement framework that uses visual simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and semantic segmentation techniques. The proposed approach follows the rule of thumb of the traditional MRT calculation method using surface temperature and view factors. However, it employs visual SLAM and creates a 3D thermal point cloud with enriched surface temperature information. The framework then implements Grounded SAM, a new object detection and segmentation tool to extract features with distinct temperature profiles on building surfaces. The detailed segmentation of thermal features not only reduces potential errors in the calculation of the MRT but also provides an efficient reconstruction of the spatial MRT distribution in the indoor environment. We also validate the calculation results with the reference measurement methodology. This data-driven framework offers faster and more efficient MRT measurements and spatial mapping than conventional methods. It can enable the direct engagement of researchers and practitioners in MRT measurements and contribute to research on thermal comfort and radiant cooling and heating systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshop</p></details> |

However, existing traffic forecasting models still face the following limitations. On one hand, most previous studies either focus too much on real-world geographic information, neglecting the potential traffic correlation between different regions, or overlook geographical position and only model the traffic flow relationship. On the other hand, the importance of different time slices is ignored in time modeling. Therefore, we propose a Fusion Matrix Prompt Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial-Temporal Interactive Traffic Forecasting Framework (FMPESTF), which is composed of spatial and temporal modules for down-sampling traffic data. The network is designed to establish a traffic fusion matrix considering spatial-temporal heterogeneity as a query to reconstruct a data-driven dynamic traffic data structure, which accurately reveal the flow relationship of nodes in the traffic network. In addition, we introduce attention mechanism in time modeling, and design hierarchical spatial-temporal interactive learning to help the model adapt to various traffic scenarios. Through extensive experimental on six real-world traffic datasets, our method is significantly superior to other baseline models, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in dealing with traffic forecasting problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>THE W...</summary><p>THE WEB CONFERENCE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Measurement Error Correction for Spatially Defined Environmental Exposures in Survival Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09278v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Environmental exposures are often defined using buffer zones around geocoded home addresses, but these static boundaries can miss dynamic daily activity patterns, leading to biased results. This paper presents a novel measurement error correction method for spatially defined environmental exposures within a survival analysis framework using the Cox proportional hazards model. The method corrects high-dimensional surrogate exposures from geocoded residential data at multiple buffer radii by applying principal component analysis for dimension reduction and leveraging external GPS-tracked validation datasets containing true exposure measurements. It also derives the asymptotic properties and variances of the proposed estimators. Extensive simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed estimators, demonstrating its ability to improve accuracy in estimated exposure effects. An illustrative application assesses the impact of greenness exposure on depression incidence in the Nurses' Health Study (NHS). The results demonstrate that correcting for measurement error significantly enhances the accuracy of exposure estimates. This method offers a critical advancement for accurately assessing the health impacts of environmental exposures, outperforming traditional static buffer approaches.</p></details> |  |

The first velocity model is stationary and is based solely on $V_{S30}$; the second velocity model is spatially varying and has location-specific adjustments. They were developed using a dataset of 200 measured $V_S$ profiles. Both models were formulated within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, using a parameterization that ensures robust scaling. The spatially varying model includes a slope adjustment term modeled as a Gaussian process to capture site-specific effects based on location. Residual analysis shows that both models are unbiased for $V_S$ values up to 1000 m/sec. Along-depth variability models were also developed using within-profile residuals. The proposed models show higher $V_S$ in the San Jose area and Livermore Valley compared to the USGS Bay Area community velocity model by a factor of two or more in some cases. Goodness-of-fit (GOF) comparisons using one-dimensional linear site-response analysis at selected sites demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the USGS model in capturing near-surface amplification across a broad frequency range. Incorporating along-depth variability further improves the GOF scores by reducing over-amplification at high frequencies. These results underscore the importance of integrating data-driven models of the shallow crust, like the ones presented here, in coarser regional community velocity models to enhance regional seismic hazard assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript: 18 pages, 12 figures.

This current use case and future applications of this technology will determine where and when the fleets operate, potentially resulting in a divergence from the distribution of driving of some human benchmark population within a given locality. Existing benchmarks for evaluating ADS performance have only done county-level geographical matching of the ADS and benchmark driving exposure in crash rates. This study presents a novel methodology for constructing dynamic human benchmarks that adjust for spatial and temporal variations in driving distribution between an ADS and the overall human driven fleet. Dynamic benchmarks were generated using human police-reported crash data, human vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data, and over 20 million miles of Waymo's rider-only (RO) operational data accumulated across three US counties. The spatial adjustment revealed significant differences across various severity levels in adjusted crash rates compared to unadjusted benchmarks with these differences ranging from 10% to 47% higher in San Francisco, 12% to 20% higher in Maricopa, and 7% lower to 34% higher in Los Angeles counties. The time-of-day adjustment in San Francisco, limited to this region due to data availability, resulted in adjusted crash rates 2% lower to 16% higher than unadjusted rates, depending on severity level. The findings underscore the importance of adjusting for spatial and temporal confounders in benchmarking analysis, which ultimately contributes to a more equitable benchmark for ADS performance evaluations.</p></details> |  |

Affordance regions are defined as object parts that provide interaction possibilities to an agent. For example, the bottom of a bottle affords the object to be placed on a surface, while its spout affords the contained liquid to be poured. We propose a novel approach to learn changes of affordance constraints in human demonstration to construct spatial bimanual action models representing object interactions. To exploit the information encoded in these spatial bimanual action models, we formulate an optimization problem to determine optimal object configurations across multiple execution keypoints while taking into account the initial scene, the learned affordance constraints, and the robot's kinematics. We evaluate the approach in simulation with two example tasks (pouring drinks and rolling dough) and compare three different definitions of affordance constraints: (i) component-wise distances between affordance regions in Cartesian space, (ii) component-wise distances between affordance regions in cylindrical space, and (iii) degrees of satisfaction of manually defined symbolic spatial affordance constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accepted for publication at Humanoids 2024 - This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</p></details> |  |

Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%).

Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables, under review in Applied Ocean Research Journal</p></details> |

To make the cooperation safe for the humans involved, the systems have to follow protocols with rigid real-time and real-space properties, but they also need to be capable of making competitive and collaborative decisions with varying rewards and penalties. Due to these tough requirements, the construction of system control software is often very difficult. This calls for applying a model-based engineering approach, which allows one to formally express the time and space properties and use them as guidance for the whole engineering process from requirement definition via system design to software development. Moreover, it is beneficial, if one can verify with acceptable effort, that the time and space requirements are preserved throughout the development steps. This paper focuses on modelling spatio-temporal properties and their model-checking and simulation using different analysis tools in combination with the methods and tool extensions proposed here. To this end, we provide an informal overview of CASTeL, our CASTeLogic. CASTeL is stochastic and includes real-time concurrency and real-space distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We present a comprehensive investigation of Graph U-Nets, originally developed for classification tasks, now tailored for mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal forecasting of fluid dynamics. Our focus is on enhancing their performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and architectural modifications. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements in both transductive and inductive learning settings, showcasing the adaptability of Graph U-Nets to various flow conditions and mesh structures. This work contributes to the field of reduced-order modeling for computational fluid dynamics by establishing Graph U-Nets as a viable and flexible alternative to convolutional neural networks, capable of accurately and efficiently predicting complex fluid flow phenomena across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the occupancy rate from large-scale datasets to identify gaps between supply and demand in public transportation. Leveraging the spatio-temporal granularity of data from Automatic People Counting (APC) and relying on the Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model and the Generalized Mixed-Effect Random Forest, in this study we propose a methodology for analyzing factors determining undercrowding. The results of the model are examined at both the segment and ride levels. Initially, the analysis focuses on identifying segments more likely associated with undercrowding, understanding factors influencing the probability of undercrowding, and exploring their relationships. Subsequently, the analysis extends to the temporal distribution of undercrowding, encompassing its impact on the entire journey. The proposed methodology is applied to analyze APC data, provided by the company responsible for public transport management in Milan, on a radial route of the surface transportation network.</p></details> | Pre-print version |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Prompt-Guided Spatio-Temporal Transformer Model for National-Wide Nuclear Radiation Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11924v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear radiation (NR), which refers to the energy emitted from atomic nuclei during decay, poses substantial risks to human health and environmental safety. Accurate forecasting of nuclear radiation levels is crucial for informed decision-making by both individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, an innovative framework tailored for national-wide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against seven baselines. This research not only enhances the accuracy and reliability in nuclear radiation forecasting but also contributes to advancing emergency response strategies and monitoring systems, thereby safeguarding environmental and public health.</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, the restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to the low resolution of ODVs. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods are proposed to enhance the resolution of videos, but ODV projection distortions in the application are not well addressed directly applying such methods. To achieve better super-resolution reconstruction quality, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatio-temporal distortion modulation module is introduced to improve spatial ODV projection distortions and exploit the temporal correlation according to intra and inter alignments. Next, we design a multi-frame reconstruction and fusion mechanism to refine the consistency of reconstructed ODV frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive maps in the loss function to concentrate on important viewpoint regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In addition, we collect a new ODV-SR dataset with various scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STDAN achieves superior super-resolution performance on ODVs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoChat: Joints-Grouped Spatio-Temporal Grounding LLM for Multi-Turn Motion Comprehension and Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11404v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite continuous advancements in deep learning for understanding human motion, existing models often struggle to accurately identify action timing and specific body parts, typically supporting only single-round interaction. Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Get Rid of Task Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Masked Autoencoder for Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10915v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective spatio-temporal prediction frameworks play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, the presence of data noise and label sparsity in spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges for existing neural network models in learning effective and robust region representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph masked autoencoder paradigm that explores generative self-supervised learning for effective spatio-temporal data augmentation. Our proposed framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph neural encoder that captures region-wise dependencies from heterogeneous data sources, enabling the modeling of diverse spatial dependencies. In our spatio-temporal self-supervised learning paradigm, we incorporate a masked autoencoding mechanism on node representations and structures. This mechanism automatically distills heterogeneous spatio-temporal dependencies across regions over time, enhancing the learning process of dynamic region-wise spatial correlations. To validate the effectiveness of our STGMAE framework, we conduct extensive experiments on various spatio-temporal mining tasks. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art baselines. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework in terms of performance and its ability to address the challenges of spatial and temporal data noise and sparsity in practical urban sensing scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gridded Transformer Neural Processes for Large Unstructured Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06731v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Enhanced by anthropogenic activities and global warming, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in frequency and global distribution. Early warning systems (EWS) for cyanobacterial blooms development allow timely implementation of management measures, reducing the risks associated to these blooms. In this paper, we propose an effective EWS for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting, which uses 6 years of incomplete high-frequency spatio-temporal data from multiparametric probes, including phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence as a proxy for cyanobacteria. A probe agnostic and replicable method is proposed to pre-process the data and to generate time series specific for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting. Using these pre-processed data, six different non-site/species-specific predictive models were compared including the autoregressive and multivariate versions of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) neural networks. Results were analyzed for seven forecasting time horizons ranging from 4 to 28 days evaluated with a hybrid system that combined regression metrics (MSE, R2, MAPE) for PC values, classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, Kappa) for a proposed alarm level of 10 ug PC/L, and a forecasting-specific metric to measure prediction improvement over the displaced signal (skill). The multivariate version of LSTM showed the best and most consistent results across all forecasting horizons and metrics, achieving accuracies of up to 90% in predicting the proposed PC alarm level. Additionally, positive skill values indicated its outstanding effectiveness to forecast cyanobacterial blooms from 16 to 28 days in advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Spatio-temporal Correlation for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06893v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios. The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels. This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%). Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts. Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes. The code is available on https://github.com/halbielee/PLE.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC\&S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhances power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes a multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC\&S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Different from the common penalty-based approach, this work promotes adherence to the underlying physical mechanism that facilitates statistical procedures. The motivating application concerns modeling fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which is used for characterization of diffusion processes. We propose a physics-encoded regression model for handling spatio-temporally distributed data, which enables principled interpretability, parsimonious computation and efficient estimation by exploiting the structure of solutions of a governing evolution equation. The rate of convergence attaining the minimax optimality is theoretically demonstrated, generalizing the result obtained for the spatial regression. We conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of our proposed estimator and illustrate its usage in the aforementioned real data example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Eurohaptics 2024</p></details> |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of large spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |
| **[Arges: Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Assessment in Endoscopy Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00536v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of disease severity from endoscopy videos in ulcerative colitis (UC) is crucial for evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials. Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unifying Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17360v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph learning is a fundamental problem in modern urban systems. Existing approaches tackle different tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs misalign with the current research efforts toward unifying spatio-temporal graph learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model these tasks in a unified probabilistic perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared dependencies. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly under the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising decoders that are task-specific. The encoder, optimized by pre-training strategies, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The decoders, utilizing attention mechanisms, generate predictions by leveraging learned patterns. Opting for forecasting and kriging, the decoders are designed as Spatial Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions. Combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic decoders, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both deterministic and probabilistic baselines, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

Our proposed method applies DETR to each frame and uses feature shift to incorporate temporal information. However, DETR's object queries in each frame may correspond to different objects, making a simple feature shift ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose query matching across different frames, ensuring that queries for the same object are matched and used for the feature shift. Experimental results show that performance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features are shifted using the proposed query matching.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions.

| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

| **[EventAug: Multifaceted Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentation Methods for Event-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11813v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |

Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |

However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field.

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating velocities of infectious disease spread through spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox point processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05036v1)** | 2024-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19 is crucial for informed decision-making and resource allocation. A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region.

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with identifiable variational autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04162v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with complex dependency structures is a challenging task but can be simplified by assuming that the original variables are generated from independent latent components. If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mending of Spatio-Temporal Dependencies in Block Adjacency Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02606v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of applications where data dynamically evolves across spatial and temporal dimensions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often complemented by sequence modeling architectures, such as RNNs and transformers, to effectively model temporal changes. These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Eigen-Cluster VIS: Improving Weakly-supervised Video Instance Segmentation by Leveraging Spatio-temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16661v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks. However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently.

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |

Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Prediction Methodology Based on Deep Learning and Real Wi-Fi Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09423v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Wi-Fi technologies in recent years has caused a significant increase in the traffic usage. Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead. We made our proposed OpenCity model open-source and it is available at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenCity.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation.

| **[System States Forecasting of Microservices with Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07894v1)** | 2024-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the AIOps (Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations) era, accurately forecasting system states is crucial. In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is proved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a way to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra high-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go to infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |

This compressor comprehensively considers both temporal and spatial information, encompassing many existing specific compressors. We use the average consensus algorithm as a starting point and further studies distributed optimization algorithms, the Prime-Dual algorithm as an example, in both continuous and discrete time forms. We find that under stronger additional assumptions, the spatio-temporal compressor can be directly applied to distributed computing algorithms, while its default form can also be successfully applied through observer-based differential compression methods, ensuring the linear convergence of the algorithm when the objective function is strongly convex. On this basis, we also discuss the acceleration of the algorithm, filter-based compression methods in the literature, and the addition of randomness to the spatio-temporal compressor. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the generality of the spatio-temporal compressor, compare different compression methods, and verify the algorithm's performance in the convex objective function scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

We benchmark SET against said models on the charged $N$-body problem, a simple physical system with complex dynamics. While existing spatio-temporal graph neural networks focus on sequential modeling, we empirically demonstrate that leveraging underlying domain symmetries yields considerable improvements for modeling dynamical systems on graphs.</p></details> |  |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecSTG: A Fast Spectral Diffusion Framework for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08119v3)** | 2024-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic forecasting, a crucial application of spatio-temporal graph (STG) learning, has traditionally relied on deterministic models for accurate point estimations. Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting. The source code for SpecSTG is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SpecSTG.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2024)</p></details> |

It can be employed to extract key information from a limited number of samples and generate new synthetic samples in a way that potentially improves the performance of PHM solutions. This is especially valuable in situations of data scarcity which are very usual in PHM, especially for failure prognostics. The proposed approach is tested based on the CMAPSS dataset, commonly employed for prognostics experiments and benchmarks.

We develop a three-step frequency-domain identification method for linear CT DCNs that allows to accurately recover all the physical component values of the network while exploiting the particular symmetric structure in a DCN model. This method uses the estimated noise covariance as a non-parametric noise model to minimize variance of the parameter estimates, obviating the need to select a parametric noise model. Moreover, this method is extended to subnetworks identification, which enables identifying the local dynamics in DCNs on the basis of partial measurements. The method is illustrated with an application from In-Circuit Testing of printed circuit boards. Experimental results highlight the method's ability to consistently estimate component values in a complex network with only a single excitation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, extended version of paper submitted to European Control Conference, 2025, Thessaloniki, Greece</p></details> |

| **[Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18712v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While time series diffusion models have received considerable focus from many recent works, the performance of existing models remains highly unstable. Factors limiting time series diffusion models include insufficient time series datasets and the absence of guidance. To address these limitations, we propose a Retrieval- Augmented Time series Diffusion model (RATD). The framework of RATD consists of two parts: an embedding-based retrieval process and a reference-guided diffusion model. In the first part, RATD retrieves the time series that are most relevant to historical time series from the database as references. The references are utilized to guide the denoising process in the second part. Our approach allows leveraging meaningful samples within the database to aid in sampling, thus maximizing the utilization of datasets. Meanwhile, this reference-guided mechanism also compensates for the deficiencies of existing time series diffusion models in terms of guidance. Experiments and visualizations on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in complicated prediction tasks.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, existing approaches often overlook the crucial dynamic temporal information inherent in time series data and face challenges in aligning this data with textual semantics. To address these limitations, we propose HiTime, a hierarchical multi-modal model that seamlessly integrates temporal information into LLMs for multivariate time series classification (MTSC). Our model employs a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data through both data-specific and task-specific embeddings. To facilitate semantic space alignment between time series and text, we introduce a dual-view contrastive alignment module that bridges the gap between modalities. Additionally, we adopt a hybrid prompting strategy to fine-tune the pre-trained LLM in a parameter-efficient manner. By effectively incorporating dynamic temporal features and ensuring semantic alignment, HiTime enables LLMs to process continuous time series data and achieves state-of-the-art classification performance through text generation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that HiTime significantly enhances time series classification accuracy compared to most competitive baseline methods. Our findings highlight the potential of integrating temporal features into LLMs, paving the way for advanced time series analysis. The code is publicly available for further research and validation.

While previous works have often predicted the fractured and restored shape in one step, we approach the task by separately predicting the fractured and newly restored parts, but ensuring these predictions are interconnected. We use a decoder network motivated by related work on the prediction of signed distance functions (DeepSDF). In particular, our representation allows us to consider test-time-training, i.e., finetuning network parameters to match the given incomplete shape more accurately during inference. While previous works often have difficulties with artifacts around the fracture boundary, we demonstrate that our overfitting to the fractured parts leads to significant improvements in the restoration of eight different shape categories of the ShapeNet data set in terms of their chamfer distances.</p></details> |  |

Sangalli (2023), have introduced unconditionally stable schemes by adding non-consistent penalty terms to the underlying bilinear form. Stability and error analysis have been carried out for lowest order discrete spaces. While higher order methods have shown promising properties through numerical testing, their rigorous analysis was still missing. In this paper, we address this stability analysis by studying the properties of the condition number of a family of matrices associated with the time discretization. For each spline order, we derive explicit estimates of both the CFL condition required in the unstabilized case and the penalty term that minimises the consistency error in the stabilized case. Numerical tests confirm the sharpness of our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[NIDS Neural Networks Using Sliding Time Window Data Processing with Trainable Activations and its Generalization Capability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18658v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents neural networks for network intrusion detection systems (NIDS), that operate on flow data preprocessed with a time window. It requires only eleven features which do not rely on deep packet inspection and can be found in most NIDS datasets and easily obtained from conventional flow collectors. The time window aggregates information with respect to hosts facilitating the identification of flow signatures that are missed by other aggregation methods. Several network architectures are studied and the use of Kalmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)-inspired trainable activation functions that help to achieve higher accuracy with simpler network structure is proposed. The reported training accuracy exceeds 99% for the proposed method with as little as twenty neural network input features. This work also studies the generalization capability of NIDS, a crucial aspect that has not been adequately addressed in the previous studies. The generalization experiments are conducted using CICIDS2017 dataset and a custom dataset collected as part of this study. It is shown that the performance metrics decline significantly when changing datasets, and the reduction in performance metrics can be attributed to the difference in signatures of the same type flows in different datasets, which in turn can be attributed to the differences between the underlying networks. It is shown that the generalization accuracy of some neural networks can be very unstable and sensitive to random initialization parameters, and neural networks with fewer parameters and well-tuned activations are more stable and achieve higher accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 3 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Advance warnings on impending disasters facilitate timely and targeted response which help save lives and livelihoods. In this work we present a quantitative methodology to forecast levels of food consumption for 60 consecutive days, at the sub-national level, in four countries: Mali, Nigeria, Syria, and Yemen. The methodology is built on publicly available data from the World Food Programme's global hunger monitoring system which collects, processes, and displays daily updates on key food security metrics, conflict, weather events, and other drivers of food insecurity. In this study we assessed the performance of various models including Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) Network, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), and Reservoir Computing (RC), by comparing their Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics. Our findings highlight Reservoir Computing as a particularly well-suited model in the field of food security given both its notable resistance to over-fitting on limited data samples and its efficient training capabilities. The methodology we introduce establishes the groundwork for a global, data-driven early warning system designed to anticipate and detect food insecurity.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures + supplementary material</p></details> |

However, mobility and non-rigid sensor mounts introduce extrinsic calibration errors, necessitating online calibration, further complicated by limited overlap in sensing regions. Moreover, maintaining fresh information is crucial for timely and accurate sensing. To address calibration errors and ensure timely and accurate perception, we propose a robust task-oriented communication strategy to optimize online self-calibration and efficient feature sharing for Real-time Adaptive Collaborative Perception (R-ACP). Specifically, we first formulate an Age of Perceived Targets (AoPT) minimization problem to capture data timeliness of multi-view streaming. Then, in the calibration phase, we introduce a channel-aware self-calibration technique based on re-identification (Re-ID), which adaptively compresses key features according to channel capacities, effectively addressing calibration issues via spatial and temporal cross-camera correlations. In the streaming phase, we tackle the trade-off between bandwidth and inference accuracy by leveraging an Information Bottleneck (IB) based encoding method to adjust video compression rates based on task relevance, thereby reducing communication overhead and latency. Finally, we design a priority-aware network to filter corrupted features to mitigate performance degradation from packet corruption. Extensive studies demonstrate that our framework outperforms five baselines, improving multiple object detection accuracy (MODA) by 25.49% and reducing communication costs by 51.36% under severely poor channel conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective Finite Time Stability Control for Human-Machine Shared Vehicle Following System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18007v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of intelligent connected vehicle technology, human-machine shared control has gained popularity in vehicle following due to its effectiveness in driver assistance. However, traditional vehicle following systems struggle to maintain stability when driver reaction time fluctuates, as these variations require different levels of system intervention. To address this issue, the proposed human-machine shared vehicle following assistance system (HM-VFAS) integrates driver outputs under various states with the assistance system. The system employs an intelligent driver model that accounts for reaction time delays, simulating time-varying driver outputs. A control authority allocation strategy is designed to dynamically adjust the level of intervention based on real-time driver state assessment. To handle instability from driver authority switching, the proposed solution includes a two-layer adaptive finite time sliding mode controller (A-FTSMC). The first layer is an integral sliding mode adaptive controller that ensures robustness by compensating for uncertainties in the driver output. The second layer is a fast non-singular terminal sliding mode controller designed to accelerate convergence for rapid stabilization. Using real driver videos as inputs, the performance of the HM-VFAS was evaluated. Results show that the proposed control strategy maintains a safe distance under time-varying driver states, with the actual acceleration error relative to the target acceleration maintained within 0.5m/s~2 and the maximum acceleration error reduced by 1.2m/s~2. Compared to traditional controllers, the A-FTSMC controller offers faster convergence and less vibration, reducing the stabilization time by 27.3%.</p></details> |  |

Previous works have proposed a variety of test-time adaptation (TTA) methods to achieve strong generalization without any knowledge of the target domain. However, existing training-required TTA approaches like TPT necessitate entropy minimization that involves large computational overhead, while training-free methods like TDA overlook the potential for information mining from the test samples themselves. In this paper, we break down the design of existing popular training-required and training-free TTA methods and bridge the gap between them within our framework. Specifically, we maintain a light-weight key-value memory for feature retrieval from instance-agnostic historical samples and instance-aware boosting samples. The historical samples are filtered from the testing data stream and serve to extract useful information from the target distribution, while the boosting samples are drawn from regional bootstrapping and capture the knowledge of the test sample itself. We theoretically justify the rationality behind our method and empirically verify its effectiveness on both the out-of-distribution and the cross-domain datasets, showcasing its applicability in real-world situations.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[TimeXer: Empowering Transformers for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19072v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep models have demonstrated remarkable performance in time series forecasting. However, due to the partially-observed nature of real-world applications, solely focusing on the target of interest, so-called endogenous variables, is usually insufficient to guarantee accurate forecasting. Notably, a system is often recorded into multiple variables, where the exogenous variables can provide valuable external information for endogenous variables. Thus, unlike well-established multivariate or univariate forecasting paradigms that either treat all the variables equally or ignore exogenous information, this paper focuses on a more practical setting: time series forecasting with exogenous variables. We propose a novel approach, TimeXer, to ingest external information to enhance the forecasting of endogenous variables. With deftly designed embedding layers, TimeXer empowers the canonical Transformer with the ability to reconcile endogenous and exogenous information, where patch-wise self-attention and variate-wise cross-attention are used simultaneously. Moreover, global endogenous tokens are learned to effectively bridge the causal information underlying exogenous series into endogenous temporal patches. Experimentally, TimeXer achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance on twelve real-world forecasting benchmarks and exhibits notable generality and scalability.

Hyperspectral line-scan cameras are a low-cost solution that enhance confidence in anomaly detection over RGB and multispectral imagery. However, existing line-scan algorithms are too slow when using small computers (e.g. those onboard a drone or small satellite), do not adapt to changing scenery, or lack robustness against geometric distortions. This paper introduces the Exponentially moving RX algorithm (ERX) to address these issues, and compares it with existing RX-based anomaly detection methods for hyperspectral line scanning. Three large and more complex datasets are also introduced to better assess the practical challenges when using line-scan cameras (two hyperspectral and one multispectral). ERX is evaluated using a Jetson Xavier NX compute module, achieving the best combination of speed and detection performance. This research paves the way for future studies in grouping and locating anomalous objects, adaptive and automatic threshold selection, and real-time field tests.

| **[FDF: Flexible Decoupled Framework for Time Series Forecasting with Conditional Denoising and Polynomial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13253v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is vital in numerous web applications, influencing critical decision-making across industries. While diffusion models have recently gained increasing popularity for this task, we argue they suffer from a significant drawback: indiscriminate noise addition to the original time series followed by denoising, which can obscure underlying dynamic evolving trend and complicate forecasting. To address this limitation, we propose a novel flexible decoupled framework (FDF) that learns high-quality time series representations for enhanced forecasting performance. A key characteristic of our approach leverages the inherent inductive bias of time series data of its decomposed trend and seasonal components, each modeled separately to enable decoupled analysis and modeling. Specifically, we propose an innovative Conditional Denoising Seasonal Module (CDSM) within the diffusion model, which leverages statistical information from the historical window to conditionally model the complex seasonal component. Notably, we incorporate a Polynomial Trend Module (PTM) to effectively capture the smooth trend component, thereby enhancing the model's ability to represent temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods and highlighting its flexibility in time series forecasting.

This paper introduces a breakthrough in the understanding, design, and application of conditional information reveal systems that are highly secure and decentralized. By designing a new practical timed-release cryptography system and a secret sharing scheme with reveal-verifiability, a novel data sharing system is devised on the blockchain that "sends messages in the future" with highly accurate decryption times. Notably, the proposed secret sharing scheme applies to other applications requiring verifiability of revealed secret shares. This paper provides a complete evaluation portfolio of this pioneering paradigm, including analytical results, a validation of its robustness in the Tamarin Prover and a performance evaluation of a real-world, open-source system prototype deployed across the globe.

However, the self-attention mechanism introduces challenges in terms of computational efficiency due to its quadratic time complexity. To address these issues, we propose a novel architectural framework that enhances Transformer models through the integration of Surrogate Attention Blocks (SAB) and Surrogate Feed-Forward Neural Network Blocks (SFB). They replace the self-attention and feed-forward layer by leveraging structured matrices that reduce both time and space complexity while maintaining the expressive power of the original self-attention mechanism and feed-forward network. The equivalence of this substitution is fully demonstrated. Extensive experiments on nine Transformer variants across five distinct time series tasks demonstrate an average performance improvement of 9.45%, alongside a 46% reduction in model size. These results confirm the efficacy of our surrogate-based approach in maintaining prediction accuracy while significantly boosting computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing relighting methods are either time-consuming or unable to adjust the viewpoints. In this paper, we present the first real-time 3D-aware method for relighting in-the-wild videos of talking faces based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). Given an input portrait video, our method can synthesize talking faces under both novel views and novel lighting conditions with a photo-realistic and disentangled 3D representation. Specifically, we infer an albedo tri-plane, as well as a shading tri-plane based on a desired lighting condition for each video frame with fast dual-encoders. We also leverage a temporal consistency network to ensure smooth transitions and reduce flickering artifacts. Our method runs at 32.98 fps on consumer-level hardware and achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of reconstruction quality, lighting error, lighting instability, temporal consistency and inference speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and interactivity of our method on various portrait videos with diverse lighting and viewing conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024 (Highlight).

Despite recent deep learning advancements, increased model complexity, and larger model sizes, many state-of-the-art models often perform worse or on par with simpler models. One of those cases is a recently proposed model, FITS, claiming competitive performance with significantly reduced parameter counts. By training a one-layer neural network in the complex frequency domain, we are able to replicate these results. Our experiments on a wide range of real-world datasets further reveal that FITS especially excels at capturing periodic and seasonal patterns, but struggles with trending, non-periodic, or random-resembling behavior. With our two novel hybrid approaches, where we attempt to remedy the weaknesses of FITS by combining it with DLinear, we achieve the best results of any known open-source model on multivariate regression and promising results in multiple/linear regression on price datasets, on top of vastly improving upon what FITS achieves as a standalone model.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv:2307.03756v3 45 pages, 36 figures</p></details> |

We show that popular time estimates based on FLOPs are poor estimates, and construct a more accurate proxy based on memory copies. This allows us to accurately estimate the training speed of a transformer model from its hyperparameters. Combined with a scaling law curve like Chinchilla, this allows us to accurately predict the final loss of a model from a simple equation. We show that this expression is accurate across a wide range of model hyperparameter values, enabling us to analytically make architectural decisions and train models more efficiently. Crucially, this analysis predicts that in contrast to existing literature, models should be wider rather than deeper, as the benefits of speed outweigh the benefits of depth.</p></details> |  |

However, the prevailing level-of-detail solution employing hair cards for distant hair models introduces a significant discontinuity in dynamics and appearance during the transition from strands to cards. We introduce an innovative real-time framework for strand-based hair rendering that ensures seamless transitions between different levels of detail (LOD) while maintaining a consistent hair appearance. Our method uses elliptical thick hairs that contain multiple hair strands at each LOD to maintain the shapes of hair clusters. In addition to geometric fitting, we formulate an elliptical Bidirectional Curve Scattering Distribution Functions (BCSDF) model for a thick hair, accurately capturing single scattering and multiple scattering within the hair cluster, accommodating a spectrum from sparse to dense hair distributions. Our framework, tested on various hairstyles with dynamics as well as knits, shows that it can produce highly similar appearances to full hair geometries at different viewing distances with seamless LOD transitions, while achieving up to a 3x speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, 1 performance plot</p></details> |

We model the problem by means of a finite automaton that has to be explored in order to check for schedulability. To mitigate the state explosion problem, we provide a generic algorithm which is parameterised by several techniques called oracles and simulation relations. These techniques leverage results from the scheduling literature as "plug-ins" that make the algorithm more efficient in practice. Our approach achieves up to a 99.998% reduction in the search space required for exact schedulability testing, making it practical for a range of task sets, up to 8 tasks or maximum periods of 350.

Currently, customers of cloud video services are unaware of the cost of transcoding their files until the task is completed. Previous work concentrated on predicting perclip compression time, and thus estimating the cost of video compression. In this work, we propose new Machine Learning (ML) systems which predict cost for the entire corpus instead. This is a more appropriate goal since users are not interested in per-clip cost but instead the cost for the whole corpus. In this work, we evaluate our systems with respect to two video codecs (x264, x265) and a novel high-quality video corpus. We find that the accuracy of aggregate time prediction for a video corpus more than two times better than using per-clip predictions. Furthermore, we present an online inference framework in which we update the ML models as files are processed. A consideration of video compute overhead and appropriate choice of ML predictor for each fraction of corpus completed yields a prediction error of less than 5%. This is approximately two times better than previous work which proposed generalised predictors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE International Conference on Visual Communications and Image Processing (VCIP) 2024</p></details> |

By incorporating this advantage gap function into the design of step size rules and deriving a new linear rate of convergence that is independent of the stationary state distribution of the optimal policy, we demonstrate that policy gradient methods can solve MDPs in strongly-polynomial time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such strong convergence properties have been established for policy gradient methods. Moreover, in the stochastic setting, where only stochastic estimates of policy gradients are available, we show that the advantage gap function provides close approximations of the optimality gap for each individual state and exhibits a sublinear rate of convergence at every state. The advantage gap function can be easily estimated in the stochastic case, and when coupled with easily computable upper bounds on policy values, they provide a convenient way to validate the solutions generated by policy gradient methods. Therefore, our developments offer a principled and computable measure of optimality for RL, whereas current practice tends to rely on algorithm-to-algorithm or baselines comparisons with no certificate of optimality.</p></details> |  |

We propose a random space-time sampling regime, referred to as {randomized} dynamical sampling, where a small subset of space-time nodes is randomly selected at each time step based on a probability distribution. To analyze the recovery problem, we establish a rigorous mathematical framework by introducing the parameter \textit{the dynamic spectral graph weighted coherence}. This key parameter governs the number of space-time samples needed for stable recovery and extends the idea of variable density sampling to the context of dynamical systems. By optimizing the sampling probability distribution, we show that as few as $\mathcal{O}(s \log(k))$ space-time samples are sufficient for accurate reconstruction in optimal scenarios, where $k$ denotes the bandwidth of the signal. Our framework encompasses both static and dynamic cases, demonstrating a reduction in the number of spatial samples needed at each time step by exploiting temporal correlations. Furthermore, we provide a computationally efficient and robust algorithm for signal reconstruction. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results and illustrate the practical efficacy of our proposed methods.</p></details> | 23 pages |

The objective of dataset condensation is to ensure that the model trained with the synthetic dataset can perform comparably to the model trained with full datasets. However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on classification tasks, posing challenges in their adaptation to time series forecasting (TS-forecasting). This challenge arises from disparities in the evaluation of synthetic data. In classification, the synthetic data is considered well-distilled if the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset yield identical labels for the same input, regardless of variations in output logits distribution. Conversely, in TS-forecasting, the effectiveness of synthetic data distillation is determined by the distance between predictions of the two models. The synthetic data is deemed well-distilled only when all data points within the predictions are similar. Consequently, TS-forecasting has a more rigorous evaluation methodology compared to classification. To mitigate this gap, we theoretically analyze the optimization objective of dataset condensation for TS-forecasting and propose a new one-line plugin of dataset condensation designated as Dataset Condensation for Time Series Forecasting (CondTSF) based on our analysis. Plugging CondTSF into previous dataset condensation methods facilitates a reduction in the distance between the predictions of the model trained with the full dataset and the model trained with the synthetic dataset, thereby enhancing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on eight commonly used time series datasets. CondTSF consistently improves the performance of all previous dataset condensation methods across all datasets, particularly at low condensing ratios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024, the project can be found at https://github.com/RafaDD/CondTSF</p></details> |

The experimental results demonstrate an average of 4.5 seconds of response time on 1000 concurrent users and 92% of user preferences accuracy. The cost efficiency is proved, with 95% of provided trips being within the limits of the budget declared by the user. The system also implements some measures to alleviate negative externalities related to travel and 60% of offered travel plans had green options incorporated, resulting in the average 15% lower carbon emissions than the traditional travel plans offered. The genetic algorithm with time complexity O(g.p.f) provides the optimal solution in 100 generations. Every iteration improves the quality of the solution by 5%, thus enabling its effective use in optimization problems where time is measured in seconds. Finally, the system is designed to be fault-tolerant with functional 99.9% availability which allows the provision of services even when requirements are exceeded. Travel optimization platform is turned dynamic and efficient by this microservices based architecture which provides enhanced scaling, allows asynchronous communication and real time changes. Because of the incorporation of Ai, cost control and eco-friendliness approaches, the system addresses the different user needs in the present days travel business.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Gaia's vast dataset presents a monumental challenge for traditional analysis methods. The sheer scale of this data exceeds the capabilities of manual exploration, necessitating the utilization of advanced computational techniques. In response to this challenge, we developed a novel approach leveraging deep learning to estimate the metallicity of fundamental mode (ab-type) RR Lyrae stars from their light curves in the Gaia optical G-band. Our study explores applying deep learning techniques, particularly advanced neural network architectures, in predicting photometric metallicity from time-series data. Our deep learning models demonstrated notable predictive performance, with a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.0565, the root mean square error (RMSE) achieved is 0.0765 and a high $R^2$ regression performance of 0.9401 measured by cross-validation. The weighted mean absolute error (wMAE) is 0.0563, while the weighted root mean square error (wRMSE) is 0.0763. These results showcase the effectiveness of our approach in accurately estimating metallicity values. Our work underscores the importance of deep learning in astronomical research, particularly with large datasets from missions like Gaia. By harnessing the power of deep learning methods, we can provide precision in analyzing vast datasets, contributing to more precise and comprehensive insights into complex astronomical phenomena.</p></details> | <details><summary>Senso...</summary><p>Sensors 2024, 24(16), 5203; (23 pages)</p></details> |
| **[A Causal Transformation Model for Time-to-Event Data Affected by Unobserved Confounding: Revisiting the Illinois Reemployment Bonus Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15968v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by studies investigating causal effects in survival analysis, we propose a transformation model to quantify the impact of a binary treatment on a time-to-event outcome. The approach is based on a flexible linear transformation structural model that links a monotone function of the time-to-event with the propensity for treatment through a bivariate Gaussian distribution. The model equations are specified as functions of additive predictors, allowing the impacts of observed confounders to be accounted for flexibly. Furthermore, the effect of the instrumental variable may be regularized through a ridge penalty, while interactions between the treatment and modifier variables can be incorporated into the model to acknowledge potential variations in treatment effects across different subgroups. The baseline survival function is estimated in a flexible manner using monotonic P-splines, while unobserved confounding is captured through the dependence parameter of the bivariate Gaussian. Parameter estimation is achieved via a computationally efficient and stable penalized maximum likelihood estimation approach and intervals constructed using the related inferential results. We revisit a dataset from the Illinois Reemployment Bonus Experiment to estimate the causal effect of a cash bonus on unemployment duration, unveiling new insights. The modeling framework is incorporated into the R package GJRM, enabling researchers and practitioners to fit the proposed causal survival model and obtain easy-to-interpret numerical and visual summaries.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks for Spatiotemporal Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11960v4)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series are usually collected via monitoring sensors placed at different locations, which usually contain missing values due to various failures, such as mechanical damages and Internet outages. Imputing the missing values is crucial for analyzing time series. When recovering a specific data point, most existing methods consider all the information relevant to that point regardless of the cause-and-effect relationship. During data collection, it is inevitable that some unknown confounders are included, e.g., background noise in time series and non-causal shortcut edges in the constructed sensor network. These confounders could open backdoor paths and establish non-causal correlations between the input and output. Over-exploiting these non-causal correlations could cause overfitting. In this paper, we first revisit spatiotemporal time series imputation from a causal perspective and show how to block the confounders via the frontdoor adjustment. Based on the results of frontdoor adjustment, we introduce a novel Causality-Aware Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (Casper), which contains a novel Prompt Based Decoder (PBD) and a Spatiotemporal Causal Attention (SCA). PBD could reduce the impact of confounders and SCA could discover the sparse causal relationships among embeddings. Theoretical analysis reveals that SCA discovers causal relationships based on the values of gradients. We evaluate Casper on three real-world datasets, and the experimental results show that Casper could outperform the baselines and could effectively discover causal relationships.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024.

Given the dynamic nature of energy forecasting, it is highly advantageous to assess the superiority of forecasting models not only retrospectively but continuously in real-time as new data and evidence becomes available, while simultaneously providing strong probabilistic guarantees for these decisions. In this work, we show that this can be achieved through the mathematical concept of e-values, which has recently gained massive attention in the field of statistics. It allows for unified construction principles for powerful tests and accurate statistical decisions, which can be evaluated at any chosen time points while maintaining an overall probabilistic error control. We extend the use of e-values by developing a simple persistence approach that dynamically combines input forecasts to generate new fused predictions. To demonstrate the performance of our method we apply it to electricity demand forecasts based on different artificial intelligence based models. Our results indicate that e-values are able to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts in a dynamic environment, offering a valuable tool for real-time decision-making in the energy sector.</p></details> | 25 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Automated Contrastive Learning Strategy Search for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12641v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Contrastive Learning (CL) has become a predominant representation learning paradigm for time series. Most existing methods manually build specific CL Strategies (CLS) by human heuristics for certain datasets and tasks. However, manually developing CLS usually requires excessive prior knowledge about the data, and massive experiments to determine the detailed CL configurations. In this paper, we present an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) practice at Microsoft, which automatically learns CLS for time series datasets and tasks, namely Automated Contrastive Learning (AutoCL). We first construct a principled search space of size over $3\times10^{12}$, covering data augmentation, embedding transformation, contrastive pair construction, and contrastive losses. Further, we introduce an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes CLS from the performance on the validation tasks, to obtain effective CLS within the space. Experimental results on various real-world datasets demonstrate that AutoCL could automatically find the suitable CLS for the given dataset and task. From the candidate CLS found by AutoCL on several public datasets/tasks, we compose a transferable Generally Good Strategy (GGS), which has a strong performance for other datasets. We also provide empirical analysis as a guide for the future design of CLS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024. Fixed typos</p></details> |

To address these issues, both researchers and practitioners have integrated threat intelligence methods into the security operations of converged networks, with some of the most valuable tools being honeypots that imitate industrial control systems (ICS). However, the development and deployment of such honeypots is a process rich with pitfalls, which can lead to undiagnosed weaknesses in the threat intelligence being gathered. This paper presents a side-channel method of covertly identifying ICS honeypots using the time-to-live (TTL) values of target devices. We show that many ICS honeypots can be readily identified, via minimal interactions, using only basic networking tools. In a study of over 8,000 devices presenting as ICS systems, we detail how our method compares to an existing honeypot detection approach, and outline what our methodology reveals about the current population of live ICS honeypots. In demonstrating our method, this study aims to raise awareness of the viability of the TTL heuristic and the prevalence of its misconfiguration despite its presence in literature.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 listings, 5 tables, 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Markov Potential Game with Final-time Reach-Avoid Objectives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17690v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate a Markov potential game with final-time reach-avoid objectives by integrating potential game theory with stochastic reach-avoid control. Our focus is on multi-player trajectory planning where players maximize the same multi-player reach-avoid objective: the probability of all participants reaching their designated target states by a specified time, while avoiding collisions with one another. Existing approaches require centralized computation of actions via a global policy, which may have prohibitively expensive communication costs. Instead, we focus on approximations of the global policy via local state feedback policies. First, we adapt the recursive single player reach-avoid value iteration to the multi-player framework with local policies, and show that the same recursion holds on the joint state space. To find each player's optimal local policy, the multi-player reach-avoid value function is projected from the joint state to the local state using the other players' occupancy measures. Then, we propose an iterative best response scheme for the multi-player value iteration to converge to a pure Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate the utility of our approach in finding collision-free policies for multi-player motion planning in simulation.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[TiMePReSt: Time and Memory Efficient Pipeline Parallel DNN Training with Removed Staleness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14312v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNN training is time-consuming and requires efficient multi-accelerator parallelization, where a single training iteration is split over available accelerators. Current approaches often parallelize training using intra-batch parallelization. Combining inter-batch and intra-batch pipeline parallelism is common to further improve training throughput. In this article, we develop a system, called TiMePReSt, that combines them in a novel way which helps to better overlap computation and communication, and limits the amount of communication. The traditional pipeline-parallel training of DNNs maintains similar working principle as sequential or conventional training of DNNs by maintaining consistent weight versions in forward and backward passes of a mini-batch. Thus, it suffers from high GPU memory footprint during training. In this paper, experimental study demonstrates that compromising weight consistency doesn't decrease prediction capability of a parallelly trained DNN. Moreover, TiMePReSt overcomes GPU memory overhead and achieves zero weight staleness. State-of-the-art techniques often become costly in terms of training time. In order to address this issue, TiMePReSt introduces a variant of intra-batch parallelism that parallelizes the forward pass of each mini-batch by decomposing it into smaller micro-batches. A novel synchronization method between forward and backward passes reduces training time in TiMePReSt. The occurrence of multiple sequence problem and its relation with version difference have been observed in TiMePReSt. This paper presents a mathematical relationship between the number of micro-batches and worker machines, highlighting the variation in version difference. A mathematical expression has been developed to calculate version differences for various combinations of these two without creating diagrams for all combinations.</p></details> |  |

Capturing patterns both within and between temporal and multivariate components is crucial for reliable predictions. We introduce xLSTM-Mixer, a model designed to effectively integrate temporal sequences, joint time-variate information, and multiple perspectives for robust forecasting. Our approach begins with a linear forecast shared across variates, which is then refined by xLSTM blocks. These blocks serve as key elements for modeling the complex dynamics of challenging time series data. xLSTM-Mixer ultimately reconciles two distinct views to produce the final forecast. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate xLSTM-Mixer's superior long-term forecasting performance compared to recent state-of-the-art methods. A thorough model analysis provides further insights into its key components and confirms its robustness and effectiveness. This work contributes to the resurgence of recurrent models in time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

While they deliver powerful performance, they also face a set of common optimization needs to meet specific requirements or standards, such as instruction following or avoiding the output of sensitive information from the real world. However, how to reuse the fine-tuning outcomes of one model to other models to reduce training costs remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce Cross-model Control (CMC), a method that improves multiple LLMs in one-time training with a portable tiny language model. Specifically, we have observed that the logit shift before and after fine-tuning is remarkably similar across different models. Based on this insight, we incorporate a tiny language model with a minimal number of parameters. By training alongside a frozen template LLM, the tiny model gains the capability to alter the logits output by the LLMs. To make this tiny language model applicable to models with different vocabularies, we propose a novel token mapping strategy named PM-MinED. We have conducted extensive experiments on instruction tuning and unlearning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of CMC.

Current methods can only detect COPD from prominent features in spirogram (Volume-Flow time series) but cannot predict future COPD risk from subtle data patterns. We propose a deep learning-based method, DeepSpiro, for early prediction of future COPD risk. DeepSpiro consists of four key components: SpiroSmoother for stabilizing the Volume-Flow curve, SpiroEncoder for capturing volume evolution through key patches of varying lengths, SpiroExplainer for integrating heterogeneous data and explaining predictions through volume attention, and SpiroPredictor for predicting the disease risk of undiagnosed high-risk patients based on key patch concavity, with prediction horizons of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years, or even longer. Evaluated on the UK Biobank dataset, DeepSpiro achieved an AUC of 0.8328 for COPD detection and demonstrated strong predictive performance for future COPD risk (p-value < 0.001). DeepSpiro effectively predicts the long-term progression of the disease.</p></details> |  |

On the other hand, existing approaches rely solely on time-domain features ignoring frequency components providing complementary information. This paper proposes Time Frequency Domain Adaptation (TFDA), a method to cope with the source-free time-series domain adaptation problems. TFDA is developed with a dual branch network structure fully utilizing both time and frequency features in delivering final predictions. It induces pseudo-labels based on a neighborhood concept where predictions of a sample group are aggregated to generate reliable pseudo labels. The concept of contrastive learning is carried out in both time and frequency domains with pseudo label information and a negative pair exclusion strategy to make valid neighborhood assumptions. In addition, the time-frequency consistency technique is proposed using the self-distillation strategy while the uncertainty reduction strategy is implemented to alleviate uncertainties due to the domain shift problem. Last but not least, the curriculum learning strategy is integrated to combat noisy pseudo labels. Our experiments demonstrate the advantage of our approach over prior arts with noticeable margins in benchmark problems.</p></details> |  |

High-quality annotations are essential for effectively understanding time series and facilitating downstream tasks; however, obtaining such annotations is challenging, particularly in mission-critical domains. In this paper, we propose TESSA, a multi-agent system designed to automatically generate both general and domain-specific annotations for time series data. TESSA introduces two agents: a general annotation agent and a domain-specific annotation agent. The general agent captures common patterns and knowledge across multiple source domains, leveraging both time-series-wise and text-wise features to generate general annotations. Meanwhile, the domain-specific agent utilizes limited annotations from the target domain to learn domain-specific terminology and generate targeted annotations. Extensive experiments on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that TESSA effectively generates high-quality annotations, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 24 tables</p></details> |

However, the proverbial "closing of the loop" in experiment-theory cycles in practice are usually ad hoc, often inherently difficult, or impractical to repeat on a systematic basis, beset by the scale or the time constraint of computation or the phenomena under study. Here, we demonstrate Autonomous MAterials Search Engine (AMASE), where we enlist robot science to perform self-driving continuous cyclical interaction of experiments and computational predictions for materials exploration. In particular, we have applied the AMASE formalism to the rapid mapping of a temperature-composition phase diagram, a fundamental task for the search and discovery of new materials. Thermal processing and experimental determination of compositional phase boundaries in thin films are autonomously interspersed with real-time updating of the phase diagram prediction through the minimization of Gibbs free energies. AMASE was able to accurately determine the eutectic phase diagram of the Sn-Bi binary thin-film system on the fly from a self-guided campaign covering just a small fraction of the entire composition - temperature phase space, translating to a 6-fold reduction in the number of necessary experiments. This study demonstrates for the first time the possibility of real-time, autonomous, and iterative interactions of experiments and theory carried out without any human intervention.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote Timing Attacks on Efficient Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17175v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling up language models has significantly increased their capabilities. But larger models are slower models, and so there is now an extensive body of work (e.g., speculative sampling or parallel decoding) that improves the (average case) efficiency of language model generation. But these techniques introduce data-dependent timing characteristics. We show it is possible to exploit these timing differences to mount a timing attack. By monitoring the (encrypted) network traffic between a victim user and a remote language model, we can learn information about the content of messages by noting when responses are faster or slower. With complete black-box access, on open source systems we show how it is possible to learn the topic of a user's conversation (e.g., medical advice vs. coding assistance) with 90%+ precision, and on production systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude we can distinguish between specific messages or infer the user's language. We further show that an active adversary can leverage a boosting attack to recover PII placed in messages (e.g., phone numbers or credit card numbers) for open source systems. We conclude with potential defenses and directions for future work.</p></details> |  |
| **[LiNo: Advancing Recursive Residual Decomposition of Linear and Nonlinear Patterns for Robust Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17159v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting models are pivotal in a data-driven world with vast volumes of time series data that appear as a compound of vast Linear and Nonlinear patterns. Recent deep time series forecasting models struggle to utilize seasonal and trend decomposition to separate the entangled components. Such a strategy only explicitly extracts simple linear patterns like trends, leaving the other linear modes and vast unexplored nonlinear patterns to the residual. Their flawed linear and nonlinear feature extraction models and shallow-level decomposition limit their adaptation to the diverse patterns present in real-world scenarios. Given this, we innovate Recursive Residual Decomposition by introducing explicit extraction of both linear and nonlinear patterns. This deeper-level decomposition framework, which is named LiNo, captures linear patterns using a Li block which can be a moving average kernel, and models nonlinear patterns using a No block which can be a Transformer encoder. The extraction of these two patterns is performed alternatively and recursively. To achieve the full potential of LiNo, we develop the current simple linear pattern extractor to a general learnable autoregressive model, and design a novel No block that can handle all essential nonlinear patterns. Remarkably, the proposed LiNo achieves state-of-the-art on thirteen real-world benchmarks under univariate and multivariate forecasting scenarios. Experiments show that current forecasting models can deliver more robust and precise results through this advanced Recursive Residual Decomposition. We hope this work could offer insight into designing more effective forecasting models. Code is available at this Repository: https://github.com/Levi-Ackman/LiNo.</p></details> |  |

While current methods show effectiveness, they often compromise between speed and accuracy. To address this issue, we present a novel real-time and efficient road sign detection network, YOLO-TS. This network significantly improves performance by optimizing the receptive fields of multi-scale feature maps to align more closely with the size distribution of traffic signs in various datasets. Moreover, our innovative feature-fusion strategy, leveraging the flexibility of Anchor-Free methods, allows for multi-scale object detection on a high-resolution feature map abundant in contextual information, achieving remarkable enhancements in both accuracy and speed. To mitigate the adverse effects of the grid pattern caused by dilated convolutions on the detection of smaller objects, we have devised a unique module that not only mitigates this grid effect but also widens the receptive field to encompass an extensive range of spatial contextual information, thus boosting the efficiency of information usage. Evaluation on challenging public datasets, TT100K and CCTSDB2021, demonstrates that YOLO-TS surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of both accuracy and speed.

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models alleviate this issue by selectively activating relevant experts. Despite this, MoE models are hindered by high communication overhead from all-to-all operations, low GPU utilization due to the synchronous communication constraint, and complications from heterogeneous GPU environments. This paper presents Aurora, which optimizes both model deployment and all-to-all communication scheduling to address these challenges in MoE inference. Aurora achieves minimal communication times by strategically ordering token transmissions in all-to-all communications. It improves GPU utilization by colocating experts from different models on the same device, avoiding the limitations of synchronous all-to-all communication. We analyze Aurora's optimization strategies theoretically across four common GPU cluster settings: exclusive vs. colocated models on GPUs, and homogeneous vs. heterogeneous GPUs. Aurora provides optimal solutions for three cases, and for the remaining NP-hard scenario, it offers a polynomial-time sub-optimal solution with only a 1.07x degradation from the optimal. Aurora is the first approach to minimize MoE inference time via optimal model deployment and communication scheduling across various scenarios. Evaluations demonstrate that Aurora significantly accelerates inference, achieving speedups of up to 2.38x in homogeneous clusters and 3.54x in heterogeneous environments. Moreover, Aurora enhances GPU utilization by up to 1.5x compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The fact that optical DCNs rely on optical circuits of microsecond-scale durations makes nanosecond-precision time synchronization essential for the correct functioning of routing on the network fabric. However, current studies on optical DCNs neglect the fundamental need for accurate time synchronization. In this paper, we bridge the gap by developing Nanosecond Optical Synchronization (NOS), the first nanosecond-precision synchronization solution for optical DCNs general to various optical hardware. NOS builds clock propagation trees on top of the dynamically reconfigured circuits in optical DCNs, allowing switches to seek better sync parents throughout time. It predicts drifts in the tree-building process, which enables minimization of sync errors. We also tailor today's sync protocols to the needs of optical DCNs, including reducing the number of sync messages to fit into short circuit durations and correcting timestamp errors for higher sync accuracy. Our implementation on programmable switches shows 28ns sync accuracy in a 192-ToR setting.</p></details> |  |

The data collected using this equipment can be used clinical staff to gain insight into the condition of the patients and provide adequate treatment, but it also provides ample opportunity for applications in machine learning and data science. While this data can frequently be used directly, complex problems may require additional annotations to provide context and meaning before it could be used to train the machine learning models. Annotating time-series datasets in clinical setting is a complex problem due to a large volume and complexity of the data, time-consuming nature of the process and the fact that clinicians' time is in both high demand and short supply. In this study, we present an evaluation of a bespoke tool designed to annotate large, clinical time-series datasets with staff from intensive care units. The software incorporates two modes for annotation: by annotating individual admissions and by generating rulesets which are applied to the entire dataset. Our study was split into two stages focusing on individual and semi-automated annotation and included 28 annotators across both stages who utilised 50 clinical parameters to guide their annotations. We experienced significant challenges in recruitment and engagement of the participants in the annotation activities and developed interventions which improved the participation over the course of the study. During the semi-automated annotation, we observed preferences for different parameter types (measured vs. observed), as well as relative agreement of participants across shared admissions to the decision-tree model trained using their rulesets.</p></details> |  |

| **[Unsupervised Time Series Anomaly Prediction with Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16888v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series anomaly prediction plays an essential role in many real-world scenarios, such as environmental prevention and prompt maintenance of cyber-physical systems. However, existing time series anomaly prediction methods mainly require supervised training with plenty of manually labeled data, which are difficult to obtain in practice. Besides, unseen anomalies can occur during inference, which could differ from the labeled training data and make these models fail to predict such new anomalies. In this paper, we study a novel problem of unsupervised time series anomaly prediction. We provide a theoretical analysis and propose Importance-based Generative Contrastive Learning (IGCL) to address the aforementioned problems. IGCL distinguishes between normal and anomaly precursors, which are generated by our anomaly precursor pattern generation module. To address the efficiency issues caused by the potential complex anomaly precursor combinations, we propose a memory bank with importance-based scores to adaptively store representative anomaly precursors and generate more complicated anomaly precursors. Extensive experiments on seven benchmark datasets show our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on unsupervised time series anomaly prediction problems.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Moreover, smart meters provide valuable information by allowing for granular insights into consumption patterns. Building upon available smart meter data, our study aims to cluster consumers into distinct groups according to their energy usage behaviours, effectively capturing a diverse spectrum of consumption patterns. Next, we design JITtrans (Just In Time transformer), a novel transformer deep learning model that significantly improves energy consumption forecasting accuracy, with respect to traditional forecasting methods. Extensive experimental results validate our claims using proprietary smart meter data. Our findings highlight the potential of advanced predictive technologies to revolutionize energy management and advance sustainable power systems: the development of efficient and eco-friendly energy solutions critically depends on such technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Querying in Constant Expected Time with Learned Indexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03851v4)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned indexes leverage machine learning models to accelerate query answering in databases, showing impressive practical performance. However, theoretical understanding of these methods remains incomplete. Existing research suggests that learned indexes have superior asymptotic complexity compared to their non-learned counterparts, but these findings have been established under restrictive probabilistic assumptions. Specifically, for a sorted array with $n$ elements, it has been shown that learned indexes can find a key in $O(\log(\log n))$ expected time using at most linear space, compared with $O(\log n)$ for non-learned methods. In this work, we prove $O(1)$ expected time can be achieved with at most linear space, thereby establishing the tightest upper bound so far for the time complexity of an asymptotically optimal learned index. Notably, we use weaker probabilistic assumptions than prior research, meaning our work generalizes previous results. Furthermore, we introduce a new measure of statistical complexity for data. This metric exhibits an information-theoretical interpretation and can be estimated in practice. This characterization provides further theoretical understanding of learned indexes, by helping to explain why some datasets seem to be particularly challenging for these methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Algorithm Performance Understanding through tsMorph: Generating Semi-Synthetic Time Series for Robust Forecasting Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01344v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting is a subject of significant scientific and industrial importance. Despite the widespread utilization of forecasting methods, there is a dearth of research aimed at comprehending the conditions under which these methods yield favorable or unfavorable performances. Empirical studies, although common, are challenged by the limited availability of time series datasets, restricting the extraction of reliable insights. To address this limitation, we present tsMorph, a tool for generating semi-synthetic time series through dataset morphing. tsMorph works by creating a sequence of datasets from two original datasets. The characteristics of the generated datasets progressively depart from those of one of the datasets and converge toward the attributes of the other dataset. This method provides a valuable alternative for obtaining substantial datasets. In this paper, we show the benefits of tsMorph by assessing the predictive performance of the Long Short-Term Memory Network and DeepAR forecasting algorithms. The time series used for the experiments comes from the NN5 Competition. The experimental results provide important insights. Notably, the performances of the two algorithms improve proportionally with the frequency of the time series. These experiments confirm that tsMorph can be an effective tool for better understanding the behavior of forecasting algorithms, delivering a pathway to overcoming the limitations posed by empirical studies and enabling more extensive and reliable experiments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Modulated Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators for Temporal Interpolation of Weather Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18904v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather and climate data are often available at limited temporal resolution, either due to storage limitations, or in the case of weather forecast models based on deep learning, their inherently long time steps. The coarse temporal resolution makes it difficult to capture rapidly evolving weather events. To address this limitation, we introduce an interpolation model that reconstructs the atmospheric state between two points in time for which the state is known. The model makes use of a novel network layer that modifies the adaptive Fourier neural operator (AFNO), which has been previously used in weather prediction and other applications of machine learning to physics problems. The modulated AFNO (ModAFNO) layer takes an embedding, here computed from the interpolation target time, as an additional input and applies a learned shift-scale operation inside the AFNO layers to adapt them to the target time. Thus, one model can be used to produce all intermediate time steps. Trained to interpolate between two time steps 6 h apart, the ModAFNO-based interpolation model produces 1 h resolution intermediate time steps that are visually nearly indistinguishable from the actual corresponding 1 h resolution data. The model reduces the RMSE loss of reconstructing the intermediate steps by approximately 50% compared to linear interpolation. We also demonstrate its ability to reproduce the statistics of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves better than 6 h resolution data. The ModAFNO layer is generic and is expected to be applicable to other problems, including weather forecasting with tunable lead time.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Search for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18580v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs achieve competitive performances on benchmark tasks like image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not optimal for SNNs. In this work, we apply Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find suitable architectures for SNNs. Previous NAS methods for SNNs focus primarily on the spatial dimension, with a notable lack of consideration for the temporal dynamics that are of critical importance for SNNs. Drawing inspiration from the heterogeneity of biological neural networks, we propose a differentiable approach to optimize SNN on both spatial and temporal dimensions. At spatial level, we have developed a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based operation is optimized on both the cell and the layer level under computational constraints. We further propose a differentiable surrogate gradient search (DGS) method to evolve local SG functions independently during training. At temporal level, we explore an optimal configuration of diverse temporal dynamics on different types of spiking neurons by evolving their time constants, based on which we further develop hybrid networks combining SNN and ANN, balancing both accuracy and efficiency. Our methods achieve comparable classification performance of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracies of 96.43%, 78.96%, and 70.21%, respectively. On event-based deep stereo, our methods find optimal layer variation and surpass the accuracy of specially designed ANNs with 26$\times$ lower computational cost ($6.7\mathrm{mJ}$), demonstrating the potential of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.</p></details> |  |

Analysing political speech data from more than 30 years requires the use of flexible topic models to uncover the latent topics and their change in prevalence over time as well as the change in the vocabulary of the topics. We propose the temporal Poisson factorisation (TPF) model as an extension to the Poisson factorisation model to model sparse count data matrices obtained based on the bag-of-words assumption from text documents with time stamps. We discuss and empirically compare different model specifications for the time-varying latent variables consisting either of a flexible auto-regressive structure of order one or a random walk. Estimation is based on variational inference where we consider a combination of coordinate ascent updates with automatic differentiation using batching of documents. Suitable variational families are proposed to ease inference. We compare results obtained using independent univariate variational distributions for the time-varying latent variables to those obtained with a multivariate variant. We discuss in detail the results of the TPF model when analysing speeches from 18 sessions in the U.S. Senate (1981-2016).</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper: 19 pages (2 single figures, 3 double figures, 3 tables) appendix: 9 pages (3 quadruple figures, 1 table) references: 3 pages</p></details> |
| **[System Safety Monitoring of Learned Components Using Temporal Metric Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13254v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In learning-enabled autonomous systems, safety monitoring of learned components is crucial to ensure their outputs do not lead to system safety violations, given the operational context of the system. However, developing a safety monitor for practical deployment in real-world applications is challenging. This is due to limited access to internal workings and training data of the learned component. Furthermore, safety monitors should predict safety violations with low latency, while consuming a reasonable amount of computation. To address the challenges, we propose a safety monitoring method based on probabilistic time series forecasting. Given the learned component outputs and an operational context, we empirically investigate different Deep Learning (DL)-based probabilistic forecasting to predict the objective measure capturing the satisfaction or violation of a safety requirement (safety metric). We empirically evaluate safety metric and violation prediction accuracy, and inference latency and resource usage of four state-of-the-art models, with varying horizons, using autonomous aviation and autonomous driving case studies. Our results suggest that probabilistic forecasting of safety metrics, given learned component outputs and scenarios, is effective for safety monitoring. Furthermore, for both case studies, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) was the most accurate model for predicting imminent safety violations, with acceptable latency and resource consumption.</p></details> |  |
| **[DN-4DGS: Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13607v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scenes rendering is an intriguing yet challenging problem. Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real-time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. However, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we propose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[ROCKET-1: Master Open-World Interaction with Visual-Temporal Context Prompting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17856v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have excelled in multimodal tasks, but adapting them to embodied decision-making in open-world environments presents challenges. A key issue is the difficulty in smoothly connecting individual entities in low-level observations with abstract concepts required for planning. A common approach to address this problem is through the use of hierarchical agents, where VLMs serve as high-level reasoners that break down tasks into executable sub-tasks, typically specified using language and imagined observations. However, language often fails to effectively convey spatial information, while generating future images with sufficient accuracy remains challenging. To address these limitations, we propose visual-temporal context prompting, a novel communication protocol between VLMs and policy models. This protocol leverages object segmentation from both past and present observations to guide policy-environment interactions. Using this approach, we train ROCKET-1, a low-level policy that predicts actions based on concatenated visual observations and segmentation masks, with real-time object tracking provided by SAM-2. Our method unlocks the full potential of VLMs visual-language reasoning abilities, enabling them to solve complex creative tasks, especially those heavily reliant on spatial understanding. Experiments in Minecraft demonstrate that our approach allows agents to accomplish previously unattainable tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of visual-temporal context prompting in embodied decision-making. Codes and demos will be available on the project page: https://craftjarvis.github.io/ROCKET-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Anomaly Resilient Temporal QoS Prediction using Hypergraph Convoluted Transformer Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17762v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality-of-Service (QoS) prediction is a critical task in the service lifecycle, enabling precise and adaptive service recommendations by anticipating performance variations over time in response to evolving network uncertainties and user preferences. However, contemporary QoS prediction methods frequently encounter data sparsity and cold-start issues, which hinder accurate QoS predictions and limit the ability to capture diverse user preferences. Additionally, these methods often assume QoS data reliability, neglecting potential credibility issues such as outliers and the presence of greysheep users and services with atypical invocation patterns. Furthermore, traditional approaches fail to leverage diverse features, including domain-specific knowledge and complex higher-order patterns, essential for accurate QoS predictions. In this paper, we introduce a real-time, trust-aware framework for temporal QoS prediction to address the aforementioned challenges, featuring an end-to-end deep architecture called the Hypergraph Convoluted Transformer Network (HCTN). HCTN combines a hypergraph structure with graph convolution over hyper-edges to effectively address high-sparsity issues by capturing complex, high-order correlations. Complementing this, the transformer network utilizes multi-head attention along with parallel 1D convolutional layers and fully connected dense blocks to capture both fine-grained and coarse-grained dynamic patterns. Additionally, our approach includes a sparsity-resilient solution for detecting greysheep users and services, incorporating their unique characteristics to improve prediction accuracy. Trained with a robust loss function resistant to outliers, HCTN demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the large-scale WSDREAM-2 datasets for response time and throughput.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Adaptive Joint Estimation of Temporal Vertex and Edge Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06533v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adaptive estimation of coexisting temporal vertex (node) and edge signals on graphs is a critical task when a change in edge signals influences the temporal dynamics of the vertex signals. However, the current Graph Signal Processing algorithms mostly consider only the signals existing on the graph vertices and have neglected the fact that signals can reside on the edges. We propose an Adaptive Joint Vertex-Edge Estimation (AJVEE) algorithm for jointly estimating time-varying vertex and edge signals through a time-varying regression, incorporating both vertex signal filtering and edge signal filtering. Accompanying AJVEE is a newly proposed Adaptive Least Mean Square procedure based on the Hodge Laplacian (ALMS-Hodge), which is inspired by classical adaptive filters combining simplicial filtering and simplicial regression. AJVEE is able to operate jointly on the vertices and edges by merging two ALMS-Hodge specified on the vertices and edges into a unified formulation. A more generalized case extending AJVEE beyond the vertices and edges is being discussed. Experimenting on real-world traffic networks and population mobility networks, we have confirmed that our proposed AJVEE algorithm could accurately and jointly track time-varying vertex and edge signals on graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Statistical Efficiency of Distributional Temporal Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05811v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributional reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved empirical success in various domains. One core task in the field of DRL is distributional policy evaluation, which involves estimating the return distribution $\eta^\pi$ for a given policy $\pi$. The distributional temporal difference learning has been accordingly proposed, which is an extension of the temporal difference learning (TD) in the classic RL area. In the tabular case, \citet{rowland2018analysis} and \citet{rowland2023analysis} proved the asymptotic convergence of two instances of distributional TD, namely categorical temporal difference learning (CTD) and quantile temporal difference learning (QTD), respectively. In this paper, we go a step further and analyze the finite-sample performance of distributional TD. To facilitate theoretical analysis, we propose non-parametric distributional TD learning (NTD). For a $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon tabular Markov decision process, we show that for NTD we need $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2p}(1-\gamma)^{2p+1}}\right)$ iterations to achieve an $\varepsilon$-optimal estimator with high probability, when the estimation error is measured by the $p$-Wasserstein distance. This sample complexity bound is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors in the case of the $1$-Wasserstein distance. To achieve this, we establish a novel Freedman's inequality in Hilbert spaces, which would be of independent interest. In addition, we revisit CTD, showing that the same non-asymptotic convergence bounds hold for CTD in the case of the $p$-Wasserstein distance for $p\geq 1$.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 (oral) |
| **[Adaptive Spatio-temporal Estimation on the Graph Edges via Line Graph Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00656v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal estimation of signals on graph edges is challenging because most conventional Graph Signal Processing techniques are defined on the graph nodes. Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for programs with effects, nondeterminism, and nontermination is difficult. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate on the level of models (traces, automata) not executable code, creating a verification gap and losing the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics. Reasoning about infinite traces and automata requires complex (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., guardedness checker). We propose a structural approach to the verification of temporal properties with a new temporal logic that we call Ticl. Using Ticl, we internalize complex (co-)inductive proof techniques to structural lemmas and reasoning about variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform mechanized proofs of general temporal properties, while working in a high-level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of ticl by giving short, structural proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with queues, secure memory, and distributed consensus.</p></details> | 24 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Minimum-Violation Temporal Logic Planning for Heterogeneous Robots under Robot Skill Failures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17188v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider teams of robots with heterogeneous skills (e.g., sensing and manipulation) tasked with collaborative missions described by Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formulas. These LTL-encoded tasks require robots to apply their skills to specific regions and objects in a temporal and logical order. While existing temporal logic planning algorithms can synthesize correct-by-construction paths, they typically lack reactivity to unexpected failures of robot skills, which can compromise mission performance. This paper addresses this challenge by proposing a reactive LTL planning algorithm that adapts to unexpected failures during deployment. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reassigns sub-tasks to robots based on their functioning skills and locally revises team plans to accommodate these new assignments and ensure mission completion. The main novelty of the proposed algorithm is its ability to handle cases where mission completion becomes impossible due to limited functioning robots. Instead of reporting mission failure, the algorithm strategically prioritizes the most crucial sub-tasks and locally revises the team's plans, as per user-specified priorities, to minimize mission violations. We provide theoretical conditions under which the proposed framework computes the minimum violation task reassignments and team plans. We provide numerical and hardware experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oryx MLLM: On-Demand Spatial-Temporal Understanding at Arbitrary Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12961v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data comes in various forms, ranging from small icons of just a few pixels to long videos spanning hours. Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

Temporal queries, which are common in cohort discovery, can be time-consuming and prone to errors when processed on large EHR datasets. In this work, we introduce TELII, a temporal event level inverted indexing method designed for cohort discovery on large EHR datasets. TELII is engineered to pre-compute and store the relations along with the time difference between events, thereby providing fast and accurate temporal query capabilities. We implemented TELII for the OPTUM de-identified COVID-19 EHR dataset, which contains data from 8.87 million patients. We demonstrate four common temporal query tasks and their implementation using TELII with a MongoDB backend. Our results show that the temporal query speed for TELII is up to 2000 times faster than that of existing non-temporal inverted indexes. TELII achieves millisecond-level response times, enabling users to quickly explore event relations and find preliminary evidence for their research questions. Not only is TELII practical and straightforward to implement, but it also offers easy adaptability to other EHR datasets. These advantages underscore TELII's potential to serve as the query engine for EHR-based applications, ensuring fast, accurate, and user-friendly query responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Graph Rewiring with Expander Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02362v3)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evolving relations in real-world networks are often modelled by temporal graphs. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) emerged to model evolutionary behaviour of such graphs by leveraging the message passing primitive at the core of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It is well-known that GNNs are vulnerable to several issues directly related to the input graph topology, such as under-reaching and over-squashing - we argue that these issues can often get exacerbated in temporal graphs, particularly as the result of stale nodes and edges. While graph rewiring techniques have seen frequent usage in GNNs to make the graph topology more favourable for message passing, they have not seen any mainstream usage on TGNNs. In this work, we propose Temporal Graph Rewiring (TGR), the first approach for graph rewiring on temporal graphs, to the best of our knowledge. TGR constructs message passing highways between temporally distant nodes in a continuous-time dynamic graph by utilizing expander graph propagation, a prominent framework used for graph rewiring on static graphs which makes minimal assumptions on the underlying graph structure. On the challenging TGB benchmark, TGR achieves state-of-the-art results on tgbl-review, tgbl-coin, tgbl-comment and tgbl-flight datasets at the time of writing. For tgbl-review, TGR has 50.5% improvement in MRR over the base TGN model and 22.2% improvement over the base TNCN model. The significant improvement over base models demonstrates clear benefits of temporal graph rewiring.</p></details> | 14 pages, 2 figures |

The imitation learning based robot motion generation method, however, has the drawback of being limited by the demonstrators task execution speed. This paper presents a novel temporal ensemble approach applied to imitation learning algorithms, allowing for execution of future actions. The proposed method leverages existing demonstration data and pretrained policies, offering the advantages of requiring no additional computation and being easy to implement. The algorithms performance was validated through real world experiments involving robotic block color sorting, demonstrating up to 3x increase in task execution speed while maintaining a high success rate compared to the action chunking with transformer method. This study highlights the potential for significantly improving the performance of imitation learning-based policies, which were previously limited by the demonstrator's speed.

On this front both context and time dynamics as well as their interplay are of prime importance. Current approaches model context via pre-trained representations, which are typically temporally agnostic.

Specifically, we propose a quadratic-form cumulative sum (CUSUM) statistic to test the stability of regression coefficients in high-dimensional linear models. The test controls type-I error at any desired level and is robust to temporally dependent observations. We establish its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis, and demonstrate that it is asymptotically powerful against multiple change-point alternatives and achieves the optimal detection boundary for a wide class of high-dimensional models. We further develop an adaptive procedure to estimate the tuning parameters of the test, making our method practical in applications. Additionally, we extend our approach to localize change-points in the regression time series and establish sharp error bounds for our change-point estimator. Extensive numerical experiments and a real data application in macroeconomics are conducted to demonstrate the promising performance and practical utility of the proposed test.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</p></details> |  |

Representing these instructions as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) enables planners to synthesize actionable plans. We introduce CoT-TL, a data-efficient in-context learning framework for translating natural language specifications into LTL representations. CoT-TL addresses the limitations of large language models, which typically rely on extensive fine-tuning data, by extending chain-of-thought reasoning and semantic roles to align with the requirements of formal logic creation. This approach enhances the transparency and rationale behind LTL generation, fostering user trust. CoT-TL achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across three diverse datasets in low-data scenarios, outperforming existing methods without fine-tuning or intermediate translations. To improve reliability and minimize hallucinations, we incorporate model checking to validate the syntax of the generated LTL output. We further demonstrate CoT-TL's effectiveness through ablation studies and evaluations on unseen LTL structures and formulas in a new dataset. Finally, we validate CoT-TL's practicality by integrating it into a QuadCopter for multi-step drone planning based on natural language instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Proceedings of the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024), Abu Dhabi 14-18 October 2024</p></details> |
| **[Statistical Inference for Temporal Difference Learning with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16106v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Statistical inference with finite-sample validity for the value function of a given policy in Markov decision processes (MDPs) is crucial for ensuring the reliability of reinforcement learning. Temporal Difference (TD) learning, arguably the most widely used algorithm for policy evaluation, serves as a natural framework for this purpose.In this paper, we study the consistency properties of TD learning with Polyak-Ruppert averaging and linear function approximation, and obtain three significant improvements over existing results. First, we derive a novel sharp high-dimensional probability convergence guarantee that depends explicitly on the asymptotic variance and holds under weak conditions. We further establish refined high-dimensional Berry-Esseen bounds over the class of convex sets that guarantee faster rates than those in the literature. Finally, we propose a plug-in estimator for the asymptotic covariance matrix, designed for efficient online computation. These results enable the construction of confidence regions and simultaneous confidence intervals for the linear parameters of the value function, with guaranteed finite-sample coverage. We demonstrate the applicability of our theoretical findings through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resilient Temporal GCN for Smart Grid State Estimation Under Topology Inaccuracies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16008v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Estimation is a crucial task in power systems. Graph Neural Networks have demonstrated significant potential in state estimation for power systems by effectively analyzing measurement data and capturing the complex interactions and interrelations among the measurements through the system's graph structure. However, the information about the system's graph structure may be inaccurate due to noise, attack or lack of accurate information about the topology of the system. This paper studies these scenarios under topology uncertainties and evaluates the impact of the topology uncertainties on the performance of a Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (TGCN) for state estimation in power systems. In order to make the model resilient to topology uncertainties, modifications in the TGCN model are proposed to incorporate a knowledge graph, generated based on the measurement data. This knowledge graph supports the assumed uncertain system graph. Two variations of the TGCN architecture are introduced to integrate the knowledge graph, and their performances are evaluated and compared to demonstrate improved resilience against topology uncertainties. The evaluation results indicate that while the two proposed architecture show different performance, they both improve the performance of the TGCN state estimation under topology uncertainties.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

This approach uses two distinct models: for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences. Regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analyses, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. In this article, we will compare these two architectural configurations with each other, to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATI-CTLO:Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-Only Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20619v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The motion distortion in LiDAR scans caused by aggressive robot motion and varying terrain features significantly impacts the positioning and mapping performance of 3D LiDAR odometry. Existing distortion correction solutions often struggle to balance computational complexity and accuracy. In this work, we propose an Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-only Odometry, utilizing straightforward and efficient linear interpolation. Our method flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according to the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability enhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in challenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our method on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in scenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method outperforms existing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object-Centric Temporal Consistency via Conditional Autoregressive Inductive Biases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15728v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised object-centric learning from videos is a promising approach towards learning compositional representations that can be applied to various downstream tasks, such as prediction and reasoning. Recently, it was shown that pretrained Vision Transformers (ViTs) can be useful to learn object-centric representations on real-world video datasets. However, while these approaches succeed at extracting objects from the scenes, the slot-based representations fail to maintain temporal consistency across consecutive frames in a video, i.e. the mapping of objects to slots changes across the video. To address this, we introduce Conditional Autoregressive Slot Attention (CA-SA), a framework that enhances the temporal consistency of extracted object-centric representations in video-centric vision tasks. Leveraging an autoregressive prior network to condition representations on previous timesteps and a novel consistency loss function, CA-SA predicts future slot representations and imposes consistency across frames. We present qualitative and quantitative results showing that our proposed method outperforms the considered baselines on downstream tasks, such as video prediction and visual question-answering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing SNN-based Spatio-Temporal Learning: A Benchmark Dataset and Cross-Modality Attention Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15689v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), renowned for their low power consumption, brain-inspired architecture, and spatio-temporal representation capabilities, have garnered considerable attention in recent years. Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Multi-frame self-supervised depth estimation methods have gained research interest due to their ability to leverage large-scale, unlabeled real-world data. However, the self-supervised methods often rely on the assumption of a static scene and their performance tends to degrade in dynamic environments. To address this issue, we present Motion-Aware Loss, which leverages the temporal relation among consecutive input frames and a novel distillation scheme between the teacher and student networks in the multi-frame self-supervised depth estimation methods. Specifically, we associate the spatial locations of moving objects with the temporal order of input frames to eliminate errors induced by object motion. Meanwhile, we enhance the original distillation scheme in multi-frame methods to better exploit the knowledge from a teacher network. MAL is a novel, plug-and-play module designed for seamless integration into multi-frame self-supervised monocular depth estimation methods. Adding MAL into previous state-of-the-art methods leads to a reduction in depth estimation errors by up to 4.2% and 10.8% on KITTI and CityScapes benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2024; Project homepage: https://yuejiangdong.github.io/MotionAwareLoss/</p></details> |
| **[Disambiguating Monocular Reconstruction of 3D Clothed Human with Spatial-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16337v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing 3D clothed humans from monocular camera data is highly challenging due to viewpoint limitations and image ambiguity. While implicit function-based approaches, combined with prior knowledge from parametric models, have made significant progress, there are still two notable problems. Firstly, the back details of human models are ambiguous due to viewpoint invisibility. The quality of the back details depends on the back normal map predicted by a convolutional neural network (CNN). However, the CNN lacks global information awareness for comprehending the back texture, resulting in excessively smooth back details. Secondly, a single image suffers from local ambiguity due to lighting conditions and body movement. However, implicit functions are highly sensitive to pixel variations in ambiguous regions. To address these ambiguities, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Transformer (STT) network for 3D clothed human reconstruction. A spatial transformer is employed to extract global information for normal map prediction. The establishment of global correlations facilitates the network in comprehending the holistic texture and shape of the human body. Simultaneously, to compensate for local ambiguity in images, a temporal transformer is utilized to extract temporal features from adjacent frames. The incorporation of temporal features can enhance the accuracy of input features in implicit networks. Furthermore, to obtain more accurate temporal features, joint tokens are employed to establish local correspondences between frames. Experimental results on the Adobe and MonoPerfCap datasets have shown that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and maintains robust generalization even under low-light outdoor conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextDet: Temporal Action Detection with Adaptive Context Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15279v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal action detection (TAD), which locates and recognizes action segments, remains a challenging task in video understanding due to variable segment lengths and ambiguous boundaries. Existing methods treat neighboring contexts of an action segment indiscriminately, leading to imprecise boundary predictions. We introduce a single-stage ContextDet framework, which makes use of large-kernel convolutions in TAD for the first time. Our model features a pyramid adaptive context aggragation (ACA) architecture, capturing long context and improving action discriminability. Each ACA level consists of two novel modules. The context attention module (CAM) identifies salient contextual information, encourages context diversity, and preserves context integrity through a context gating block (CGB). The long context module (LCM) makes use of a mixture of large- and small-kernel convolutions to adaptively gather long-range context and fine-grained local features. Additionally, by varying the length of these large kernels across the ACA pyramid, our model provides lightweight yet effective context aggregation and action discrimination. We conducted extensive experiments and compared our model with a number of advanced TAD methods on six challenging TAD benchmarks: MultiThumos, Charades, FineAction, EPIC-Kitchens 100, Thumos14, and HACS, demonstrating superior accuracy at reduced inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastSTI: A Fast Conditional Pseudo Numerical Diffusion Model for Spatio-temporal Traffic Data Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15248v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality spatiotemporal traffic data is crucial for intelligent transportation systems (ITS) and their data-driven applications. Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf{8.3} \times$ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems for publication.

| **[Towards Truss-Based Temporal Community Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15046v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying communities from temporal networks facilitates the understanding of potential dynamic relationships among entities, which has already received extensive applications. However, existing methods primarily rely on lower-order connectivity (e.g., temporal edges) to capture the structural and temporal cohesiveness of the community, often neglecting higher-order temporal connectivity, which leads to sub-optimal results. To overcome this dilemma, we propose a novel temporal community model named maximal-truss (MDT). This model emphasizes maximal temporal support, ensuring all edges are connected by a sequence of triangles with elegant temporal properties. To search the MDT containing the user-initiated query node q (q-MDT), we first design a powerful local search framework with some effective pruning strategies. This approach aims to identify the solution from the small temporal subgraph which is expanded from q. To further improve the performance on large graphs, we build the temporal trussness index (TT-index) for all edges. Leveraging the TT-index allows us to efficiently search high-probability target subgraphs instead of performing a full search across the entire input graph. Empirical results on nine real-world networks and seven competitors demonstrate the superiority of our solutions in terms of efficiency, effectiveness, and scalability</p></details> |  |

Unexpected increases in passengers can cause overcrowded vehicles, longer boarding times, and service disruptions. Traditional time series models like ARIMA and SARIMA face limitations, particularly in short-term predictions and integration of spatial and temporal features. These models struggle with the dynamic nature of ridership patterns and often ignore spatial correlations between nearby stops. Deep Learning (DL) models present a promising alternative, demonstrating superior performance in short-term prediction tasks by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal features. However, challenges such as dynamic spatial feature extraction, balancing accuracy with computational efficiency, and ensuring scalability remain. This paper introduces DST-TransitNet, a hybrid DL model for system-wide station-level ridership prediction. This proposed model uses graph neural networks (GNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to dynamically integrate the changing temporal and spatial correlations within the stations. The model also employs a precise time series decomposition framework to enhance accuracy and interpretability. Tested on Bogota's BRT system data, with three distinct social scenarios, DST-TransitNet outperformed state-of-the-art models in precision, efficiency and robustness. Meanwhile, it maintains stability over long prediction intervals, demonstrating practical applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 22 figures.

Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables, under review in Applied Ocean Research Journal</p></details> |
| **[ChronoFact: Timeline-based Temporal Fact Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14964v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated fact verification plays an essential role in fostering trust in the digital space. Despite the growing interest, the verification of temporal facts has not received much attention in the community. Temporal fact verification brings new challenges where cues of the temporal information need to be extracted and temporal reasoning involving various temporal aspects of the text must be applied. In this work, we propose an end-to-end solution for temporal fact verification that considers the temporal information in claims to obtain relevant evidence sentences and harness the power of large language model for temporal reasoning. Recognizing that temporal facts often involve events, we model these events in the claim and evidence sentences. We curate two temporal fact datasets to learn time-sensitive representations that encapsulate not only the semantic relationships among the events, but also their chronological proximity. This allows us to retrieve the top-k relevant evidence sentences and provide the context for a large language model to perform temporal reasoning and outputs whether a claim is supported or refuted by the retrieved evidence sentences. Experiment results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly enhances the accuracy of temporal claim verification, thereby advancing current state-of-the-art in automated fact verification.</p></details> |  |

The resulting interactions are recorded at heterogeneous temporal resolutions across these domains. This multi-channel data can be combined and encoded to create a comprehensive representation of the customer's journey for accurate intent prediction. This demands sequential learning solutions. NMT transformers achieve state-of-the-art sequential representation learning by encoding context and decoding for the next best action to represent long-range dependencies. However, three major challenges exist while combining multi-domain sequences within an encode-decoder transformers architecture for intent prediction applications: a) aligning sequences with different sampling rates b) learning temporal dynamics across multi-variate, multi-domain sequences c) combining dynamic and static sequences. We propose an encoder-decoder transformer model to address these challenges for contextual and sequential intent prediction in financial servicing applications.

Recently, many novel models are proposed for ML on such graphs intensifying the need for robust evaluation and standardized benchmark datasets. However, the availability of such resources remains scarce and evaluation faces added complexity due to reproducibility issues in experimental protocols. To address these challenges, we introduce Temporal Graph Benchmark 2.0 (TGB 2.0), a novel benchmarking framework tailored for evaluating methods for predicting future links on Temporal Knowledge Graphs and Temporal Heterogeneous Graphs with a focus on large-scale datasets, extending the Temporal Graph Benchmark. TGB 2.0 facilitates comprehensive evaluations by presenting eight novel datasets spanning five domains with up to 53 million edges. TGB 2.0 datasets are significantly larger than existing datasets in terms of number of nodes, edges, or timestamps. In addition, TGB 2.0 provides a reproducible and realistic evaluation pipeline for multi-relational temporal graphs. Through extensive experimentation, we observe that 1) leveraging edge-type information is crucial to obtain high performance, 2) simple heuristic baselines are often competitive with more complex methods, 3) most methods fail to run on our largest datasets, highlighting the need for research on more scalable methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables, accepted at NeurIPS 2024 Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |

Previous work on online fair division has shown impossibility results in achieving approximate envy-freeness under these constraints. In contrast, we consider an informed setting where the algorithm has complete knowledge of future items, and aim to ensure that the cumulative allocation at each round satisfies approximate envy-freeness -- which we define as temporal envy-freeness up to one item (TEF1). We focus on settings where items can be exclusively goods or exclusively chores. For goods, while TEF1 allocations may not always exist, we identify several special cases where they do -- two agents, two item types, generalized binary valuations, unimodal preferences -- and provide polynomial-time algorithms for these cases. We also prove that determining the existence of a TEF1 allocation is NP-hard. For chores, we establish analogous results for the special cases, but present a slightly weaker intractability result. We also establish the incompatibility between TEF1 and Pareto-optimality, with the implication that it is intractable to find a TEF1 allocation that maximizes any $p$-mean welfare, even for two agents.</p></details> |  |

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained attention in recent years for their low energy consumption, but existing methods combining GCNs and SNNs fail to fully utilize the temporal characteristics of skeletal sequences, leading to increased storage and computational costs. To address this issue, we propose a Signal-SGN(Spiking Graph Convolutional Network), which leverages the temporal dimension of skeletal sequences as the spiking timestep and treats features as discrete stochastic signals. The core of the network consists of a 1D Spiking Graph Convolutional Network (1D-SGN) and a Frequency Spiking Convolutional Network (FSN). The SGN performs graph convolution on single frames and incorporates spiking network characteristics to capture inter-frame temporal relationships, while the FSN uses Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and complex convolution to extract temporal-frequency features. We also introduce a multi-scale wavelet transform feature fusion module(MWTF) to capture spectral features of temporal signals, enhancing the model's classification capability. We propose a pluggable temporal-frequency spatial semantic feature extraction module(TFSM) to enhance the model's ability to distinguish features without increasing inference-phase consumption. Our numerous experiments on the NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA datasets demonstrate that the proposed models not only surpass existing SNN-based methods in accuracy but also reduce computational and storage costs during training. Furthermore, they achieve competitive accuracy compared to corresponding GCN-based methods, which is quite remarkable.</p></details> |  |

These methods benefit from strong inductive biases but often at the expense of scalability and generalization. This paper proposes PredFormer, a pure transformer-based framework for spatiotemporal predictive learning. Motivated by the Vision Transformers (ViT) design, PredFormer leverages carefully designed Gated Transformer blocks, following a comprehensive analysis of 3D attention mechanisms, including full-, factorized-, and interleaved-spatial-temporal attention. With its recurrent-free, transformer-based design, PredFormer is both simple and efficient, significantly outperforming previous methods by large margins. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that PredFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance. On Moving MNIST, PredFormer achieves a 51.3% reduction in MSE relative to SimVP. For TaxiBJ, the model decreases MSE by 33.1% and boosts FPS from 533 to 2364. Additionally, on WeatherBench, it reduces MSE by 11.1% while enhancing FPS from 196 to 404. These performance gains in both accuracy and efficiency demonstrate PredFormer's potential for real-world applications.

In this work, we consider decision-making and probabilistic planning in stochastic systems modeled as Markov decision processes (MDPs), given a partially ordered preference over a set of temporally extended goals. Specifically, each temporally extended goal is expressed using a formula in Linear Temporal Logic on Finite Traces (LTL$_f$). To plan with the partially ordered preference, we introduce order theory to map a preference over temporal goals to a preference over policies for the MDP. Accordingly, a most preferred policy under a stochastic ordering induces a stochastic nondominated probability distribution over the finite paths in the MDP. To synthesize a most preferred policy, our technical approach includes two key steps. In the first step, we develop a procedure to transform a partially ordered preference over temporal goals into a computational model, called preference automaton, which is a semi-automaton with a partial order over acceptance conditions. In the second step, we prove that finding a most preferred policy is equivalent to computing a Pareto-optimal policy in a multi-objective MDP that is constructed from the original MDP, the preference automaton, and the chosen stochastic ordering relation. Throughout the paper, we employ running examples to illustrate the proposed preference specification and solution approaches. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm using these examples, providing detailed analysis, and then discuss several potential future directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2209.12267</p></details> |

To make the cooperation safe for the humans involved, the systems have to follow protocols with rigid real-time and real-space properties, but they also need to be capable of making competitive and collaborative decisions with varying rewards and penalties. Due to these tough requirements, the construction of system control software is often very difficult. This calls for applying a model-based engineering approach, which allows one to formally express the time and space properties and use them as guidance for the whole engineering process from requirement definition via system design to software development. Moreover, it is beneficial, if one can verify with acceptable effort, that the time and space requirements are preserved throughout the development steps. This paper focuses on modelling spatio-temporal properties and their model-checking and simulation using different analysis tools in combination with the methods and tool extensions proposed here. To this end, we provide an informal overview of CASTeL, our CASTeLogic. CASTeL is stochastic and includes real-time concurrency and real-space distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In this paper, we introduce TPP-LLM-Embedding, a unified model for efficiently embedding and retrieving event sequences based on natural language descriptions. Built on the TPP-LLM framework, which integrates large language models with temporal point processes, our model encodes both event types and times, generating a sequence-level representation through pooling. Textual descriptions are embedded using the same architecture, ensuring a shared embedding space for both sequences and descriptions. We optimize a contrastive loss based on similarity between these embeddings, bringing matching pairs closer and separating non-matching ones. TPP-LLM-Embedding enables efficient retrieval and demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models across diverse datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Deep Learning Method for Predicting Mergers and Acquisitions: Temporal Dynamic Industry Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07298v3)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Merger and Acquisition (M&A) activities play a vital role in market consolidation and restructuring. For acquiring companies, M&A serves as a key investment strategy, with one primary goal being to attain complementarities that enhance market power in competitive industries. In addition to intrinsic factors, a M&A behavior of a firm is influenced by the M&A activities of its peers, a phenomenon known as the "peer effect." However, existing research often fails to capture the rich interdependencies among M&A events within industry networks. An effective M&A predictive model should offer deal-level predictions without requiring ad-hoc feature engineering or data rebalancing. Such a model would predict the M&A behaviors of rival firms and provide specific recommendations for both bidder and target firms. However, most current models only predict one side of an M&A deal, lack firm-specific recommendations, and rely on arbitrary time intervals that impair predictive accuracy. Additionally, due to the sparsity of M&A events, existing models require data rebalancing, which introduces bias and limits their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, we propose a Temporal Dynamic Industry Network (TDIN) model, leveraging temporal point processes and deep learning to capture complex M&A interdependencies without ad-hoc data adjustments. The temporal point process framework inherently models event sparsity, eliminating the need for data rebalancing. Empirical evaluations on M&A data from January 1997 to December 2020 validate the effectiveness of our approach in predicting M&A events and offering actionable, deal-level recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data ...</summary><p>Data Processing Code: https://github.com/dayuyang1999/Merger_Acquisition_Data Modeling Code: https://github.com/dayuyang1999/Merger_Acquisition_Prediction</p></details> |

Recent studies in VTG employ cross-attention to correlate visual frames and text queries as individual token sequences. However, these approaches overlook a crucial aspect of the problem: a holistic understanding of the query sentence. A model may capture correlations between individual word tokens and arbitrary visual frames while possibly missing out on the global meaning. To address this, we introduce two primary contributions: (1) a visual frame-level gate mechanism that incorporates holistic textual information, (2) cross-modal alignment loss to learn the fine-grained correlation between query and relevant frames. As a result, we regularize the effect of individual word tokens and suppress irrelevant visual frames. We demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in VTG benchmarks, indicating that holistic text understanding guides the model to focus on the semantically important parts within the video.</p></details> | Accepted by ACMMM 24 |

To address this, we propose SynapticRAG, a novel approach integrating synaptic dynamics into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). SynapticRAG integrates temporal representations into memory vectors, mimicking biological synapses by differentiating events based on occurrence times and dynamically updating memory significance. This model employs temporal scoring for memory connections and a synaptic-inspired propagation control mechanism. Experiments across English, Japanese, and Chinese datasets demonstrate SynapticRAG's superiority over existing methods, including traditional RAG, with up to 14.66\% improvement in memory retrieval accuracy. Our approach advances context-aware dialogue AI systems by enhancing long-term context maintenance and specific information extraction from conversations.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating the behaviour of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) in both safety-critical and regular scenarios is essential for assessing their robustness before real-world deployment. By integrating scenarios derived from real-world datasets into the simulation, we enhance the plausibility and validity of testing sets. This work introduces a novel approach that employs temporal scene graphs to capture evolving spatiotemporal relationships among scene entities from a real-world dataset, enabling the generation of dynamic scenarios in simulation through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). User-defined action and criticality conditioning are used to ensure flexible, tailored scenario creation. Our model significantly outperforms the benchmarks in accurately predicting links corresponding to the requested scenarios. We further evaluate the validity and compatibility of our generated scenarios in an off-the-shelf simulator.</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |

However, understanding the dynamics learned by these models and explaining their behaviour is significantly more complex than for models dealing with static data. Inspired by Koopman theory, which allows a simpler description of intricate, nonlinear dynamical systems, we introduce an explainability approach for temporal graphs. We present two methods to interpret the STGNN's decision process and identify the most relevant spatial and temporal patterns in the input for the task at hand. The first relies on dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), a Koopman-inspired dimensionality reduction method. The second relies on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy), a popular method for discovering governing equations, which we use for the first time as a general tool for explainability. We show how our methods can correctly identify interpretable features such as infection times and infected nodes in the context of dissemination processes.</p></details> |  |

This intricate task involves the reasoning of linguistic and visual modalities, along with the temporal association of target objects. However, the seminal work employs only loose feature fusion and overlooks the utilization of long-term information on tracked objects. In this study, we introduce a compact Transformer-based method, termed TenRMOT. We conduct feature fusion at both encoding and decoding stages to fully exploit the advantages of Transformer architecture. Specifically, we incrementally perform cross-modal fusion layer-by-layer during the encoding phase. In the decoding phase, we utilize language-guided queries to probe memory features for accurate prediction of the desired objects. Moreover, we introduce a query update module that explicitly leverages temporal prior information of the tracked objects to enhance the consistency of their trajectories. In addition, we introduce a novel task called Referring Multi-Object Tracking and Segmentation (RMOTS) and construct a new dataset named Ref-KITTI Segmentation. Our dataset consists of 18 videos with 818 expressions, and each expression averages 10.7 masks, which poses a greater challenge compared to the typical single mask in most existing referring video segmentation datasets. TenRMOT demonstrates superior performance on both the referring multi-object tracking and the segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Current methods focused on modeling one-dimensional temporal information but overlooked the latent periodic information within time series. Moreover, most studies developed algorithms for ATP based on a single or a few routes of public transport, which reduces the transferability of the prediction models and their applicability in public transport management systems. To this end, this paper proposes \textit{ArrivalNet}, a two-dimensional temporal variation-based multi-step ATP for buses and trams. It decomposes the one-dimensional temporal sequence into intra-periodic and inter-periodic variations, which can be recast into two-dimensional tensors (2D blocks). Each row of a tensor contains the time points within a period, and each column involves the time points at the same intra-periodic index across various periods. The transformed 2D blocks in different frequencies have an image-like feature representation that enables effective learning with computer vision backbones (e.g., convolutional neural network). Drawing on the concept of residual neural network, the 2D block module is designed as a basic module for flexible aggregation. Meanwhile, contextual factors like workdays, peak hours, and intersections, are also utilized in the augmented feature representation to improve the performance of prediction. 125 days of public transport data from Dresden were collected for model training and validation. Experimental results show that the root mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of the proposed predictor decrease by at least 6.1\%, 14.7\%, and 34.2\% compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at IEEE T-ITS</p></details> |

Recently, significant attempts have been made to benchmark datasets and metrics to evaluate LLMs for these traits. However, structural simplicity (subject-relation-object) and contemporary association in their query formulation limit the broader definition of factuality and consistency. In this study, we introduce TeCFaP, a novel Temporally Consistent Factuality Probe task to expand the consistent factuality probe in the temporal dimension. To this end, we propose TEMP-COFAC, a high-quality dataset of prefix-style English query paraphrases. Subsequently, we extend the definitions of existing metrics to represent consistent factuality across temporal dimension. We experiment with a diverse set of LLMs and find most of them performing poorly on TeCFaP. Next, we propose a novel solution CoTSeLF (Consistent-Time-Sensitive Learning Framework) combining multi-task instruction tuning (MT-IT) with consistent-time-sensitive reinforcement learning (CTSRL) to improve temporally consistent factuality in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CoTSeLF over several baselines.</p></details> |  |

We present a comprehensive investigation of Graph U-Nets, originally developed for classification tasks, now tailored for mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal forecasting of fluid dynamics. Our focus is on enhancing their performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and architectural modifications. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements in both transductive and inductive learning settings, showcasing the adaptability of Graph U-Nets to various flow conditions and mesh structures. This work contributes to the field of reduced-order modeling for computational fluid dynamics by establishing Graph U-Nets as a viable and flexible alternative to convolutional neural networks, capable of accurately and efficiently predicting complex fluid flow phenomena across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the occupancy rate from large-scale datasets to identify gaps between supply and demand in public transportation. Leveraging the spatio-temporal granularity of data from Automatic People Counting (APC) and relying on the Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model and the Generalized Mixed-Effect Random Forest, in this study we propose a methodology for analyzing factors determining undercrowding. The results of the model are examined at both the segment and ride levels. Initially, the analysis focuses on identifying segments more likely associated with undercrowding, understanding factors influencing the probability of undercrowding, and exploring their relationships. Subsequently, the analysis extends to the temporal distribution of undercrowding, encompassing its impact on the entire journey. The proposed methodology is applied to analyze APC data, provided by the company responsible for public transport management in Milan, on a radial route of the surface transportation network.</p></details> | Pre-print version |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Communication Consistent Approach to Signal Temporal Logic Task Decomposition in Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12563v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of decomposing a global task assigned to a multi-agent system, expressed as a formula within a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL), under range-limited communication. Given a global task expressed as a conjunction of local tasks defined over the individual and relative states of agents in the system, we propose representing task dependencies among agents as edges of a suitably defined task graph. At the same time, range-limited communication naturally induces the definition of a communication graph that defines which agents have access to each other's states. Within these settings, inconsistencies arise when a task dependency between a pair of agents is not supported by a corresponding communication link due to the limited communication range. As a result, state feedback control laws previously derived to achieve the tasks' satisfaction can not be leveraged. We propose a task decomposition mechanism to distribute tasks assigned to pairs of non-communicating agents in the system as conjunctions of tasks defined over the relative states of communicating agents, thus enforcing consistency between task and communication graphs. Assuming the super-level sets of the predicate functions composing the STL tasks are bounded polytopes, our task decomposition mechanism can be cast as a parameter optimization problem and solved via state-of-the-art decentralized convex optimization algorithms. To guarantee the soundness of our approach, we present various conditions under which the tasks defined in the applied STL fragment are unsatisfiable, and we show sufficient conditions such that our decomposition approach yields satisfiable global tasks after decomposition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resolving Sets in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13183v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A resolving set $R$ in a graph $G$ is a set of vertices such that every vertex of $G$ is uniquely identified by its distances to the vertices of $R$. Introduced in the 1970s, this concept has been since then extensively studied from both combinatorial and algorithmic points of view. We propose a generalization of the concept of resolving sets to temporal graphs,i.e., graphs with edge sets that change over discrete time-steps. In this setting, the temporal distance from $u$ to $v$ is the earliest possible time-step at which a journey with strictly increasing time-steps on edges leaving $u$ reaches $v$, i.e., the first time-step at which $v$ could receive a message broadcast from $u$. A temporal resolving set of a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is a subset $R$ of its vertices such that every vertex of $\mathcal{G}$ is uniquely identified by its temporal distances from vertices of $R$. We study the problem of finding a minimum-size temporal resolving set, and show that it is NP-complete even on very restricted graph classes and with strong constraints on the time-steps: temporal complete graphs where every edge appears in either time-step~1 or~2, temporal trees where every edge appears in at most two consecutive time-steps, and even temporal subdivided stars where every edge appears in at most two (not necessarily consecutive) time-steps. On the other hand, we give polynomial-time algorithms for temporal paths and temporal stars where every edge appears in exactly one time-step, and give a combinatorial analysis and algorithms for several temporal graph classes where the edges appear in periodic time-steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>vario...</summary><p>various improvements, right affiliations</p></details> |

For concurrent programs, Higher Dimensional Automata (HDA) are a very expressive model of non-interleaving concurrency. HDA recognize languages of partially ordered multisets, or pomsets. Recent work has shown that Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic is as expressive as HDA for pomset languages. In this paper, we investigate the class of pomset languages that are definable in First Order (FO) logic. As expected, this is a strict subclass of MSO-definable languages. In the case of words, Kamp's theorem states that FO is as expressive as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our aim is to prove a variant of Kamp's theorem for pomset languages. Thus, we define a temporal logic called Sparse Pomset Temporal Logic (SPTL), and show that it is equivalent to FO, when there is no autoconcurrency.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages + references + 2 pages appendix, submitted to FoSSaCS 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods typically require centralized data collection, which poses significant privacy and communication challenges. In this work, we introduce a novel Federated Temporal Graph Clustering (FTGC) framework that enables decentralized training of graph neural networks (GNNs) across multiple clients, ensuring data privacy throughout the process. Our approach incorporates a temporal aggregation mechanism to effectively capture the evolution of graph structures over time and a federated optimization strategy to collaboratively learn high-quality clustering representations. By preserving data privacy and reducing communication overhead, our framework achieves competitive performance on temporal graph datasets, making it a promising solution for privacy-sensitive, real-world applications involving dynamic data.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

Traditional time series approaches for prediction often focus on either autoregressive modeling, which relies solely on past observations of the target ``endogenous variables'', or forward modeling, which considers only current covariate drivers ``exogenous variables''. However, effectively integrating past endogenous and past exogenous with current exogenous variables remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose ExoTST, a novel transformer-based framework that effectively incorporates current exogenous variables alongside past context for improved time series prediction. To integrate exogenous information efficiently, ExoTST leverages the strengths of attention mechanisms and introduces a novel cross-temporal modality fusion module. This module enables the model to jointly learn from both past and current exogenous series, treating them as distinct modalities. By considering these series separately, ExoTST provides robustness and flexibility in handling data uncertainties that arise from the inherent distribution shift between historical and current exogenous variables. Extensive experiments on real-world carbon flux datasets and time series benchmarks demonstrate ExoTST's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines, with improvements of up to 10\% in prediction accuracy. Moreover, ExoTST exhibits strong robustness against missing values and noise in exogenous drivers, maintaining consistent performance in real-world situations where these imperfections are common.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICDM 2024</p></details> |

Uncertainty is considered in the workspace structure and the outcomes of control decisions giving rise to an unknown Markov Decision Process (MDP). Existing reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms for LTL tasks typically rely on exploring a product MDP state-space uniformly (using e.g., an $\epsilon$-greedy policy) compromising sample-efficiency. This issue becomes more pronounced as the rewards get sparser and the MDP size or the task complexity increase. In this paper, we propose an accelerated RL algorithm that can learn control policies significantly faster than competitive approaches. Its sample-efficiency relies on a novel task-driven exploration strategy that biases exploration towards directions that may contribute to task satisfaction. We provide theoretical analysis and extensive comparative experiments demonstrating the sample-efficiency of the proposed method. The benefit of our method becomes more evident as the task complexity or the MDP size increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2205.04424</p></details> |

While it is well understood that linear TD converges almost surely to a unique point, this convergence traditionally requires the assumption that the features used by the approximator are linearly independent. However, this linear independence assumption does not hold in many practical scenarios. This work is the first to establish the almost sure convergence of linear TD without requiring linearly independent features. In fact, we do not make any assumptions on the features. We prove that the approximated value function converges to a unique point and the weight iterates converge to a set. We also establish a notion of local stability of the weight iterates. Importantly, we do not need to introduce any other additional assumptions and do not need to make any modification to the linear TD algorithm. Key to our analysis is a novel characterization of bounded invariant sets of the mean ODE of linear TD.</p></details> | 30 pages, 0 figures |

Due to the lack of fine-grained temporal annotations, existing video benchmarks mostly resemble static image benchmarks and are incompetent at evaluating models for temporal understanding. In this paper, we introduce TemporalBench, a new benchmark dedicated to evaluating fine-grained temporal understanding in videos. TemporalBench consists of ~10K video question-answer pairs, derived from ~2K high-quality human annotations detailing the temporal dynamics in video clips. As a result, our benchmark provides a unique testbed for evaluating various temporal understanding and reasoning abilities such as action frequency, motion magnitude, event order, etc. Moreover, it enables evaluations on various tasks like both video question answering and captioning, both short and long video understanding, as well as different models such as multimodal video embedding models and text generation models. Results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o achieve only 38.5% question answering accuracy on TemporalBench, demonstrating a significant gap (~30%) between humans and AI in temporal understanding. Furthermore, we notice a critical pitfall for multi-choice QA where LLMs can detect the subtle changes in negative captions and find a centralized description as a cue for its prediction, where we propose Multiple Binary Accuracy (MBA) to correct such bias. We hope that TemporalBench can foster research on improving models' temporal reasoning capabilities. Both dataset and evaluation code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://temporalbench.github.io/</p></details> |

They were introduced in 2010 and have been much studied since, in particular via an extension of the temporal logic LTL called HyperLTL. Most verification efforts for HyperLTL are restricted to finite-state systems, usually defined as Kripke structures. In this paper we study hyperproperties for an important class of infinite-state systems. We consider population protocols, a popular distributed computing model in which arbitrarily many identical finite-state agents interact in pairs. Population protocols are a good candidate for studying hyperproperties because the main decidable verification problem, well-specification, is a hyperproperty. We first show that even for simple (monadic) formulas, HyperLTL verification for population protocols is undecidable. We then turn our attention to immediate observation population protocols, a simpler and well-studied subclass of population protocols. We show that verification of monadic HyperLTL formulas without the next operator is decidable in 2-EXPSPACE, but that all extensions make the problem undecidable.</p></details> | 42 pages, 5 figures |

Accurate forecasting of nuclear radiation levels is crucial for informed decision-making by both individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, an innovative framework tailored for national-wide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against seven baselines. This research not only enhances the accuracy and reliability in nuclear radiation forecasting but also contributes to advancing emergency response strategies and monitoring systems, thereby safeguarding environmental and public health.</p></details> |  |

This approach captures both spatial and temporal dependencies within sensor data, improving the accuracy of bearing fault detection under various conditions. Methodology: The proposed method converts time series sensor data into graph representations. GAT captures spatial relationships between components, while LSTM models temporal patterns. The model is validated using the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) Bearing Dataset, which includes data under different horsepower levels and both normal and faulty conditions. Its performance is compared with methods such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Local Outlier Factor (LOF), Isolation Forest (IForest) and GNN-based method for bearing fault detection (GNNBFD). Findings: The model achieved outstanding results, with precision, recall, and F1-scores reaching 100\% across various testing conditions. It not only identifies faults accurately but also generalizes effectively across different operational scenarios, outperforming traditional methods. Originality: This research presents a unique combination of GAT and LSTM for fault detection, overcoming the limitations of traditional time series methods by capturing complex spatial-temporal dependencies. Its superior performance demonstrates significant potential for predictive maintenance in industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

The multiplication of variables and constraints is commonly done during grounding and the solver is completely ignorant about the temporal relationship among the different instances. On the other hand, a key factor in the performance of today's ASP solvers is conflict-driven constraint learning. Our question is now whether a constraint learned for particular time steps can be generalized and reused at other time stamps, and ultimately whether this enhances the overall solver performance on temporal problems. Knowing full well the domain of time, we study conditions under which learned dynamic constraints can be generalized. We propose a simple translation of the original logic program such that, for the translated programs, the learned constraints can be generalized to other time points. Additionally, we identify a property of temporal problems that allows us to generalize all learned constraints to all time steps. It turns out that this property is satisfied by many planning problems. Finally, we empirically evaluate the impact of adding the generalized constraints to an ASP solver.

However, the restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to the low resolution of ODVs. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods are proposed to enhance the resolution of videos, but ODV projection distortions in the application are not well addressed directly applying such methods. To achieve better super-resolution reconstruction quality, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatio-temporal distortion modulation module is introduced to improve spatial ODV projection distortions and exploit the temporal correlation according to intra and inter alignments. Next, we design a multi-frame reconstruction and fusion mechanism to refine the consistency of reconstructed ODV frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive maps in the loss function to concentrate on important viewpoint regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In addition, we collect a new ODV-SR dataset with various scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STDAN achieves superior super-resolution performance on ODVs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[TADA: Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation for Time Series Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15174v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization aim to train models to effectively perform on samples that are unseen and outside of the distribution. Adversarial data augmentation (ADA) is a widely used technique in domain generalization. It enhances the model robustness by including synthetic samples designed to simulate potential unseen scenarios into the training datasets, which is then used to train the model. However, in time series data, traditional ADA approaches often fail to address distribution shifts related to temporal characteristics. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Adversarial Data Augmentation (TADA) for time series data, which incorporate time warping into ADA. Although time warping is inherently non-differentiable, ADA relies on generating samples through backpropagation. We resolve this issue by leveraging the duality between phase shifts in the frequency domain and time shifts in the time domain, thereby making the process differentiable. Our evaluations across various time series datasets demonstrate that TADA outperforms existing methods for domain generalization. In addition, using distribution visualization, we confirmed that the distribution shifts induced by TADA are clearly different from those induced by ADA, and together, they effectively simulate real-world distribution shifts.</p></details> |  |

However, most Video-LLMs treat videos as a sequential set of individual frames, which results in insufficient temporal-spatial interaction that hinders fine-grained comprehension and difficulty in processing longer videos due to limited visual token capacity. To address these challenges, we propose VidCompress, a novel Video-LLM featuring memory-enhanced temporal compression. VidCompress employs a dual-compressor approach: a memory-enhanced compressor captures both short-term and long-term temporal relationships in videos and compresses the visual tokens using a multiscale transformer with a memory-cache mechanism, while a text-perceived compressor generates condensed visual tokens by utilizing Q-Former and integrating temporal contexts into query embeddings with cross attention. Experiments on several VideoQA datasets and comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate that VidCompress efficiently models complex temporal-spatial relations and significantly outperforms existing Video-LLMs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Siamese Based Trackers with Light or No Training through Multiple Templates and Temporal Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13812v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High computational power and significant time are usually needed to train a deep learning based tracker on large datasets. Depending on many factors, training might not always be an option. In this paper, we propose a framework with two ideas on Siamese-based trackers. (i) Extending number of templates in a way that removes the need to retrain the network and (ii) a lightweight temporal network with a novel architecture focusing on both local and global information that can be used independently from trackers. Most Siamese-based trackers only rely on the first frame as the ground truth for objects and struggle when the target's appearance changes significantly in subsequent frames in presence of similar distractors. Some trackers use multiple templates which mostly rely on constant thresholds to update, or they replace those templates that have low similarity scores only with more similar ones. Unlike previous works, we use adaptive thresholds that update the bag with similar templates as well as those templates which are slightly diverse. Adaptive thresholds also cause an overall improvement over constant ones. In addition, mixing feature maps obtained by each template in the last stage of networks removes the need to retrain trackers. Our proposed lightweight temporal network, CombiNet, learns the path history of different objects using only object coordinates and predicts target's potential location in the next frame. It is tracker independent and applying it on new trackers does not need further training. By implementing these ideas, trackers' performance improved on all datasets tested on, including LaSOT, LaSOT extension, TrackingNet, OTB100, OTB50, UAV123 and UAV20L. Experiments indicate the proposed framework works well with both convolutional and transformer-based trackers. The official python code for this paper will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[TEOcc: Radar-camera Multi-modal Occupancy Prediction via Temporal Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11228v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a novel 3D scene representation, semantic occupancy has gained much attention in autonomous driving. However, existing occupancy prediction methods mainly focus on designing better occupancy representations, such as tri-perspective view or neural radiance fields, while ignoring the advantages of using long-temporal information. In this paper, we propose a radar-camera multi-modal temporal enhanced occupancy prediction network, dubbed TEOcc. Our method is inspired by the success of utilizing temporal information in 3D object detection. Specifically, we introduce a temporal enhancement branch to learn temporal occupancy prediction. In this branch, we randomly discard the t-k input frame of the multi-view camera and predict its 3D occupancy by long-term and short-term temporal decoders separately with the information from other adjacent frames and multi-modal inputs. Besides, to reduce computational costs and incorporate multi-modal inputs, we specially designed 3D convolutional layers for long-term and short-term temporal decoders. Furthermore, since the lightweight occupancy prediction head is a dense classification head, we propose to use a shared occupancy prediction head for the temporal enhancement and main branches. It is worth noting that the temporal enhancement branch is only performed during training and is discarded during inference. Experiment results demonstrate that TEOcc achieves state-of-the-art occupancy prediction on nuScenes benchmarks. In addition, the proposed temporal enhancement branch is a plug-and-play module that can be easily integrated into existing occupancy prediction methods to improve the performance of occupancy prediction. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/VDIGPKU/TEOcc.</p></details> | Accepted by ECAI2024 |
| **[LVD-2M: A Long-take Video Dataset with Temporally Dense Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10816v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficacy of video generation models heavily depends on the quality of their training datasets. Most previous video generation models are trained on short video clips, while recently there has been increasing interest in training long video generation models directly on longer videos. However, the lack of such high-quality long videos impedes the advancement of long video generation. To promote research in long video generation, we desire a new dataset with four key features essential for training long video generation models: (1) long videos covering at least 10 seconds, (2) long-take videos without cuts, (3) large motion and diverse contents, and (4) temporally dense captions. To achieve this, we introduce a new pipeline for selecting high-quality long-take videos and generating temporally dense captions. Specifically, we define a set of metrics to quantitatively assess video quality including scene cuts, dynamic degrees, and semantic-level quality, enabling us to filter high-quality long-take videos from a large amount of source videos. Subsequently, we develop a hierarchical video captioning pipeline to annotate long videos with temporally-dense captions. With this pipeline, we curate the first long-take video dataset, LVD-2M, comprising 2 million long-take videos, each covering more than 10 seconds and annotated with temporally dense captions. We further validate the effectiveness of LVD-2M by fine-tuning video generation models to generate long videos with dynamic motions. We believe our work will significantly contribute to future research in long video generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Dataset and Benchmark Track.

The Linear Inverse Model (LIM) is a class of data-driven methods that extract dynamic and stochastic information from finite time-series data of complex systems. In this study, we introduce a new variant of LIM, called Colored-LIM, which models stochasticity using Ornstein-Uhlenbeck colored noise. Despite the non-trivial correlation between observable and colored noise, we show that Colored-LIM unveils the desired information merely from the correlation function of the observable. Therefore, this approach not only accounts for the memory effects of environmental noise, traditionally represented by time-uncorrelated white noise in the Classical LIM framework, but does so using the same observation dataset without requiring additional data. Furthermore, we show that Colored-LIM does not reduce to Classical LIM in the white noise limit, underscoring the importance of temporal dependencies in stochastic systems. In this paper, we rigorously develop the Colored-LIM, explore its connections with the Classical LIM and Dynamic Mode Decomposition, and validate its effectiveness on both ideal linear and nonlinear systems. In addition, we illustrate the potential applications and implications of Colored-LIM for real-world problems, including the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation and the electricity network of Tohoku University.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |

Equivariant contrastive learning, on the other hand, provides representations sensitive to specific image transformations while remaining invariant to others. By introducing equivariance to time-induced transformations, such as disease-related anatomical changes in longitudinal imaging, the model can effectively capture such changes in the representation space. In this work, we propose a Time-equivariant Contrastive Learning (TC) method. First, an encoder embeds two unlabeled scans from different time points of the same patient into the representation space. Next, a temporal equivariance module is trained to predict the representation of a later visit based on the representation from one of the previous visits and the corresponding time interval with a novel regularization loss term while preserving the invariance property to irrelevant image transformations. On a large longitudinal dataset, our model clearly outperforms existing equivariant contrastive methods in predicting progression from intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to advanced wet-AMD within a specified time-window.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2024 (early accept, top 11%)</p></details> |
| **[Get Rid of Task Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Will LLMs Replace the Encoder-Only Models in Temporal Relation Classification?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10476v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic detection of temporal relations among events has been mainly investigated with encoder-only models such as RoBERTa. Large Language Models (LLM) have recently shown promising performance in temporal reasoning tasks such as temporal question answering. Nevertheless, recent studies have tested the LLMs' performance in detecting temporal relations of closed-source models only, limiting the interpretability of those results. In this work, we investigate LLMs' performance and decision process in the Temporal Relation Classification task. First, we assess the performance of seven open and closed-sourced LLMs experimenting with in-context learning and lightweight fine-tuning approaches. Results show that LLMs with in-context learning significantly underperform smaller encoder-only models based on RoBERTa. Then, we delve into the possible reasons for this gap by applying explainable methods. The outcome suggests a limitation of LLMs in this task due to their autoregressive nature, which causes them to focus only on the last part of the sequence. Additionally, we evaluate the word embeddings of these two models to better understand their pre-training differences. The code and the fine-tuned models can be found respectively on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Action Localization for Inertial-based Human Activity Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15831v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As of today, state-of-the-art activity recognition from wearable sensors relies on algorithms being trained to classify fixed windows of data. In contrast, video-based Human Activity Recognition, known as Temporal Action Localization (TAL), has followed a segment-based prediction approach, localizing activity segments in a timeline of arbitrary length. This paper is the first to systematically demonstrate the applicability of state-of-the-art TAL models for both offline and near-online Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using raw inertial data as well as pre-extracted latent features as input. Offline prediction results show that TAL models are able to outperform popular inertial models on a multitude of HAR benchmark datasets, with improvements reaching as much as 26% in F1-score. We show that by analyzing timelines as a whole, TAL models can produce more coherent segments and achieve higher NULL-class accuracy across all datasets. We demonstrate that TAL is less suited for the immediate classification of small-sized windows of data, yet offers an interesting perspective on inertial-based HAR -- alleviating the need for fixed-size windows and enabling algorithms to recognize activities of arbitrary length. With design choices and training concepts yet to be explored, we argue that TAL architectures could be of significant value to the inertial-based HAR community.

However, the presence of data noise and label sparsity in spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges for existing neural network models in learning effective and robust region representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph masked autoencoder paradigm that explores generative self-supervised learning for effective spatio-temporal data augmentation. Our proposed framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph neural encoder that captures region-wise dependencies from heterogeneous data sources, enabling the modeling of diverse spatial dependencies. In our spatio-temporal self-supervised learning paradigm, we incorporate a masked autoencoding mechanism on node representations and structures. This mechanism automatically distills heterogeneous spatio-temporal dependencies across regions over time, enhancing the learning process of dynamic region-wise spatial correlations. To validate the effectiveness of our STGMAE framework, we conduct extensive experiments on various spatio-temporal mining tasks. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art baselines. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework in terms of performance and its ability to address the challenges of spatial and temporal data noise and sparsity in practical urban sensing scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages |

In practical environments with noise-corrupted audio, the role of video information becomes crucial. However, prior works have primarily focused on enhancing audio features in AVSR, overlooking the importance of video features. In this study, we strengthen the video features by learning three temporal dynamics in video data: context order, playback direction, and the speed of video frames. Cross-modal attention modules are introduced to enrich video features with audio information so that speech variability can be taken into account when training on the video temporal dynamics. Based on our approach, we achieve the state-of-the-art performance on the LRS2 and LRS3 AVSR benchmarks for the noise-dominant settings. Our approach excels in scenarios especially for babble and speech noise, indicating the ability to distinguish the speech signal that should be recognized from lip movements in the video modality. We support the validity of our methodology by offering the ablation experiments for the temporal dynamics losses and the cross-modal attention architecture design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SLT 2024 Main Conference; Code is available at https://github.com/sungnyun/avsr-temporal-dynamics</p></details> |

In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation. Experimental results show that proposed method outperforms latest generative models and the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on both talking-face videos and moving-body videos in terms of both objective and subjective quality.

| **[StatioCL: Contrastive Learning for Time Series via Non-Stationary and Temporal Contrast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10048v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning (CL) has emerged as a promising approach for representation learning in time series data by embedding similar pairs closely while distancing dissimilar ones. However, existing CL methods often introduce false negative pairs (FNPs) by neglecting inherent characteristics and then randomly selecting distinct segments as dissimilar pairs, leading to erroneous representation learning, reduced model performance, and overall inefficiency. To address these issues, we systematically define and categorize FNPs in time series into semantic false negative pairs and temporal false negative pairs for the first time: the former arising from overlooking similarities in label categories, which correlates with similarities in non-stationarity and the latter from neglecting temporal proximity. Moreover, we introduce StatioCL, a novel CL framework that captures non-stationarity and temporal dependency to mitigate both FNPs and rectify the inaccuracies in learned representations. By interpreting and differentiating non-stationary states, which reflect the correlation between trends or temporal dynamics with underlying data patterns, StatioCL effectively captures the semantic characteristics and eliminates semantic FNPs. Simultaneously, StatioCL establishes fine-grained similarity levels based on temporal dependencies to capture varying temporal proximity between segments and to mitigate temporal FNPs. Evaluated on real-world benchmark time series classification datasets, StatioCL demonstrates a substantial improvement over state-of-the-art CL methods, achieving a 2.9% increase in Recall and a 19.2% reduction in FNPs. Most importantly, StatioCL also shows enhanced data efficiency and robustness against label scarcity.</p></details> | Accepted in CIKM24 |

Existing works have considered the problem where either all agents are controllable, the agent models are deterministic and known, or no safety guarantees are provided. We propose a predictive control synthesis framework that guarantees, with high probability, the satisfaction of signal temporal logic (STL) tasks that are defined over a controllable system in the presence of uncontrollable stochastic agents. We use trajectory predictors and conformal prediction to construct probabilistic prediction regions for each uncontrollable agent that are valid over multiple future time steps. Specifically, we construct a normalized prediction region over all agents and time steps to reduce conservatism and increase data efficiency. We then formulate a worst-case bilevel mixed integer program (MIP) that accounts for all agent realizations within the prediction region to obtain an open-loop controller that provably guarantee task satisfaction with high probability. To efficiently solve this bilevel MIP, we propose an equivalent MIP program based on KKT conditions of the original bilevel formulation. Building upon this, we design a closed-loop controller, where both recursive feasibility and task satisfaction can be guaranteed with high probability. We illustrate our control synthesis framework on two case studies.</p></details> |  |

However, existing CD methods still struggle to address pseudo changes resulting from domain information differences in multi-temporal images and instances of detail errors caused by the loss and contamination of detail features during the upsampling process in the network. To address this, we propose a bi-temporal Gaussian distribution feature-dependent network (BGFD). Specifically, we first introduce the Gaussian noise domain disturbance (GNDD) module, which approximates distribution using image statistical features to characterize domain information, samples noise to perturb the network for learning redundant domain information, addressing domain information differences from a more fundamental perspective. Additionally, within the feature dependency facilitation (FDF) module, we integrate a novel mutual information difference loss ($L_{MI}$) and more sophisticated attention mechanisms to enhance the capabilities of the network, ensuring the acquisition of essential domain information. Subsequently, we have designed a novel detail feature compensation (DFC) module, which compensates for detail feature loss and contamination introduced during the upsampling process from the perspectives of enhancing local features and refining global features. The BGFD has effectively reduced pseudo changes and enhanced the detection capability of detail information. It has also achieved state-of-the-art performance on four publicly available datasets - DSIFN-CD, SYSU-CD, LEVIR-CD, and S2Looking, surpassing baseline models by +8.58%, +1.28%, +0.31%, and +3.76% respectively, in terms of the F1-Score metric.</p></details> |  |

Using Scito2M, we conduct a temporal study spanning over 30 years to explore key questions in scientometrics: the evolution of academic terminology, citation patterns, and interdisciplinary knowledge exchange. Our findings reveal critical insights, such as disparities in epistemic cultures, knowledge production modes, and citation practices.

However, existing traffic forecasting models still face the following limitations. On one hand, most previous studies either focus too much on real-world geographic information, neglecting the potential traffic correlation between different regions, or overlook geographical position and only model the traffic flow relationship. On the other hand, the importance of different time slices is ignored in time modeling. Therefore, we propose a Fusion Matrix Prompt Enhanced Self-Attention Spatial-Temporal Interactive Traffic Forecasting Framework (FMPESTF), which is composed of spatial and temporal modules for down-sampling traffic data. The network is designed to establish a traffic fusion matrix considering spatial-temporal heterogeneity as a query to reconstruct a data-driven dynamic traffic data structure, which accurately reveal the flow relationship of nodes in the traffic network. In addition, we introduce attention mechanism in time modeling, and design hierarchical spatial-temporal interactive learning to help the model adapt to various traffic scenarios. Through extensive experimental on six real-world traffic datasets, our method is significantly superior to other baseline models, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy in dealing with traffic forecasting problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>THE W...</summary><p>THE WEB CONFERENCE 2025</p></details> |

We introduce ReasonPlanner, a novel generalist agent designed for reflective thinking, planning, and interactive reasoning. This agent leverages LLMs to plan hypothetical trajectories by building a World Model based on a Temporal Knowledge Graph. The agent interacts with the environment using a natural language actor-critic module, where the actor translates the imagined trajectory into a sequence of actionable steps, and the critic determines if replanning is necessary. ReasonPlanner significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art prompting-based methods on the ScienceWorld benchmark by more than 1.8 times, while being more sample-efficient and interpretable. It relies solely on frozen weights thus requiring no gradient updates. ReasonPlanner can be deployed and utilized without specialized knowledge of Machine Learning, making it accessible to a wide range of users.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep learning has shown great promise for real estate appraisal by harnessing substantial online transaction data from web platforms. Nonetheless, deep learning is data-hungry, and thus it may not be trivially applicable to enormous small cities with limited data. To this end, we propose Meta-Transfer Learning Empowered Temporal Graph Networks (MetaTransfer) to transfer valuable knowledge from multiple data-rich metropolises to the data-scarce city to improve valuation performance. Specifically, by modeling the ever-growing real estate transactions with associated residential communities as a temporal event heterogeneous graph, we first design an Event-Triggered Temporal Graph Network to model the irregular spatiotemporal correlations between evolving real estate transactions. Besides, we formulate the city-wide real estate appraisal as a multi-task dynamic graph link label prediction problem, where the valuation of each community in a city is regarded as an individual task. A Hypernetwork-Based Multi-Task Learning module is proposed to simultaneously facilitate intra-city knowledge sharing between multiple communities and task-specific parameters generation to accommodate the community-wise real estate price distribution. Furthermore, we propose a Tri-Level Optimization Based Meta- Learning framework to adaptively re-weight training transaction instances from multiple source cities to mitigate negative transfer, and thus improve the cross-city knowledge transfer effectiveness. Finally, extensive experiments based on five real-world datasets demonstrate the significant superiority of MetaTransfer compared with eleven baseline algorithms.</p></details> | 12 pages |

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v5)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods. Therefore, it is shown that LeTO provides a practical example of how to achieve the integration of neural networks with trajectory optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> |  |

Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories.

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ackno...</summary><p>acknowledgement added</p></details> |

For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6(+1)...</summary><p>6(+1) pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cooperative Trajectory Planning: Principles for Human-Machine System Design on Trajectory Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16938v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores cooperative trajectory planning approaches within the context of human-machine shared control. In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

| **[Influential Language Data Selection via Gradient Trajectory Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16710v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Time Warping-based imputation of long gaps in human mobility trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16096v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual mobility trajectories are difficult to measure and often incur long periods of missingness. Aggregation of this mobility data without accounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating travel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple Imputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility trajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This method reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel behavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the dynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series preceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes values multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal parameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods are applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with simulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling missingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when gaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps become longer and when more data are available.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

In practice, different driving scenarios present varying levels of difficulty for trajectory prediction models. However, most existing research focuses on the average precision of prediction results, while ignoring the underlying distribution of the input scenarios. This paper proposes a critical example mining method that utilizes a data-driven approach to estimate the rareness of the trajectories. By combining the rareness estimation of observations with whole trajectories, the proposed method effectively identifies a subset of data that is relatively hard to predict BEFORE feeding them to a specific prediction model. The experimental results show that the mined subset has higher prediction error when applied to different downstream prediction models, which reaches +108.1% error (greater than two times compared to the average on dataset) when mining 5% samples. Further analysis indicates that the mined critical examples include uncommon cases such as sudden brake and cancelled lane-change, which helps to better understand and improve the performance of prediction models.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. Our results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. For standardized evaluation, we introduce MPEv2, an enhanced version of Multi Particle Environments (MPE), consisting of 12 benchmarks. Benchmarks, implementations, and trained models are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. The results demonstrated the significant superiority of the proposed methods over the baselines in terms of the closed-loop metrics.

The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The trajectory planning for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is formulated as a game with coupled safety constraints. We then define interaction-fair trajectories and prove that they correspond to the variational equilibrium (VE) of this game. We propose a semi-decentralized planner for the vehicles to seek VE-based fair trajectories, which can significantly improve computational efficiency through parallel computing among CAVs and enhance the safety of planned trajectories by ensuring equilibrium concordance among CAVs. Finally, experimental results show the advantages of the approach, including fast computation speed, high scalability, equilibrium concordance, and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDRF: Enhanced Driving Risk Field Based on Multimodal Trajectory Prediction and Its Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14996v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving risk assessment is crucial for both autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles. The driving risk can be quantified as the product of the probability that an event (such as collision) will occur and the consequence of that event. However, the probability of events occurring is often difficult to predict due to the uncertainty of drivers' or vehicles' behavior. Traditional methods generally employ kinematic-based approaches to predict the future trajectories of entities, which often yield unrealistic prediction results. In this paper, the Enhanced Driving Risk Field (EDRF) model is proposed, integrating deep learning-based multimodal trajectory prediction results with Gaussian distribution models to quantitatively capture the uncertainty of traffic entities' behavior. The applications of the EDRF are also proposed. It is applied across various tasks (traffic risk monitoring, ego-vehicle risk analysis, and motion and trajectory planning) through the defined concept Interaction Risk (IR). Adequate example scenarios are provided for each application to illustrate the effectiveness of the model.</p></details> |  |

| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIMformer: Single-Layer Vanilla Transformer Can Learn Free-Space Trajectory Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14629v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-space trajectory similarity calculation, e.g., DTW, Hausdorff, and Frechet, often incur quadratic time complexity, thus learning-based methods have been proposed to accelerate the computation. The core idea is to train an encoder to transform trajectories into representation vectors and then compute vector similarity to approximate the ground truth. However, existing methods face dual challenges of effectiveness and efficiency: 1) they all utilize Euclidean distance to compute representation similarity, which leads to the severe curse of dimensionality issue -- reducing the distinguishability among representations and significantly affecting the accuracy of subsequent similarity search tasks; 2) most of them are trained in triplets manner and often necessitate additional information which downgrades the efficiency; 3) previous studies, while emphasizing the scalability in terms of efficiency, overlooked the deterioration of effectiveness when the dataset size grows. To cope with these issues, we propose a simple, yet accurate, fast, scalable model that only uses a single-layer vanilla transformer encoder as the feature extractor and employs tailored representation similarity functions to approximate various ground truth similarity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly mitigates the curse of dimensionality issue and outperforms the state-of-the-arts in effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

| **[PTR: A Pre-trained Language Model for Trajectory Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is vital for web-of-things services and is extensively collected and analyzed by web-based hardware and platforms. However, issues such as service interruptions and network instability often lead to sparsely recorded trajectories, resulting in a loss of detailed movement data. As a result, recovering these trajectories to restore missing information becomes essential. Despite progress, several challenges remain unresolved. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data hampers the performance of existing deep learning methods, which rely heavily on abundant data for supervised training. Second, current methods struggle to generalize across sparse trajectories with varying sampling intervals, necessitating separate re-training for each interval and increasing computational costs. Third, external factors crucial for the recovery of missing points are not fully incorporated. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called PTR. This framework mitigates the issue of limited dense trajectory data by leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs). PTR incorporates an explicit trajectory prompt and is trained on datasets with multiple sampling intervals, enabling it to generalize effectively across different intervals in sparse trajectories. To capture external factors, we introduce an implicit trajectory prompt that models road conditions, providing richer information for recovering missing points. Additionally, we present a trajectory embedder that encodes trajectory points and transforms the embeddings of both observed and missing points into a format comprehensible to PLMs. Experimental results on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of PTR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Enhanced Multi-View Trajectory Representation Learning: Bridging the Gap through Self-Supervised Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13196v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling trajectory data with generic-purpose dense representations has become a prevalent paradigm for various downstream applications, such as trajectory classification, travel time estimation and similarity computation. However, existing methods typically rely on trajectories from a single spatial view, limiting their ability to capture the rich contextual information that is crucial for gaining deeper insights into movement patterns across different geospatial contexts. To this end, we propose MVTraj, a novel multi-view modeling method for trajectory representation learning. MVTraj integrates diverse contextual knowledge, from GPS to road network and points-of-interest to provide a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory data. To align the learning process across multiple views, we utilize GPS trajectories as a bridge and employ self-supervised pretext tasks to capture and distinguish movement patterns across different spatial views. Following this, we treat trajectories from different views as distinct modalities and apply a hierarchical cross-modal interaction module to fuse the representations, thereby enriching the knowledge derived from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MVTraj significantly outperforms existing baselines in tasks associated with various spatial views, validating its effectiveness and practical utility in spatio-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  |

Current air traffic control systems fail to consider spoken instructions for traffic prediction, bringing significant challenges in detecting human errors during real-time traffic operations. Here, we present an automation paradigm integrating controlling intent into the information processing loop through the spoken instruction-aware flight trajectory prediction framework. A 3-stage progressive multi-modal learning paradigm is proposed to address the modality gap between the trajectory and spoken instructions, as well as minimize the data requirements. Experiments on a real-world dataset show the proposed framework achieves flight trajectory prediction with high predictability and timeliness, obtaining over 20% relative reduction in mean deviation error. Moreover, the generalizability of the proposed framework is also confirmed by various model architectures. The proposed framework can formulate full-automated information processing in real-world air traffic applications, supporting human error detection and enhancing aviation safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in principle by Nature Communications</p></details> |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating Policies from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic tasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration trajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a hypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to learn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors of the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the benefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires fewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD achieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while using models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD generates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in long action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPF-EMPC Planner: A real-time multi-robot trajectory planner for complex environments with uncertainties](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13573v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical applications, the unpredictable movement of obstacles and the imprecise state observation of robots introduce significant uncertainties for the swarm of robots, especially in cluster environments. However, existing methods are difficult to realize safe navigation, considering uncertainties, complex environmental structures, and robot swarms. This paper introduces an extended state model predictive control planner with a safe probability field to address the multi-robot navigation problem in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. Initially, the safe probability field offers an innovative approach to model the uncertainty of external dynamic obstacles, combining it with an unconstrained optimization method to generate safe trajectories for multi-robot online. Subsequently, the extended state model predictive controller can accurately track these generated trajectories while considering the robots' inherent model constraints and state uncertainty, thus ensuring the practical feasibility of the planned trajectories. Simulation experiments show a success rate four times higher than that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Physical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to operate in real-time, enabling safe navigation for multi-robot in uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Truncating Trajectories in Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation: an Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13463v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy evaluation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is at the core of many MC Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms (e.g., policy gradient methods). In this context, the designer of the learning system specifies an interaction budget that the agent usually spends by collecting trajectories of fixed length within a simulator. However, is this data collection strategy the best option? To answer this question, in this paper, we propose as a quality index a surrogate of the mean squared error of a return estimator that uses trajectories of different lengths, i.e., \emph{truncated}. Specifically, this surrogate shows the sub-optimality of the fixed-length trajectory schedule. Furthermore, it suggests that adaptive data collection strategies that spend the available budget sequentially can allocate a larger portion of transitions in timesteps in which more accurate sampling is required to reduce the error of the final estimate. Building on these findings, we present an adaptive algorithm called Robust and Iterative Data collection strategy Optimization (RIDO). The main intuition behind RIDO is to split the available interaction budget into mini-batches. At each round, the agent determines the most convenient schedule of trajectories that minimizes an empirical and robust version of the surrogate of the estimator's error. After discussing the theoretical properties of our method, we conclude by assessing its performance across multiple domains. Our results show that RIDO can adapt its trajectory schedule toward timesteps where more sampling is required to increase the quality of the final estimation.</p></details> |  |

Existing lightweight, low-cost, bearing measurements-based methods with a single antenna-receiver sensor system configurations necessitate in situ rotations, leading to substantial measurement acquisition times restricting searchable areas and number of measurements. We propose a GyroCopter for the task. Our approach plans the trajectory of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whilst utilizing UAV flight dynamics to execute a constant gyration motion to derive "pseudo-bearing" measurements to track RF sources. The gyration-based pseudo-bearing approach: i) significantly reduces the limitations associated with in situ rotation bearing; while ii) capitalizing on the simplicity, affordability, and lightweight nature of signal strength measurement acquisition hardware to estimate bearings. This method distinguishes itself from other pseudo-bearing approaches by eliminating the need for additional hardware to maintain simplicity, lightweightness and cost-effectiveness. To validate our approach, we derived the optimal rotation speed and conducted extensive simulations and field missions with our GyroCopter to track and localize multiple RF sources. The results confirm the effectiveness of our method, highlighting its potential as a practical and rapid solution for RF source localization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>For a...</summary><p>For a demonstration video, see https://youtu.be/OkmmQjD74Us</p></details> |

However, existing approaches only operate on static structures, neglecting the fact that physical systems are always dynamic in nature. In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models (GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of 3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it requires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical symmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We theoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels can lead to density with desired symmetry, and develop a novel transition kernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention. Furthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional generation, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the forward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in various scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian motion. Empirical results on a wide suite of metrics demonstrate that GeoTDM can generate realistic geometric trajectories with significantly higher quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024. 29 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

An Optimal Transport Analysis of Occupancy Measure Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09113v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising successes of RL are propelled by combining smart algorithmic strategies and deep architectures to optimize the distribution of returns and visitations over the state-action space. A quantitative framework to compare the learning processes of these eclectic RL algorithms is currently absent but desired in practice. We address this gap by representing the learning process of an RL algorithm as a sequence of policies generated during training, and then studying the policy trajectory induced in the manifold of state-action occupancy measures. Using an optimal transport-based metric, we measure the length of the paths induced by the policy sequence yielded by an RL algorithm between an initial policy and a final optimal policy. Hence, we first define the 'Effort of Sequential Learning' (ESL). ESL quantifies the relative distance that an RL algorithm travels compared to the shortest path from the initial to the optimal policy. Further, we connect the dynamics of policies in the occupancy measure space and regret (another metric to understand the suboptimality of an RL algorithm), by defining the 'Optimal Movement Ratio' (OMR). OMR assesses the fraction of movements in the occupancy measure space that effectively reduce an analogue of regret. Finally, we derive approximation guarantees to estimate ESL and OMR with finite number of samples and without access to an optimal policy. Through empirical analyses across various environments and algorithms, we demonstrate that ESL and OMR provide insights into the exploration processes of RL algorithms and hardness of different tasks in discrete and continuous MDPs.</p></details> |  |

Despite some efforts, existing approaches still struggle with rapid planning in high-dimensional, complex problems. Not surprisingly, the primary challenge arises from the high-dimensionality of the search space, specifically the trajectory space. We address this issue with a two-step method: initially, we identify a lower-dimensional trajectory manifold {\it offline}, comprising diverse trajectories specifically relevant to the task at hand while meeting kinodynamic constraints. Subsequently, we search for solutions within this manifold {\it online}, significantly enhancing the planning speed. To encode and generate a manifold of continuous-time, differentiable trajectories, we propose a novel neural network model, {\it Differentiable Motion Manifold Primitives (DMMP)}, along with a practical training strategy. Experiments with a 7-DoF robot arm tasked with dynamic throwing to arbitrary target positions demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in planning speed, task success, and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Among other approaches, learning-based warm-starting represents an appealing paradigm for solving the trajectory generation problem, effectively combining the benefits of optimization- and data-driven methods. Current approaches for learning-based trajectory generation often focus on fixed, single-scenario environments, where key scene characteristics, such as obstacle positions or final-time requirements, remain constant across problem instances. However, practical trajectory generation requires the scenario to be frequently reconfigured, making the single-scenario approach a potentially impractical solution. To address this challenge, we present a novel trajectory generation framework that generalizes across diverse problem configurations, by leveraging high-capacity transformer neural networks capable of learning from multimodal data sources. Specifically, our approach integrates transformer-based neural network models into the trajectory optimization process, encoding both scene-level information (e.g., obstacle locations, initial and goal states) and trajectory-level constraints (e.g., time bounds, fuel consumption targets) via multimodal representations. The transformer network then generates near-optimal initial guesses for non-convex optimization problems, significantly enhancing convergence speed and performance. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a free-flyer platform, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 80% reduction in infeasible cases with respect to traditional approaches, and demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenario variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to 2025 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |

However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contour Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |

Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |

Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training.

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |

The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

However, many trajectory prediction models produce unreasonable trajectory samples that focus on improving diversity or accuracy while neglecting other key requirements, such as collision avoidance with the surrounding environment. In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory prediction method using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectory prediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidance term for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectory predictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, while adhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints. We demonstrate the utility of our model through experiments on the nuScenes and PFSD datasets and provide an extensive benchmark analysis against the SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as inpreceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Trajectory Optimization on Matrix Lie Groups via Lie-Algebraic Differential Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02018v3)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Matrix Lie groups are an important class of manifolds commonly used in control and robotics, and optimizing control policies on these manifolds is a fundamental problem. In this work, we propose a novel computationally efficient approach for trajectory optimization on matrix Lie groups using an augmented Lagrangian-based constrained discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). The method involves lifting the optimization problem to the Lie algebra during the backward pass and retracting back to the manifold during the forward pass. Unlike previous approaches that addressed constraint handling only for specific classes of matrix Lie groups, the proposed method provides a general solution for nonlinear constraint handling across generic matrix Lie groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDP method in handling constraints within a mechanical system characterized by rigid body dynamics in SE(3), assessing its computational efficiency compared to existing direct optimization solvers. Additionally, the method demonstrates robustness under external disturbances when applied as a Lie-algebraic feedback control policy on SE(3), and in optimizing a quadrotor's trajectory in a challenging realistic scenario. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively manages general constraints defined on configuration, velocity, and inputs during optimization, while also maintaining stability under external disturbances when executing the resultant control policy in closed-loop.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[DragEntity: Trajectory Guided Video Generation using Entity and Positional Relationships](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10751v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, diffusion models have achieved tremendous success in the field of video generation, with controllable video generation receiving significant attention. However, existing control methods still face two limitations: Firstly, control conditions (such as depth maps, 3D Mesh) are difficult for ordinary users to obtain directly. Secondly, it's challenging to drive multiple objects through complex motions with multiple trajectories simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce DragEntity, a video generation model that utilizes entity representation for controlling the motion of multiple objects. Compared to previous methods, DragEntity offers two main advantages: 1) Our method is more user-friendly for interaction because it allows users to drag entities within the image rather than individual pixels. 2) We use entity representation to represent any object in the image, and multiple objects can maintain relative spatial relationships. Therefore, we allow multiple trajectories to control multiple objects in the image with different levels of complexity simultaneously. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of DragEntity, demonstrating its excellent performance in fine-grained control in video generation.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 Oral |

Prior works typically neglect to maintain uncertainty about occluded objects and only predict trajectories of observed objects using high-capacity models such as Transformers trained on large datasets. While these approaches are effective in standard scenarios, they can struggle to generalize to the long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we explore a conceptual framework unifying trajectory prediction and occlusion reasoning under the same class of structured probabilistic generative model, namely, switching dynamical systems. We then present some initial experiments illustrating its capabilities using the Waymo open dataset.</p></details> |  |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Distribution of Probe Traffic Volume Estimated without Trajectory Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15274v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, passively recorded probe traffic volumes have increasingly been used to estimate traffic volumes. However, it is not always possible to count probe traffic volume in a spatial dataset when probe trajectories cannot be fully reconstructed from raw probe point location data due to sparse recording intervals, lack of pseudonyms or timestamps. As a result, the application of such probe point location data has been limited in traffic volume estimation. To relax these constraints, we present the exact distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume in a road segment based on probe point location data without trajectory reconstruction. The distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume can exhibit multimodality, without necessarily being line-symmetric with respect to the true probe traffic volume. As more probes are present, the distribution approaches a normal distribution. The conformity of the distribution was visualised through numerical simulations. Sometimes, there exists a local optimal cordon length that maximises estimation precision. The theoretical variance of estimated probe traffic volume can address heteroscedasticity in the modelling of traffic volume estimates.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Generative inpainting of incomplete Euclidean distance matrices of trajectories generated by a fractional Brownian motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07029v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) features both randomness and strong scale-free correlations, challenging generative models to reproduce the intrinsic memory characterizing the underlying stochastic process. Here we examine a zoo of diffusion-based inpainting methods on a specific dataset of corrupted images, which represent incomplete Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation readily reproduces the built-in correlations of fBm paths in different memory regimes (i.e., for sub-, Brownian and super-diffusion trajectories), providing a robust tool for the statistical imputation at high missing ratio. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to memorize samples from the training database, we demonstrate that diffusion behaves qualitatively different from the database search and thus generalize rather than memorize the training dataset. As a biological application, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model for the imputation of microscopy-derived distance matrices of chromosomal segments (FISH data) - incomplete due to experimental imperfections - and demonstrate its superiority over the standard approaches used in bioinformatics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation. Experimental results show that proposed method outperforms latest generative models and the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) on both talking-face videos and moving-body videos in terms of both objective and subjective quality.

Conventional stochastic trajectory prediction methods utilize latent variables to represent the multi-modality of vessel motion, however, tends to overlook the complexity and dynamics inherent in maritime behavior. In contrast, we explicitly simulate the transition of vessel motion from uncertainty towards a state of certainty, effectively handling future indeterminacy in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we present a novel framework (\textit{DiffuTraj}) to conceptualize the trajectory prediction task as a guided reverse process of motion pattern uncertainty diffusion, in which we progressively remove uncertainty from maritime regions to delineate the intended trajectory. Specifically, we encode the previous states of the target vessel, vessel-vessel interactions, and the environment context as guiding factors for trajectory generation. Subsequently, we devise a transformer-based conditional denoiser to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, enabling the generation of trajectories better aligned for particular maritime environment. Comprehensive experiments on vessel trajectory prediction benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>conta...</summary><p>containing 14pages, 9 figures and 3 tables; Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems on 17-June-2024</p></details> |

This paper explores the indirect method of trajectory optimization, emphasizing its application in creating optimal periodic gaits for legged systems and contrasting it with the more commonly used direct method. While the direct method provides considerable flexibility in its implementation, it is limited by its input space parameterization. In contrast, the indirect method improves accuracy by defining control inputs as functions of the system's states and costates. We tackle the convergence challenges associated with indirect shooting methods, particularly through the systematic development of gait libraries by utilizing numerical continuation methods. Our contributions include: (1) the formalization of a general periodic trajectory optimization problem that extends existing first-order necessary conditions for a broader range of cost functions and operating conditions; (2) a methodology for efficiently generating libraries of optimal trajectories (gaits) utilizing a single shooting approach combined with numerical continuation methods, including a novel approach for reconstructing Lagrange multipliers and costates from passive gaits; and (3) a comparative analysis of the indirect and direct shooting methods using a compass-gait walker as a case study, demonstrating the former's superior accuracy in generating optimal gaits. The findings underscore the potential of the indirect method for generating families of optimal gaits, thereby advancing the field of trajectory optimization in legged robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP) framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures, under review</p></details> |

We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted paper on https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/accepted-papers/</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel model for representing high dimensional spatiotemporal trajectories as sequences of discrete locations and encoding them with a Transformer-based neural network architecture. Similar to language models, our Sequence Transformer for Agent Representation Encodings (STARE) model can learn representations and structure in trajectory data through both supervisory tasks (e.g., classification), and self-supervisory tasks (e.g., masked modelling). We present experimental results on various synthetic and real trajectory datasets and show that our proposed model can learn meaningful encodings that are useful for many downstream tasks including discriminating between labels and indicating similarity between locations. Using these encodings, we also learn relationships between agents and locations present in spatiotemporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to be presented at GeoAI workshop at ACM SigSpatial 2024</p></details> |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning domain/task-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer models? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. By utilizing the pre-trained diffusion as a prior, source domain trajectories can be transformed to match with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process implicitly corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in the source data, and allowing flexible incorporation with various downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |

NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |

We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |

This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

Furthermore, they need to know the uncertainty of the predictions for risk assessment to provide safe path planning. This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Local trajectory is obtained as a numerical solution of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. Collision avoidance may be provided by adding repulsive potential of the obstacles to the cost function of MPC. We develop an approach, where repulsive potential is estimated by the neural model. We propose and explore three possible strategies of handling dynamic obstacles. First, environment with dynamic obstacles is considered as a sequence of static environments. Second, the neural model predict a sequence of repulsive potential at once. Third, the neural model predict future repulsive potential step by step in autoregressive mode. We implement these strategies and compare it with CIAO* and MPPI using BenchMR framework. First two strategies showed higher performance than CIAO* and MPPI while preserving safety constraints. The third strategy was a bit slower, however it still satisfy time limits. We deploy our approach on Husky UGV mobile platform, which move through the office corridors under proposed MPC local trajectory planner.

A rigorous stability proof is presented and explicit computation of the finite-time is provided. For tracking objective, we demonstrate the results taking an S-shaped trajectory inclined towards collision avoidance applications. Simulation validation in real time using Gazebo-ROS on a Mecanum robot model is carried out which complies with the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

While prior works mostly rely on human feedback in the form of comparisons, language is a preferable modality that provides more informative insights into user preferences. In this work, we aim to incorporate comparative language feedback to iteratively improve robot trajectories and to learn reward functions that encode human preferences. To achieve this goal, we learn a shared latent space that integrates trajectory data and language feedback, and subsequently leverage the learned latent space to improve trajectories and learn human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate comparative language feedback into reward learning. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned latent space and the success of our learning algorithms. We also conduct human subject studies that show our reward learning algorithm achieves a 23.9% higher subjective score on average and is 11.3% more time-efficient compared to preference-based reward learning, underscoring the superior performance of our method.

In this paper, we study the problem of computing joint torques and grasping forces for time-optimal motion of an object, while ensuring that the grasp is not lost and any constraints on the motion of the object, either due to dynamics, environment contact, or no-slip requirements, are also satisfied. We present a second-order cone program (SOCP) formulation of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem that considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the hand-object and object-environment contacts. Since SOCPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved optimally in polynomial time using interior point methods, we can solve the trajectory optimization problem efficiently. We present simulation results on three examples, including a non-prehensile manipulation task, which shows the generality and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[PREDICT: Preference Reasoning by Evaluating Decomposed preferences Inferred from Candidate Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06273v1)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accommodating human preferences is essential for creating AI agents that deliver personalized and effective interactions. Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new text-domain environment (PLUME). PREDICT more accurately infers nuanced human preferences improving over existing baselines by 66.2\% (gridworld environment) and 41.0\% (PLUME).</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Collaborative Filtering to Detect Anomalies in Human Semantic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18427v3)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p></details> |  |

However, the diversity of interaction modes, keyboard sizes, and visual feedback in these environments introduces divergent word-gesture trajectory data patterns, thus leading to complexity in decoding trajectories into text. Template-matching decoding methods, such as SHARK^2, are commonly used for these WGK systems because they are easy to implement and configure. However, these methods are susceptible to decoding inaccuracies for noisy trajectories. While conventional neural-network-based decoders (neural decoders) trained on word-gesture trajectory data have been proposed to improve accuracy, they have their own limitations: they require extensive data for training and deep-learning expertise for implementation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution that combines ease of implementation with high decoding accuracy: a generalizable neural decoder enabled by pre-training on large-scale coarsely discretized word-gesture trajectories. This approach produces a ready-to-use WGK decoder that is generalizable across mid-air and on-surface WGK systems in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which is evident by a robust average Top-4 accuracy of 90.4% on four diverse datasets. It significantly outperforms SHARK^2 with a 37.2% enhancement and surpasses the conventional neural decoder by 7.4%. Moreover, the Pre-trained Neural Decoder's size is only 4 MB after quantization, without sacrificing accuracy, and it can operate in real-time, executing in just 97 milliseconds on Quest 3.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Cyclists' Visual Preferences Through Shared Bike Trajectories and Street View Images Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03148v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cycling has gained global popularity for its health benefits and positive urban impacts. To effectively promote cycling, early studies have extensively investigated the relationship between cycling behaviors and environmental factors, especially cyclists' preferences when making route decisions. However, these studies often struggle to comprehensively describe detailed cycling procedures at a large scale due to data limitations, and they tend to overlook the complex nature of cyclists' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed to quantify and interpret cyclists' complicated visual preferences by leveraging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning(MEDIRL)and explainable artificial intelligence(XAI). Implemented in Bantian Sub-district, Shenzhen, we adapt MEDIRL model for efficient estimation of cycling reward function by integrating dockless-bike-sharing(DBS) trajectory and street view images(SVIs), which serves as a representation of cyclists' preferences for street visual environments during routing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MEDIRL in discovering cyclists' visual preferences. We find that cyclists focus on specific street visual elements when making route decisions, which can be summarized as their attention to safety, street enclosure, and cycling comfort. Further analysis reveals the complex nonlinear effects of street visual elements on cyclists' preferences, offering a cost-effective perspective on streetscapes design. Our proposed framework advances the understanding of individual cycling behaviors and provides actionable insights for urban planners to design bicycle-friendly streetscapes that prioritize cyclists' preferences.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Deterministic Trajectory Optimization through Probabilistic Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13316v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article proposes two new algorithms tailored to discrete-time deterministic finite-horizon nonlinear optimal control problems or so-called trajectory optimization problems. Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Continuous Dynamic Modeling via Neural ODEs for Popularity Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18742v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popularity prediction for information cascades has significant applications across various domains, including opinion monitoring and advertising recommendations. While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v5)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods. Therefore, it is shown that LeTO provides a practical example of how to achieve the integration of neural networks with trajectory optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> |  |

Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories.

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ackno...</summary><p>acknowledgement added</p></details> |

For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6(+1)...</summary><p>6(+1) pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

| **[Influential Language Data Selection via Gradient Trajectory Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16710v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Time Warping-based imputation of long gaps in human mobility trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16096v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual mobility trajectories are difficult to measure and often incur long periods of missingness. Aggregation of this mobility data without accounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating travel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple Imputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility trajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This method reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel behavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the dynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series preceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes values multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal parameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods are applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with simulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling missingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when gaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps become longer and when more data are available.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Critical Example Mining for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction using Flow-based Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16083v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise trajectory prediction in complex driving scenarios is essential for autonomous vehicles. In practice, different driving scenarios present varying levels of difficulty for trajectory prediction models. However, most existing research focuses on the average precision of prediction results, while ignoring the underlying distribution of the input scenarios. This paper proposes a critical example mining method that utilizes a data-driven approach to estimate the rareness of the trajectories. By combining the rareness estimation of observations with whole trajectories, the proposed method effectively identifies a subset of data that is relatively hard to predict BEFORE feeding them to a specific prediction model. The experimental results show that the mined subset has higher prediction error when applied to different downstream prediction models, which reaches +108.1% error (greater than two times compared to the average on dataset) when mining 5% samples. Further analysis indicates that the mined critical examples include uncommon cases such as sudden brake and cancelled lane-change, which helps to better understand and improve the performance of prediction models.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |
| **[FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. Our results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. For standardized evaluation, we introduce MPEv2, an enhanced version of Multi Particle Environments (MPE), consisting of 12 benchmarks. Benchmarks, implementations, and trained models are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. The results demonstrated the significant superiority of the proposed methods over the baselines in terms of the closed-loop metrics.

| **[Deep Active Learning with Manifold-preserving Trajectory Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15605v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning (AL) is for optimizing the selection of unlabeled data for annotation (labeling), aiming to enhance model performance while minimizing labeling effort. The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

| **[A Semi-decentralized and Variational-Equilibrium-Based Trajectory Planner for Connected and Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15394v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper designs a novel trajectory planning approach to resolve the computational efficiency and safety problems in uncoordinated methods by exploiting vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology. The trajectory planning for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) is formulated as a game with coupled safety constraints. We then define interaction-fair trajectories and prove that they correspond to the variational equilibrium (VE) of this game. We propose a semi-decentralized planner for the vehicles to seek VE-based fair trajectories, which can significantly improve computational efficiency through parallel computing among CAVs and enhance the safety of planned trajectories by ensuring equilibrium concordance among CAVs. Finally, experimental results show the advantages of the approach, including fast computation speed, high scalability, equilibrium concordance, and safety.</p></details> |  |

The driving risk can be quantified as the product of the probability that an event (such as collision) will occur and the consequence of that event. However, the probability of events occurring is often difficult to predict due to the uncertainty of drivers' or vehicles' behavior. Traditional methods generally employ kinematic-based approaches to predict the future trajectories of entities, which often yield unrealistic prediction results. In this paper, the Enhanced Driving Risk Field (EDRF) model is proposed, integrating deep learning-based multimodal trajectory prediction results with Gaussian distribution models to quantitatively capture the uncertainty of traffic entities' behavior. The applications of the EDRF are also proposed. It is applied across various tasks (traffic risk monitoring, ego-vehicle risk analysis, and motion and trajectory planning) through the defined concept Interaction Risk (IR). Adequate example scenarios are provided for each application to illustrate the effectiveness of the model.</p></details> |  |

| **[TR-LLM: Integrating Trajectory Data for Scene-Aware LLM-Based Human Action Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03993v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is crucial for AI systems to effectively support real-world applications, such as autonomous robots anticipating and assisting with human tasks. Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIMformer: Single-Layer Vanilla Transformer Can Learn Free-Space Trajectory Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14629v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-space trajectory similarity calculation, e.g., DTW, Hausdorff, and Frechet, often incur quadratic time complexity, thus learning-based methods have been proposed to accelerate the computation. The core idea is to train an encoder to transform trajectories into representation vectors and then compute vector similarity to approximate the ground truth. However, existing methods face dual challenges of effectiveness and efficiency: 1) they all utilize Euclidean distance to compute representation similarity, which leads to the severe curse of dimensionality issue -- reducing the distinguishability among representations and significantly affecting the accuracy of subsequent similarity search tasks; 2) most of them are trained in triplets manner and often necessitate additional information which downgrades the efficiency; 3) previous studies, while emphasizing the scalability in terms of efficiency, overlooked the deterioration of effectiveness when the dataset size grows. To cope with these issues, we propose a simple, yet accurate, fast, scalable model that only uses a single-layer vanilla transformer encoder as the feature extractor and employs tailored representation similarity functions to approximate various ground truth similarity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly mitigates the curse of dimensionality issue and outperforms the state-of-the-arts in effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

However, issues such as service interruptions and network instability often lead to sparsely recorded trajectories, resulting in a loss of detailed movement data. As a result, recovering these trajectories to restore missing information becomes essential. Despite progress, several challenges remain unresolved. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data hampers the performance of existing deep learning methods, which rely heavily on abundant data for supervised training. Second, current methods struggle to generalize across sparse trajectories with varying sampling intervals, necessitating separate re-training for each interval and increasing computational costs. Third, external factors crucial for the recovery of missing points are not fully incorporated. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called PTR. This framework mitigates the issue of limited dense trajectory data by leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs). PTR incorporates an explicit trajectory prompt and is trained on datasets with multiple sampling intervals, enabling it to generalize effectively across different intervals in sparse trajectories. To capture external factors, we introduce an implicit trajectory prompt that models road conditions, providing richer information for recovering missing points. Additionally, we present a trajectory embedder that encodes trajectory points and transforms the embeddings of both observed and missing points into a format comprehensible to PLMs. Experimental results on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of PTR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Enhanced Multi-View Trajectory Representation Learning: Bridging the Gap through Self-Supervised Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13196v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling trajectory data with generic-purpose dense representations has become a prevalent paradigm for various downstream applications, such as trajectory classification, travel time estimation and similarity computation. However, existing methods typically rely on trajectories from a single spatial view, limiting their ability to capture the rich contextual information that is crucial for gaining deeper insights into movement patterns across different geospatial contexts. To this end, we propose MVTraj, a novel multi-view modeling method for trajectory representation learning. MVTraj integrates diverse contextual knowledge, from GPS to road network and points-of-interest to provide a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory data. To align the learning process across multiple views, we utilize GPS trajectories as a bridge and employ self-supervised pretext tasks to capture and distinguish movement patterns across different spatial views. Following this, we treat trajectories from different views as distinct modalities and apply a hierarchical cross-modal interaction module to fuse the representations, thereby enriching the knowledge derived from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MVTraj significantly outperforms existing baselines in tasks associated with various spatial views, validating its effectiveness and practical utility in spatio-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  |

Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic tasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration trajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a hypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to learn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors of the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the benefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires fewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD achieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while using models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD generates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in long action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are difficult to realize safe navigation, considering uncertainties, complex environmental structures, and robot swarms. This paper introduces an extended state model predictive control planner with a safe probability field to address the multi-robot navigation problem in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. Initially, the safe probability field offers an innovative approach to model the uncertainty of external dynamic obstacles, combining it with an unconstrained optimization method to generate safe trajectories for multi-robot online. Subsequently, the extended state model predictive controller can accurately track these generated trajectories while considering the robots' inherent model constraints and state uncertainty, thus ensuring the practical feasibility of the planned trajectories. Simulation experiments show a success rate four times higher than that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Physical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to operate in real-time, enabling safe navigation for multi-robot in uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Truncating Trajectories in Monte Carlo Policy Evaluation: an Adaptive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13463v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy evaluation via Monte Carlo (MC) simulation is at the core of many MC Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms (e.g., policy gradient methods). In this context, the designer of the learning system specifies an interaction budget that the agent usually spends by collecting trajectories of fixed length within a simulator. However, is this data collection strategy the best option? To answer this question, in this paper, we propose as a quality index a surrogate of the mean squared error of a return estimator that uses trajectories of different lengths, i.e., \emph{truncated}. Specifically, this surrogate shows the sub-optimality of the fixed-length trajectory schedule. Furthermore, it suggests that adaptive data collection strategies that spend the available budget sequentially can allocate a larger portion of transitions in timesteps in which more accurate sampling is required to reduce the error of the final estimate. Building on these findings, we present an adaptive algorithm called Robust and Iterative Data collection strategy Optimization (RIDO). The main intuition behind RIDO is to split the available interaction budget into mini-batches. At each round, the agent determines the most convenient schedule of trajectories that minimizes an empirical and robust version of the surrogate of the estimator's error. After discussing the theoretical properties of our method, we conclude by assessing its performance across multiple domains. Our results show that RIDO can adapt its trajectory schedule toward timesteps where more sampling is required to increase the quality of the final estimation.</p></details> |  |

Existing lightweight, low-cost, bearing measurements-based methods with a single antenna-receiver sensor system configurations necessitate in situ rotations, leading to substantial measurement acquisition times restricting searchable areas and number of measurements. We propose a GyroCopter for the task. Our approach plans the trajectory of a multi-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) whilst utilizing UAV flight dynamics to execute a constant gyration motion to derive "pseudo-bearing" measurements to track RF sources. The gyration-based pseudo-bearing approach: i) significantly reduces the limitations associated with in situ rotation bearing; while ii) capitalizing on the simplicity, affordability, and lightweight nature of signal strength measurement acquisition hardware to estimate bearings. This method distinguishes itself from other pseudo-bearing approaches by eliminating the need for additional hardware to maintain simplicity, lightweightness and cost-effectiveness.

| **[Geometric Trajectory Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13027v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative models have shown great promise in generating 3D geometric systems, which is a fundamental problem in many natural science domains such as molecule and protein design. However, existing approaches only operate on static structures, neglecting the fact that physical systems are always dynamic in nature. In this work, we propose geometric trajectory diffusion models (GeoTDM), the first diffusion model for modeling the temporal distribution of 3D geometric trajectories. Modeling such distribution is challenging as it requires capturing both the complex spatial interactions with physical symmetries and temporal correspondence encapsulated in the dynamics. We theoretically justify that diffusion models with equivariant temporal kernels can lead to density with desired symmetry, and develop a novel transition kernel leveraging SE(3)-equivariant spatial convolution and temporal attention. Furthermore, to induce an expressive trajectory distribution for conditional generation, we introduce a generalized learnable geometric prior into the forward diffusion process to enhance temporal conditioning. We conduct extensive experiments on both unconditional and conditional generation in various scenarios, including physical simulation, molecular dynamics, and pedestrian motion. Empirical results on a wide suite of metrics demonstrate that GeoTDM can generate realistic geometric trajectories with significantly higher quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2024. 29 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

After pre-processing the input GPS data, human mobility traces are modeled as multidimensional curves using Functional Data Analysis (FDA). Then, the synthesis process identifies the K-nearest trajectories and averages their Square-Root Velocity Functions (SRVFs) to generate synthetic data.

Although applied for human mobility research, FDASynthesis is highly adaptable to different types of functional data, offering a scalable solution in various application domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[How does Your RL Agent Explore? An Optimal Transport Analysis of Occupancy Measure Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09113v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising successes of RL are propelled by combining smart algorithmic strategies and deep architectures to optimize the distribution of returns and visitations over the state-action space. A quantitative framework to compare the learning processes of these eclectic RL algorithms is currently absent but desired in practice. We address this gap by representing the learning process of an RL algorithm as a sequence of policies generated during training, and then studying the policy trajectory induced in the manifold of state-action occupancy measures. Using an optimal transport-based metric, we measure the length of the paths induced by the policy sequence yielded by an RL algorithm between an initial policy and a final optimal policy. Hence, we first define the 'Effort of Sequential Learning' (ESL). ESL quantifies the relative distance that an RL algorithm travels compared to the shortest path from the initial to the optimal policy. Further, we connect the dynamics of policies in the occupancy measure space and regret (another metric to understand the suboptimality of an RL algorithm), by defining the 'Optimal Movement Ratio' (OMR). OMR assesses the fraction of movements in the occupancy measure space that effectively reduce an analogue of regret. Finally, we derive approximation guarantees to estimate ESL and OMR with finite number of samples and without access to an optimal policy. Through empirical analyses across various environments and algorithms, we demonstrate that ESL and OMR provide insights into the exploration processes of RL algorithms and hardness of different tasks in discrete and continuous MDPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Manifold Optimization for Fast and Adaptive Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12193v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast kinodynamic motion planning is crucial for systems to effectively adapt to dynamically changing environments. Despite some efforts, existing approaches still struggle with rapid planning in high-dimensional, complex problems. Not surprisingly, the primary challenge arises from the high-dimensionality of the search space, specifically the trajectory space. We address this issue with a two-step method: initially, we identify a lower-dimensional trajectory manifold {\it offline}, comprising diverse trajectories specifically relevant to the task at hand while meeting kinodynamic constraints. Subsequently, we search for solutions within this manifold {\it online}, significantly enhancing the planning speed. To encode and generate a manifold of continuous-time, differentiable trajectories, we propose a novel neural network model, {\it Differentiable Motion Manifold Primitives (DMMP)}, along with a practical training strategy. Experiments with a 7-DoF robot arm tasked with dynamic throwing to arbitrary target positions demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in planning speed, task success, and constraint satisfaction.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |

Among other approaches, learning-based warm-starting represents an appealing paradigm for solving the trajectory generation problem, effectively combining the benefits of optimization- and data-driven methods. Current approaches for learning-based trajectory generation often focus on fixed, single-scenario environments, where key scene characteristics, such as obstacle positions or final-time requirements, remain constant across problem instances. However, practical trajectory generation requires the scenario to be frequently reconfigured, making the single-scenario approach a potentially impractical solution. To address this challenge, we present a novel trajectory generation framework that generalizes across diverse problem configurations, by leveraging high-capacity transformer neural networks capable of learning from multimodal data sources. Specifically, our approach integrates transformer-based neural network models into the trajectory optimization process, encoding both scene-level information (e.g., obstacle locations, initial and goal states) and trajectory-level constraints (e.g., time bounds, fuel consumption targets) via multimodal representations. The transformer network then generates near-optimal initial guesses for non-convex optimization problems, significantly enhancing convergence speed and performance. The framework is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments on a free-flyer platform, achieving up to 30% cost improvement and 80% reduction in infeasible cases with respect to traditional approaches, and demonstrating robust generalization across diverse scenario variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to 2025 American Control Conference (ACC)</p></details> |

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.

| **[A Data-Driven Aggressive Autonomous Racing Framework Utilizing Local Trajectory Planning with Velocity Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11570v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of autonomous driving has boosted the research on autonomous racing. However, existing local trajectory planning methods have difficulty planning trajectories with optimal velocity profiles at racetracks with sharp corners, thus weakening the performance of autonomous racing. To address this problem, we propose a local trajectory planning method that integrates Velocity Prediction based on Model Predictive Contour Control (VPMPCC). The optimal parameters of VPMPCC are learned through Bayesian Optimization (BO) based on a proposed novel Objective Function adapted to Racing (OFR). Specifically, VPMPCC achieves velocity prediction by encoding the racetrack as a reference velocity profile and incorporating it into the optimization problem. This method optimizes the velocity profile of local trajectories, especially at corners with significant curvature. The proposed OFR balances racing performance with vehicle safety, ensuring safe and efficient BO training. In the simulation, the number of training iterations for OFR-based BO is reduced by 42.86% compared to the state-of-the-art method. The optimal simulation-trained parameters are then applied to a real-world F1TENTH vehicle without retraining. During prolonged racing on a custom-built racetrack featuring significant sharp corners, the mean velocity of VPMPCC reaches 93.18% of the vehicle's handling limits. The released code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/VPMPCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explaining Learned Reward Functions with Counterfactual Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04856v4)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning rewards from human behaviour or feedback is a promising approach to aligning AI systems with human values but fails to consistently extract correct reward functions. Interpretability tools could enable users to understand and evaluate possible flaws in learned reward functions. We propose Counterfactual Trajectory Explanations (CTEs) to interpret reward functions in reinforcement learning by contrasting an original with a counterfactual partial trajectory and the rewards they each receive. We derive six quality criteria for CTEs and propose a novel Monte-Carlo-based algorithm for generating CTEs that optimises these quality criteria. Finally, we measure how informative the generated explanations are to a proxy-human model by training it on CTEs. CTEs are demonstrably informative for the proxy-human model, increasing the similarity between its predictions and the reward function on unseen trajectories. Further, it learns to accurately judge differences in rewards between trajectories and generalises to out-of-distribution examples. Although CTEs do not lead to a perfect understanding of the reward, our method, and more generally the adaptation of XAI methods, are presented as a fruitful approach for interpreting learned reward functions.</p></details> |  |

However, recent studies have raised concerns regarding the hallucination and flaws in their reasoning process. Substantial efforts are being made to improve the reliability and faithfulness of the generated rationales. Some approaches model reasoning as planning, while others focus on annotating for process supervision. Nevertheless, the planning-based search process often results in high latency due to the frequent assessment of intermediate reasoning states and the extensive exploration space. Additionally, supervising the reasoning process with human annotation is costly and challenging to scale for LLM training. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose a framework to learn planning-based reasoning through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on collected trajectories, which are ranked according to synthesized process rewards. Our results on challenging logical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our learning framework, showing that our 7B model can surpass the strong counterparts like GPT-3.5-Turbo.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures.

Despite significant achievements in complex robotic locomotion and skills, mobile manipulation-a capability that requires the coordination of navigation and manipulation-remains a challenge for generative AI techniques. This is primarily due to the high-dimensional action space, extended motion trajectories, and interactions with the surrounding environment. In this paper, we introduce M2Diffuser, a diffusion-based, scene-conditioned generative model that directly generates coordinated and efficient whole-body motion trajectories for mobile manipulation based on robot-centric 3D scans. M2Diffuser first learns trajectory-level distributions from mobile manipulation trajectories provided by an expert planner. Crucially, it incorporates an optimization module that can flexibly accommodate physical constraints and task objectives, modeled as cost and energy functions, during the inference process. This enables the reduction of physical violations and execution errors at each denoising step in a fully differentiable manner. Through benchmarking on three types of mobile manipulation tasks across over 20 scenes, we demonstrate that M2Diffuser outperforms state-of-the-art neural planners and successfully transfers the generated trajectories to a real-world robot. Our evaluations underscore the potential of generative AI to enhance the generalization of traditional planning and learning-based robotic methods, while also highlighting the critical role of enforcing physical constraints for safe and robust execution.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that combines the Dreamer algorithm's ability to generate anticipatory trajectories with the adaptive learning strengths of the Online Decision Transformer. Our methodology enables parallel training where Dreamer-produced trajectories enhance the contextual decision-making of the transformer, creating a bidirectional enhancement loop. We empirically demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on a suite of challenging benchmarks, achieving notable improvements in sample efficiency and reward maximization over existing methods. Our results indicate that the proposed integrated framework not only accelerates learning but also showcases robustness in diverse and dynamic scenarios, marking a significant step forward in model-based reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

In this work, we propose TrajDiffuse, a planning-based trajectory prediction method using a novel guided conditional diffusion model. We form the trajectory prediction problem as a denoising impaint task and design a map-based guidance term for the diffusion process. TrajDiffuse is able to generate trajectory predictions that match or exceed the accuracy and diversity of the SOTA, while adhering almost perfectly to environmental constraints. We demonstrate the utility of our model through experiments on the nuScenes and PFSD datasets and provide an extensive benchmark analysis against the SOTA methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as inpreceedings of the 2024 International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR)</p></details> |

In this work, we propose a novel computationally efficient approach for trajectory optimization on matrix Lie groups using an augmented Lagrangian-based constrained discrete Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP). The method involves lifting the optimization problem to the Lie algebra during the backward pass and retracting back to the manifold during the forward pass. Unlike previous approaches that addressed constraint handling only for specific classes of matrix Lie groups, the proposed method provides a general solution for nonlinear constraint handling across generic matrix Lie groups. We evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed DDP method in handling constraints within a mechanical system characterized by rigid body dynamics in SE(3), assessing its computational efficiency compared to existing direct optimization solvers. Additionally, the method demonstrates robustness under external disturbances when applied as a Lie-algebraic feedback control policy on SE(3), and in optimizing a quadrotor's trajectory in a challenging realistic scenario. Experiments show that the proposed approach effectively manages general constraints defined on configuration, velocity, and inputs during optimization, while also maintaining stability under external disturbances when executing the resultant control policy in closed-loop.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing control methods still face two limitations: Firstly, control conditions (such as depth maps, 3D Mesh) are difficult for ordinary users to obtain directly. Secondly, it's challenging to drive multiple objects through complex motions with multiple trajectories simultaneously. In this paper, we introduce DragEntity, a video generation model that utilizes entity representation for controlling the motion of multiple objects. Compared to previous methods, DragEntity offers two main advantages: 1) Our method is more user-friendly for interaction because it allows users to drag entities within the image rather than individual pixels. 2) We use entity representation to represent any object in the image, and multiple objects can maintain relative spatial relationships. Therefore, we allow multiple trajectories to control multiple objects in the image with different levels of complexity simultaneously. Our experiments validate the effectiveness of DragEntity, demonstrating its excellent performance in fine-grained control in video generation.</p></details> | ACM MM2024 Oral |

Prior works typically neglect to maintain uncertainty about occluded objects and only predict trajectories of observed objects using high-capacity models such as Transformers trained on large datasets. While these approaches are effective in standard scenarios, they can struggle to generalize to the long-tail, safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we explore a conceptual framework unifying trajectory prediction and occlusion reasoning under the same class of structured probabilistic generative model, namely, switching dynamical systems. We then present some initial experiments illustrating its capabilities using the Waymo open dataset.</p></details> |  |

Ergodic trajectory optimization is an effective approach that generates coverage paths for problems related to robotic inspection, information gathering problems, and search and rescue. These optimization schemes compel the robot to spend time in a region proportional to the expected utility of visiting that region. Current methods for ergodic trajectory optimization rely on domain-specific knowledge, e.g., a defined utility map, and well-defined spatial basis functions to produce ergodic trajectories. Here, we present a generalization of ergodic trajectory optimization based on maximum mean discrepancy that requires only samples from the search domain. We demonstrate the ability of our approach to produce coverage trajectories on a variety of problem domains including robotic inspection of objects with differential kinematics constraints and on Lie groups without having access to domain specific knowledge. Furthermore, we show favorable computational scaling compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for ergodic trajectory optimization with a trade-off between domain specific knowledge and computational scaling, thus extending the versatility of ergodic coverage on a wider application domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages (excluding references), 1 table, 8 figures, submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[On the Distribution of Probe Traffic Volume Estimated without Trajectory Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15274v2)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, passively recorded probe traffic volumes have increasingly been used to estimate traffic volumes. However, it is not always possible to count probe traffic volume in a spatial dataset when probe trajectories cannot be fully reconstructed from raw probe point location data due to sparse recording intervals, lack of pseudonyms or timestamps. As a result, the application of such probe point location data has been limited in traffic volume estimation. To relax these constraints, we present the exact distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume in a road segment based on probe point location data without trajectory reconstruction. The distribution of the estimated probe traffic volume can exhibit multimodality, without necessarily being line-symmetric with respect to the true probe traffic volume. As more probes are present, the distribution approaches a normal distribution. The conformity of the distribution was visualised through numerical simulations. Sometimes, there exists a local optimal cordon length that maximises estimation precision. The theoretical variance of estimated probe traffic volume can address heteroscedasticity in the modelling of traffic volume estimates.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Here we examine a zoo of diffusion-based inpainting methods on a specific dataset of corrupted images, which represent incomplete Euclidean distance matrices (EDMs) of fBm at various memory exponents $H$. Our dataset implies uniqueness of the data imputation in the regime of low missing ratio, where the remaining partial graph is rigid, providing the ground truth for the inpainting. We find that the conditional diffusion generation readily reproduces the built-in correlations of fBm paths in different memory regimes (i.e., for sub-, Brownian and super-diffusion trajectories), providing a robust tool for the statistical imputation at high missing ratio. Furthermore, while diffusion models have been recently shown to memorize samples from the training database, we demonstrate that diffusion behaves qualitatively different from the database search and thus generalize rather than memorize the training dataset. As a biological application, we apply our fBm-trained diffusion model for the imputation of microscopy-derived distance matrices of chromosomal segments (FISH data) - incomplete due to experimental imperfections - and demonstrate its superiority over the standard approaches used in bioinformatics.</p></details> |  |

In particular, the proposed motion factorization strategy can facilitate to implicitly characterize the high-dimensional visual signal into compact motion vectors for representation compactness and further transform these vectors into a fine-grained field for motion expressibility. As such, the coded bit-stream can be entailed with enough visual motion information at the lowest representation cost. Meanwhile, a resolution-expandable generative module is developed with enhanced background stability, such that the proposed framework can be optimized towards higher reconstruction robustness and more flexible resolution adaptation.

In this paper, we present a novel framework (\textit{DiffuTraj}) to conceptualize the trajectory prediction task as a guided reverse process of motion pattern uncertainty diffusion, in which we progressively remove uncertainty from maritime regions to delineate the intended trajectory. Specifically, we encode the previous states of the target vessel, vessel-vessel interactions, and the environment context as guiding factors for trajectory generation. Subsequently, we devise a transformer-based conditional denoiser to capture spatio-temporal dependencies, enabling the generation of trajectories better aligned for particular maritime environment.

This paper explores the indirect method of trajectory optimization, emphasizing its application in creating optimal periodic gaits for legged systems and contrasting it with the more commonly used direct method. While the direct method provides considerable flexibility in its implementation, it is limited by its input space parameterization. In contrast, the indirect method improves accuracy by defining control inputs as functions of the system's states and costates. We tackle the convergence challenges associated with indirect shooting methods, particularly through the systematic development of gait libraries by utilizing numerical continuation methods. Our contributions include: (1) the formalization of a general periodic trajectory optimization problem that extends existing first-order necessary conditions for a broader range of cost functions and operating conditions; (2) a methodology for efficiently generating libraries of optimal trajectories (gaits) utilizing a single shooting approach combined with numerical continuation methods, including a novel approach for reconstructing Lagrange multipliers and costates from passive gaits; and (3) a comparative analysis of the indirect and direct shooting methods using a compass-gait walker as a case study, demonstrating the former's superior accuracy in generating optimal gaits. The findings underscore the potential of the indirect method for generating families of optimal gaits, thereby advancing the field of trajectory optimization in legged robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to the International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |

Recent manifold learning-based methods have partially addressed the dimensionality and dataset size issues, but struggle with the complex text-conditional distribution. In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory generation model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on only a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage recent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional distributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but rather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold, with deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions and robustness to text variations. We show that our Motion Manifold Flow Primitive (MMFP) framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct motions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 15 figures, under review</p></details> |

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted paper on https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/accepted-papers/</p></details> |
| **[Encoding Agent Trajectories as Representations with Sequence Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09204v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal data faces many analogous challenges to natural language text including the ordering of locations (words) in a sequence, long range dependencies between locations, and locations having multiple meanings. In this work, we propose a novel model for representing high dimensional spatiotemporal trajectories as sequences of discrete locations and encoding them with a Transformer-based neural network architecture. Similar to language models, our Sequence Transformer for Agent Representation Encodings (STARE) model can learn representations and structure in trajectory data through both supervisory tasks (e.g., classification), and self-supervisory tasks (e.g., masked modelling). We present experimental results on various synthetic and real trajectory datasets and show that our proposed model can learn meaningful encodings that are useful for many downstream tasks including discriminating between labels and indicating similarity between locations. Using these encodings, we also learn relationships between agents and locations present in spatiotemporal data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to be presented at GeoAI workshop at ACM SigSpatial 2024</p></details> |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning domain/task-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer models? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. By utilizing the pre-trained diffusion as a prior, source domain trajectories can be transformed to match with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process implicitly corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in the source data, and allowing flexible incorporation with various downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08780v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The joint optimization of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and camera trajectories has been widely applied in SLAM tasks due to its superior dense mapping quality and consistency. NeRF-based SLAM learns camera poses using constraints by implicit map representation. A widely observed phenomenon that results from the constraints of this form is jerky and physically unrealistic estimated camera motion, which in turn affects the map quality. To address this deficiency of current NeRF-based SLAM, we propose in this paper TS-SLAM (TS for Trajectory Smoothness). It introduces smoothness constraints on camera trajectories by representing them with uniform cubic B-splines with continuous acceleration that guarantees smooth camera motion. Benefiting from the differentiability and local control properties of B-splines, TS-SLAM can incrementally learn the control points end-to-end using a sliding window paradigm. Additionally, we regularize camera trajectories by exploiting the dynamics prior to further smooth trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that TS-SLAM achieves superior trajectory accuracy and improves mapping quality versus NeRF-based SLAM that does not employ the above smoothness constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear second-order dynamics describe labial constriction trajectories across languages and contexts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08351v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the dynamics of labial constriction trajectories during the production of /b/ and /m/ in English and Mandarin. We find that, across languages and contexts, the ratio of instantaneous displacement to instantaneous velocity generally follows an exponential decay curve from movement onset to movement offset. We formalize this empirical discovery in a differential equation and, in combination with an assumption of point attractor dynamics, derive a nonlinear second-order dynamical system describing labial constriction trajectories. The equation has only two parameters, T and r. T corresponds to the target state and r corresponds to movement rapidity. Thus, each of the parameters corresponds to a phonetically relevant dimension of control. Nonlinear regression demonstrates that the model provides excellent fits to individual movement trajectories. Moreover, trajectories simulated from the model qualitatively match empirical trajectories, and capture key kinematic variables like duration, peak velocity, and time to achieve peak velocity. The model constitutes a proposal for the dynamics of individual articulatory movements, and thus offers a novel foundation from which to understand additional influences on articulatory kinematics like prosody, inter-movement coordination, and stochastic noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v4)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

Leveraging a novel annotation pipeline, we are able to scale the annotated trajectories and generate a trajectory dataset with minimized difficulty bias. Furthermore, we fine-tune LLMs on AgentBank to get a series of agent models, Samoyed.

| **[Reliable Probabilistic Human Trajectory Prediction for Autonomous Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06905v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems, like vehicles or robots, require reliable, accurate, fast, resource-efficient, scalable, and low-latency trajectory predictions to get initial knowledge about future locations and movements of surrounding objects for safe human-machine interaction. Furthermore, they need to know the uncertainty of the predictions for risk assessment to provide safe path planning. This paper presents a lightweight method to address these requirements, combining Long Short-Term Memory and Mixture Density Networks. Our method predicts probability distributions, including confidence level estimations for positional uncertainty to support subsequent risk management applications and runs on a low-power embedded platform. We discuss essential requirements for human trajectory prediction in autonomous vehicle applications and demonstrate our method's performance using multiple traffic-related datasets. Furthermore, we explain reliability and sharpness metrics and show how important they are to guarantee the correctness and robustness of a model's predictions and uncertainty assessments. These essential evaluations have so far received little attention for no good reason. Our approach focuses entirely on real-world applicability. Verifying prediction uncertainties and a model's reliability are central to autonomous real-world applications.

| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applications such as image editing and restoration. The success of DMs lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. This work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates LLMs' ability to estimate probability density functions (PDFs) from data observed in-context; such density estimation (DE) is a fundamental task underlying many probabilistic modeling problems. We leverage the Intensive Principal Component Analysis (InPCA) to visualize and analyze the in-context learning dynamics of LLaMA-2 models. Our main finding is that these LLMs all follow similar learning trajectories in a low-dimensional InPCA space, which are distinct from those of traditional density estimation methods like histograms and Gaussian kernel density estimation (KDE). We interpret the LLaMA in-context DE process as a KDE with an adaptive kernel width and shape. This custom kernel model captures a significant portion of LLaMA's behavior despite having only two parameters. We further speculate on why LLaMA's kernel width and shape differs from classical algorithms, providing insights into the mechanism of in-context probabilistic reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

By posing the finite-horizon optimal control problem and recursive re-evaluation of the optimal trajectories, minimization of the L2 norms of the state and control errors are transcribed into a quadratic program. Control and state variable constraints are parameterized using Chebyshev polynomials and are accommodated in the optimal trajectory generation programs to incorporate the actuator limits and keepout constraints. Differentiable collision detection of polytopes is leveraged for optimal collision avoidance. Results obtained from the collocation methods are benchmarked against the existing approaches on an edge computer to outline the performance improvements. Finally, collaborative control scenarios involving multi-agent space systems are considered to demonstrate the technical merits of the proposed work.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE ACC 2025 for possible publication</p></details> |

Local trajectory is obtained as a numerical solution of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) problem. Collision avoidance may be provided by adding repulsive potential of the obstacles to the cost function of MPC. We develop an approach, where repulsive potential is estimated by the neural model. We propose and explore three possible strategies of handling dynamic obstacles. First, environment with dynamic obstacles is considered as a sequence of static environments. Second, the neural model predict a sequence of repulsive potential at once. Third, the neural model predict future repulsive potential step by step in autoregressive mode. We implement these strategies and compare it with CIAO* and MPPI using BenchMR framework. First two strategies showed higher performance than CIAO* and MPPI while preserving safety constraints. The third strategy was a bit slower, however it still satisfy time limits. We deploy our approach on Husky UGV mobile platform, which move through the office corridors under proposed MPC local trajectory planner.

While prior works mostly rely on human feedback in the form of comparisons, language is a preferable modality that provides more informative insights into user preferences. In this work, we aim to incorporate comparative language feedback to iteratively improve robot trajectories and to learn reward functions that encode human preferences. To achieve this goal, we learn a shared latent space that integrates trajectory data and language feedback, and subsequently leverage the learned latent space to improve trajectories and learn human preferences. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to incorporate comparative language feedback into reward learning. Our simulation experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned latent space and the success of our learning algorithms. We also conduct human subject studies that show our reward learning algorithm achieves a 23.9% higher subjective score on average and is 11.3% more time-efficient compared to preference-based reward learning, underscoring the superior performance of our method.

In this paper, we study the problem of computing joint torques and grasping forces for time-optimal motion of an object, while ensuring that the grasp is not lost and any constraints on the motion of the object, either due to dynamics, environment contact, or no-slip requirements, are also satisfied. We present a second-order cone program (SOCP) formulation of the time-optimal trajectory planning problem that considers nonlinear friction cone constraints at the hand-object and object-environment contacts. Since SOCPs are convex optimization problems that can be solved optimally in polynomial time using interior point methods, we can solve the trajectory optimization problem efficiently. We present simulation results on three examples, including a non-prehensile manipulation task, which shows the generality and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Recent work has shown the potential for LLMs to infer preferences from user interactions, but they often produce broad and generic preferences, failing to capture the unique and individualized nature of human preferences. This paper introduces PREDICT, a method designed to enhance the precision and adaptability of inferring preferences. PREDICT incorporates three key elements: (1) iterative refinement of inferred preferences, (2) decomposition of preferences into constituent components, and (3) validation of preferences across multiple trajectories. We evaluate PREDICT on two distinct environments: a gridworld setting and a new text-domain environment (PLUME). PREDICT more accurately infers nuanced human preferences improving over existing baselines by 66.2\% (gridworld environment) and 41.0\% (PLUME).</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Collaborative Filtering to Detect Anomalies in Human Semantic Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18427v3)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory anomaly detection has become increasingly important across a wide range of applications, including security surveillance and public health. However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper particularly focuses on generating sequences of images from the photorealistic Gaussian Splatting models, that match instructions that are given by user-inputted language. We contribute a novel framework, SplaTraj, which formulates the generation of images within photorealistic environment representations as a continuous-time trajectory optimization problem. Costs are designed so that a camera following the trajectory poses will smoothly traverse through the environment and render the specified spatial information in a photogenic manner. This is achieved by querying a photorealistic representation with language embedding to isolate regions that correspond to the user-specified inputs. These regions are then projected to the camera's view as it moves over time and a cost is constructed. We can then apply gradient-based optimization and differentiate through the rendering to optimize the trajectory for the defined cost. The resulting trajectory moves to photogenically view each of the specified objects. We empirically evaluate our approach on a suite of environments and instructions, and demonstrate the quality of generated image sequences.</p></details> |  |

However, the diversity of interaction modes, keyboard sizes, and visual feedback in these environments introduces divergent word-gesture trajectory data patterns, thus leading to complexity in decoding trajectories into text. Template-matching decoding methods, such as SHARK^2, are commonly used for these WGK systems because they are easy to implement and configure. However, these methods are susceptible to decoding inaccuracies for noisy trajectories. While conventional neural-network-based decoders (neural decoders) trained on word-gesture trajectory data have been proposed to improve accuracy, they have their own limitations: they require extensive data for training and deep-learning expertise for implementation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel solution that combines ease of implementation with high decoding accuracy: a generalizable neural decoder enabled by pre-training on large-scale coarsely discretized word-gesture trajectories. This approach produces a ready-to-use WGK decoder that is generalizable across mid-air and on-surface WGK systems in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), which is evident by a robust average Top-4 accuracy of 90.4% on four diverse datasets. It significantly outperforms SHARK^2 with a 37.2% enhancement and surpasses the conventional neural decoder by 7.4%. Moreover, the Pre-trained Neural Decoder's size is only 4 MB after quantization, without sacrificing accuracy, and it can operate in real-time, executing in just 97 milliseconds on Quest 3.</p></details> |  |

To effectively promote cycling, early studies have extensively investigated the relationship between cycling behaviors and environmental factors, especially cyclists' preferences when making route decisions. However, these studies often struggle to comprehensively describe detailed cycling procedures at a large scale due to data limitations, and they tend to overlook the complex nature of cyclists' preferences. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework aimed to quantify and interpret cyclists' complicated visual preferences by leveraging maximum entropy deep inverse reinforcement learning(MEDIRL)and explainable artificial intelligence(XAI). Implemented in Bantian Sub-district, Shenzhen, we adapt MEDIRL model for efficient estimation of cycling reward function by integrating dockless-bike-sharing(DBS) trajectory and street view images(SVIs), which serves as a representation of cyclists' preferences for street visual environments during routing. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of MEDIRL in discovering cyclists' visual preferences. We find that cyclists focus on specific street visual elements when making route decisions, which can be summarized as their attention to safety, street enclosure, and cycling comfort. Further analysis reveals the complex nonlinear effects of street visual elements on cyclists' preferences, offering a cost-effective perspective on streetscapes design. Our proposed framework advances the understanding of individual cycling behaviors and provides actionable insights for urban planners to design bicycle-friendly streetscapes that prioritize cyclists' preferences.</p></details> | 39 pages, 16 figures |

Both algorithms are inspired by a novel theoretical paradigm known as probabilistic optimal control, that reformulates optimal control as an equivalent probabilistic inference problem. This perspective allows to address the problem using the Expectation-Maximization algorithm. We show that the application of this algorithm results in a fixed point iteration of probabilistic policies that converge to the deterministic optimal policy. Two strategies for policy evaluation are discussed, using state-of-the-art uncertainty quantification methods resulting into two distinct algorithms. The algorithms are structurally closest related to the differential dynamic programming algorithm and related methods that use sigma-point methods to avoid direct gradient evaluations. The main advantage of our work is an improved balance between exploration and exploitation over the iterations, leading to improved numerical stability and accelerated convergence. These properties are demonstrated on different nonlinear systems.</p></details> |  |

However, pretrained LLMs such as ChatGPT are periodically evolved, i.e., model parameters are frequently updated), making it challenging for downstream users with limited resources to keep up with fine-tuning the newest LLMs for their domain application. Even though fine-tuning costs have nowadays been reduced thanks to the innovations of parameter-efficient fine-tuning such as LoRA, not all downstream users have adequate computing for frequent personalization. Moreover, access to fine-tuning datasets, particularly in sensitive domains such as healthcare, could be time-restrictive, making it crucial to retain the knowledge encoded in earlier fine-tuned rounds for future adaptation. In this paper, we present PortLLM, a training-free framework that (i) creates an initial lightweight model update patch to capture domain-specific knowledge, and (ii) allows a subsequent seamless plugging for the continual personalization of evolved LLM at minimal cost. Our extensive experiments cover seven representative datasets, from easier question-answering tasks {BoolQ, SST2} to harder reasoning tasks {WinoGrande, GSM8K}, and models including {Mistral-7B, Llama2, Llama3.1, and Gemma2}, validating the portability of our designed model patches and showcasing the effectiveness of our proposed framework. For instance, PortLLM achieves comparable performance to LoRA fine-tuning with reductions of up to 12.2x in GPU memory usage. Finally, we provide theoretical justifications to understand the portability of our model update patches, which offers new insights into the theoretical dimension of LLMs' personalization.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods usually break this task into multiple subtasks, each requiring complex transformations between different data representations. For instance, dense reconstruction through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) involves converting images into key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures. Afterward, accurate sparse reconstructions are required for further dense modeling, which is subsequently fed into task-specific neural networks. This multi-step process results in considerable processing time and increased engineering complexity. In this work, we present the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which processes unposed RGB images directly into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneously estimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward operation, and it can generate versatile label maps by interacting with language at novel viewpoints. Leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, LSM integrates global geometry through pixel-aligned point maps. To enhance spatial attribute regression, we incorporate local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, improving the accuracy of fine local details. To tackle the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field. An efficient decoder then parameterizes a set of semantic anisotropic Gaussians, facilitating supervised end-to-end learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that LSM unifies multiple 3D vision tasks directly from unposed images, achieving real-time semantic 3D reconstruction for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://largespatialmodel.github.io</p></details> |

However, we observe that existing safety benchmarks for MLLMs show limitations in query quality and evaluation reliability limiting the detection of model safety implications as MLLMs continue to evolve. In this paper, we propose \toolns, a comprehensive framework designed for conducting safety evaluations of MLLMs. Our framework consists of a comprehensive harmful query dataset and an automated evaluation protocol that aims to address the above limitations, respectively. We first design an automatic safety dataset generation pipeline, where we employ a set of LLM judges to recognize and categorize the risk scenarios that are most harmful and diverse for MLLMs; based on the taxonomy, we further ask these judges to generate high-quality harmful queries accordingly resulting in 23 risk scenarios with 2,300 multi-modal harmful query pairs. During safety evaluation, we draw inspiration from the jury system in judicial proceedings and pioneer the jury deliberation evaluation protocol that adopts collaborative LLMs to evaluate whether target models exhibit specific harmful behaviors, providing a reliable and unbiased assessment of content security risks. In addition, our benchmark can also be extended to the audio modality showing high scalability and potential. Based on our framework, we conducted large-scale experiments on 15 widely-used open-source MLLMs and 6 commercial MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o, Gemini), where we revealed widespread safety issues in existing MLLMs and instantiated several insights on MLLM safety performance such as image quality and parameter size.</p></details> |  |

While various methods have been proposed to elicit the preferences of such models, countermeasures have been taken by LLM trainers, such that LLMs hide, obfuscate or point blank refuse to disclosure their positions on certain subjects. This paper presents PRISM, a flexible, inquiry-based methodology for auditing LLMs - that seeks to illicit such positions indirectly through task-based inquiry prompting rather than direct inquiry of said preferences. To demonstrate the utility of the methodology, we applied PRISM on the Political Compass Test, where we assessed the political leanings of twenty-one LLMs from seven providers. We show LLMs, by default, espouse positions that are economically left and socially liberal (consistent with prior work). We also show the space of positions that these models are willing to espouse - where some models are more constrained and less compliant than others - while others are more neutral and objective. In sum, PRISM can more reliably probe and audit LLMs to understand their preferences, biases and constraints.</p></details> |  |

This results in prolonged diagnoses and a lack of approved therapies. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering potential to improve medical diagnosis and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning rare diseases, and struggle to handle the latest rare disease information. They also cannot effectively manage rare disease data and are not directly suitable for diagnosis and management tasks. Our objective is to create an end-to-end system called AutoRD, which automates the extraction of information from medical texts about rare diseases, focusing on entities and their relations. AutoRD integrates up-to-date structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conduct various experiments to evaluate AutoRD's performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Small-Scale Large Language Models Function Calling for Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18890v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in natural language understanding and generation. While these models excel in general complex reasoning tasks, they still face challenges in mathematical problem-solving and logical reasoning. To address these limitations, researchers have explored function calling abilities, allowing LLMs to execute provided functions and utilize their outputs for task completion. However, concentrating on specific tasks can be very inefficient for large-scale LLMs to be used, because of the expensive cost of training and inference stages they need in terms of computational resources. This study introduces a novel framework for training smaller language models in function calling, focusing on specific logical and mathematical reasoning tasks. The approach aims to improve performances of small-scale models for these tasks using function calling, ensuring a high level of accuracy. Our framework employs an agent that, given a problem and a set of callable functions, queries the LLM by injecting a description and examples of the usable functions into the prompt and managing their calls in a step-by-step reasoning chain. This process is used to create a dataset of correct and incorrect reasoning chain chat completions from a large-scale LLM. This dataset is used to train a smaller LLM using Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), specifically employing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) technique. Experimental results demonstrate how the proposed approach balances the trade-off between model size and performance, improving the ability of function calling for reasoning tasks, in smaller models.</p></details> |  |

Their potential application spans a broad range of medical tasks, such as clinical documentation, matching patients to clinical trials, and answering medical questions. In this primer paper, we propose an actionable guideline to help healthcare professionals more efficiently utilize LLMs in their work, along with a set of best practices. This approach consists of several main phases, including formulating the task, choosing LLMs, prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and deployment. We start with the discussion of critical considerations in identifying healthcare tasks that align with the core capabilities of LLMs and selecting models based on the selected task and data, performance requirements, and model interface. We then review the strategies, such as prompt engineering and fine-tuning, to adapt standard LLMs to specialized medical tasks. Deployment considerations, including regulatory compliance, ethical guidelines, and continuous monitoring for fairness and bias, are also discussed. By providing a structured step-by-step methodology, this tutorial aims to equip healthcare professionals with the tools necessary to effectively integrate LLMs into clinical practice, ensuring that these powerful technologies are applied in a safe, reliable, and impactful manner.</p></details> |  |

A prime example is the recently debated "reversal curse", which surfaces when models, having been trained on the fact "A is B", struggle to generalize this knowledge to infer that "B is A". In this paper, we examine the manifestation of the reversal curse across various tasks and delve into both the generalization abilities and the problem-solving mechanisms of LLMs. This investigation leads to a series of significant insights: (1) LLMs are able to generalize to "B is A" when both A and B are presented in the context as in the case of a multiple-choice question. (2) This generalization ability is highly correlated to the structure of the fact "A is B" in the training documents. For example, this generalization only applies to biographies structured in "[Name] is [Description]" but not to "[Description] is [Name]". (3) We propose and verify the hypothesis that LLMs possess an inherent bias in fact recalling during knowledge application, which explains and underscores the importance of the document structure to successful learning. (4) The negative impact of this bias on the downstream performance of LLMs can hardly be mitigated through training alone. Based on these intriguing findings, our work not only presents a novel perspective for interpreting LLMs' generalization abilities from their intrinsic working mechanism but also provides new insights for the development of more effective learning methods for LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Therefore, automated tools are needed to assist human players in interpreting binary code. In recent years, two groups of technologies have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based technologies have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This makes participants wonder about the ability of LLMs in binary code understanding. In this work, we propose a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios. The benchmark covers two key binary code understanding tasks, including function name recovery and binary code summarization. We gain valuable insights into their capabilities and limitations through extensive evaluations of popular LLMs using our benchmark.

However, LLMs may suffer from spurious correlations between input texts and output labels, which limits LLMs' ability to reason based purely on general language understanding. In other words, LLMs may make predictions primarily based on premise or hypothesis, rather than both components. To address this problem that may lead to unexpected performance degradation, we propose task calibration (TC), a zero-shot and inference-only calibration method inspired by mutual information which recovers LLM performance through task reformulation. TC encourages LLMs to reason based on both premise and hypothesis, while mitigating the models' over-reliance on individual premise or hypothesis for inference. Experimental results show that TC achieves a substantial improvement on 13 inference tasks in the zero-shot setup. We further validate the effectiveness of TC in few-shot setups and various natural language understanding tasks. Further analysis indicates that TC is also robust to prompt templates and has the potential to be integrated with other calibration methods.</p></details> |  |

Despite the progress in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), which extend LLMs with visual perception and understanding capabilities, there remains a notable lack of coding benchmarks that rigorously assess these models, particularly in tasks that emphasize visual reasoning. To address this gap, we introduce HumanEval-V, a novel and lightweight benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LMMs' visual understanding and reasoning capabilities through code generation. HumanEval-V includes 108 carefully crafted, entry-level Python coding tasks derived from platforms like CodeForces and Stack Overflow. Each task is adapted by modifying the context and algorithmic patterns of the original problems, with visual elements redrawn to ensure distinction from the source, preventing potential data leakage. LMMs are required to complete the code solution based on the provided visual context and a predefined Python function signature outlining the task requirements. Every task is equipped with meticulously handcrafted test cases to ensure a thorough and reliable evaluation of model-generated solutions. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LMMs using HumanEval-V, uncovering significant challenges. Proprietary models like GPT-4o achieve only 13% pass@1 and 36.4% pass@10, while open-weight models with 70B parameters score below 4% pass@1. Ablation studies further reveal the limitations of current LMMs in vision reasoning and coding capabilities. These results underscore key areas for future research to enhance LMMs' capabilities.

Unlike traditional DNN model, the inference of LLM entails different iterations of forward computation for different queries, which result in efficiency challenges for existing run-to-completion batch-wise inference. Hence, some methods refine batch-wise inference to iteration-level by duplicating all nonlinear layers of LLM. However, this approach not only increases resource usage but also introduces idle computations to the batch due to the prefilling of newly added queries. Therefore, we propose BATON, an efficient batch-wise LLM inference scheme by dynamically adjusting processing batch, which can achieve near-zero idle computations without incurring additional resource consumption. To do so, BATON 1) shapes the vectors involved in the inference of the newly inserted query and processing batch to align dimensions and generates a new attention mask based on vector shaping to ensure inference correctness, which enables query inserting without consuming additional resource; 2) embeds prefilled Keys and Values of the new query into the KV_Cache of the processing batch by leveraging the prefilling and decoding separation mechanism, eliminating idle computations to the batch introduced by the prefilling process of the new query. Experimental results show that compared to the state-of-the-art solution Orca, BATON improves query processing by up to 1.75 times.</p></details> |  |

Hence, comprehending the citation patterns exhibited by authors is essential for assessing their research impact and contributions within their respective fields. Although the h-index, introduced by Hirsch in 2005, has emerged as a popular bibliometric indicator, it fails to account for the intricate relationships between authors and their citation patterns. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in cases where citations are strategically employed to boost the perceived influence of certain individuals or groups, a phenomenon that we term "orchestration". Orchestrated citations can introduce biases in citation rankings and therefore necessitate the identification of such patterns. Here, we use Scopus data to investigate orchestration of citations across all scientific disciplines. Orchestration could be small-scale, when the author him/herself and/or a small number of other authors use citations strategically to boost citation metrics like h-index; or large-scale, where extensive collaborations among many co-authors lead to high h-index for many/all of them. We propose three orchestration indicators: extremely low values in the ratio of citations over the square of the h-index (indicative of small-scale orchestration); extremely small number of authors who can explain at least 50% of an author's total citations (indicative of either small-scale or large-scale orchestration); and extremely large number of co-authors with more than 50 co-authored papers (indicative of large-scale orchestration). The distributions, potential thresholds based on 1% (and 5%) percentiles, and insights from these indicators are explored and put into perspective across science.</p></details> |  |

This primarily arises from LLMs not being aligned with humans, as mainstream alignment datasets typically do not include IE data. In this paper, we introduce ADELIE (Aligning large language moDELs on Information Extraction), an aligned LLM that effectively solves various IE tasks, including closed IE, open IE, and on-demand IE. We first collect and construct a high-quality alignment corpus IEInstruct for IE. Then we train ADELIE_SFT using instruction tuning on IEInstruct. We further train ADELIE_SFT with direct preference optimization (DPO) objective, resulting in ADELIE_DPO. Extensive experiments on various held-out IE datasets demonstrate that our models (ADELIE_SFT and ADELIE_DPO) achieve state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance among open-source models. We further explore the general capabilities of ADELIE, and experimental results reveal that their general capabilities do not exhibit a noticeable decline.

In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for logistic regression training on large encrypted data using Homomorphic Encryption (HE), which is the mini-batch version of recent methods using a faster gradient variant called $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$. It is claimed that $\texttt{quadratic gradient}$ can integrate curve information (Hessian matrix) into the gradient and therefore can effectively accelerate the first-order gradient (descent) algorithms. We also implement the full-batch version of their method when the encrypted dataset is so large that it has to be encrypted in the mini-batch manner. We compare our mini-batch algorithm with our full-batch implementation method on real financial data consisting of 422,108 samples with 200 freatures. %Our experiments show that Nesterov's accelerated gradient (NAG) Given the inefficiency of HEs, our results are inspiring and demonstrate that the logistic regression training on large encrypted dataset is of practical feasibility, marking a significant milestone in our understanding.</p></details> |  |

Existing LLMRec approaches prioritize text semantics, usually neglecting the valuable collaborative information from user-item interactions in recommendations. While these text-emphasizing approaches excel in cold-start scenarios, they may yield sub-optimal performance in warm-start situations. In pursuit of superior recommendations for both cold and warm start scenarios, we introduce CoLLM, an innovative LLMRec methodology that seamlessly incorporates collaborative information into LLMs for recommendation. CoLLM captures collaborative information through an external traditional model and maps it to the input token embedding space of LLM, forming collaborative embeddings for LLM usage. Through this external integration of collaborative information, CoLLM ensures effective modeling of collaborative information without modifying the LLM itself, providing the flexibility to employ various collaborative information modeling techniques.

The lack of large-scale instruction datasets and the gigapixel scale of whole slide images (WSIs) pose significant developmental challenges. In this paper, we present SlideChat, the first vision-language assistant capable of understanding gigapixel whole-slide images, exhibiting excellent multimodal conversational capability and response complex instruction across diverse pathology scenarios. To support its development, we created SlideInstruction, the largest instruction-following dataset for WSIs consisting of 4.2K WSI captions and 176K VQA pairs with multiple categories. Furthermore, we propose SlideBench, a multimodal benchmark that incorporates captioning and VQA tasks to assess SlideChat's capabilities in varied clinical settings such as microscopy, diagnosis. Compared to both general and specialized MLLMs, SlideChat exhibits exceptional capabilities achieving state-of-the-art performance on 18 of 22 tasks.

These issues hinder objective and comparable data-driven evaluations and optimizations of knowledge work assistance systems. Due to the considerable resources needed to collect such data in real-life settings and the necessity of data censorship, collecting such a dataset appears nearly impossible. For this reason, we propose a configurable, multi-agent knowledge work dataset generator. This system simulates collaborative knowledge work among agents producing Large Language Model-generated documents and accompanying data traces. Additionally, the generator captures all background information, given in its configuration or created during the simulation process, in a knowledge graph. Finally, the resulting dataset can be utilized and shared without privacy or confidentiality concerns. This paper introduces our approach's design and vision and focuses on generating authentic knowledge work documents using Large Language Models.

The relationship between marijuana consumption and alterations in brain network connectivity is a recognized fact in scientific literature. This study probes how lsAGC can accurately discern these changes. The technique used integrates dimension reduction with the augmentation of source time-series in a model that predicts time-series, which helps in estimating the directed causal relationships among fMRI time-series. As a multivariate approach, lsAGC uncovers the connection of the inherent dynamic system while considering all other time-series. A dataset of 60 adults with an ADHD diagnosis during childhood, drawn from the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initiative (ACPI), was used in the study. The brain connections assessed by lsAGC were utilized as classification attributes. A Graph Attention Neural Network (GAT) was chosen to carry out the classification task, particularly for its ability to harness graph-based data and recognize intricate interactions between brain regions, making it appropriate for fMRI-based brain connectivity data. The performance was analyzed using a five-fold cross-validation system. The average accuracy achieved by the correlation coefficient method was roughly 52.98%, with a 1.65 standard deviation, whereas the lsAGC approach yielded an average accuracy of 61.47%, with a standard deviation of 1.44. The suggested method enhances the body of knowledge in the field of neuroimaging-based classification and emphasizes the necessity to consider directed causal connections in brain network connectivity analysis when studying marijuana's effects on the brain.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Traditional wireless networks struggle to support efficiently, leading to intolerable response delays, disconnections, and resource wastage. To address these issues, we propose LLM-Slice, the first system to provide dedicated communication slices for LLMs within a wireless network environment.

This survey provides a comprehensive overview of table-related tasks, examining both user scenarios and technical aspects. It covers traditional tasks like table question answering as well as emerging fields such as spreadsheet manipulation and table data analysis. We summarize the training techniques for LLMs and VLMs tailored for table processing.

While previous works have introduced several benchmarks to evaluate the safety risk of LLMs, the community still has a limited understanding of current LLMs' capability to recognize illegal and unsafe content in Chinese contexts. In this work, we present a Chinese safety benchmark (ChineseSafe) to facilitate research on the content safety of large language models. To align with the regulations for Chinese Internet content moderation, our ChineseSafe contains 205,034 examples across 4 classes and 10 sub-classes of safety issues. For Chinese contexts, we add several special types of illegal content: political sensitivity, pornography, and variant/homophonic words. Moreover, we employ two methods to evaluate the legal risks of popular LLMs, including open-sourced models and APIs. The results reveal that many LLMs exhibit vulnerability to certain types of safety issues, leading to legal risks in China. Our work provides a guideline for developers and researchers to facilitate the safety of LLMs. Our results are also available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/SUSTech/ChineseSafe-Benchmark.</p></details> |  |

However, real-time feasibility of MPC can be challenging for complex systems, certainly when an (extremely) large number of constraints have to be adhered to. For such scenarios with a large number of state constraints, this paper proposes two novel MPC schemes for general nonlinear systems, which we call constraint-adaptive MPC. These novel schemes dynamically select at each time step a (varying) set of constraints that are included in the on-line optimization problem. Carefully selecting the included constraints can significantly reduce, as we will demonstrate, the computational complexity with often only a slight impact on the closed-loop performance. Although not all (state) constraints are imposed in the on-line optimization, the schemes still guarantee recursive feasibility and constraint satisfaction. A numerical case study illustrates the proposed MPC schemes and demonstrates the achieved computation time improvements exceeding two orders of magnitude without loss of performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, IFAC NMPC 2021 conference</p></details> |

However, despite such a promising future, there are multiple challenges and obstacles that remain for their real-world uses in practical settings. This work discusses key challenges for LLMs in medical applications from four unique aspects: operational vulnerabilities, ethical and social considerations, performance and assessment difficulties, and legal and regulatory compliance. Addressing these challenges is crucial for leveraging LLMs to their full potential and ensuring their responsible integration into healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[Head-wise Shareable Attention for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11819v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) suffer from huge number of parameters, which restricts their deployment on edge devices. Weight sharing is one promising solution that encourages weight reuse, effectively reducing memory usage with less performance drop. However, current weight sharing techniques primarily focus on small-scale models like BERT and employ coarse-grained sharing rules, e.g., layer-wise. This becomes limiting given the prevalence of LLMs and sharing an entire layer or block obviously diminishes the flexibility of weight sharing. In this paper, we present a perspective on head-wise shareable attention for large language models. We further propose two memory-efficient methods that share parameters across attention heads, with a specific focus on LLMs. Both of them use the same dynamic strategy to select the shared weight matrices. The first method directly reuses the pre-trained weights without retraining, denoted as $\textbf{DirectShare}$. The second method first post-trains with constraint on weight matrix similarity and then shares, denoted as $\textbf{PostShare}$. Experimental results reveal our head-wise shared models still maintain satisfactory capabilities, demonstrating the feasibility of fine-grained weight sharing applied to LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 21 tables, EMNLP'24 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Large Language Models for Dynamic Constraints through Human-in-the-Loop Discriminators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15163v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities across various real-world applications. However, due to the current text-in-text-out paradigm, it remains challenging for LLMs to handle dynamic and complex application constraints, let alone devise general solutions that meet predefined system goals. Current common practices like model finetuning and reflection-based reasoning often address these issues case-by-case, limiting their generalizability. To address this issue, we propose a flexible framework that enables LLMs to interact with system interfaces, summarize constraint concepts, and continually optimize performance metrics by collaborating with human experts. As a case in point, we initialized a travel planner agent by establishing constraints from evaluation interfaces. Then, we employed both LLM-based and human discriminators to identify critical cases and continuously improve agent performance until the desired outcomes were achieved. After just one iteration, our framework achieved a $7.78\%$ pass rate with the human discriminator (a $40.2\%$ improvement over baseline) and a $6.11\%$ pass rate with the LLM-based discriminator. Given the adaptability of our proposal, we believe this framework can be applied to a wide range of constraint-based applications and lay a solid foundation for model finetuning with performance-sensitive data samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Reflect the Ideology of their Creators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18417v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are trained on vast amounts of data to generate natural language, enabling them to perform tasks like text summarization and question answering. These models have become popular in artificial intelligence (AI) assistants like ChatGPT and already play an influential role in how humans access information. However, the behavior of LLMs varies depending on their design, training, and use. In this paper, we uncover notable diversity in the ideological stance exhibited across different LLMs and languages in which they are accessed. We do this by prompting a diverse panel of popular LLMs to describe a large number of prominent and controversial personalities from recent world history, both in English and in Chinese. By identifying and analyzing moral assessments reflected in the generated descriptions, we find consistent normative differences between how the same LLM responds in Chinese compared to English. Similarly, we identify normative disagreements between Western and non-Western LLMs about prominent actors in geopolitical conflicts. Furthermore, popularly hypothesized disparities in political goals among Western models are reflected in significant normative differences related to inclusion, social inequality, and political scandals. Our results show that the ideological stance of an LLM often reflects the worldview of its creators. This raises important concerns around technological and regulatory efforts with the stated aim of making LLMs ideologically `unbiased', and it poses risks for political instrumentalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable Bilingual Multimodal Large Language Model for Diverse Biomedical Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18387v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several medical Multimodal Large Languange Models (MLLMs) have been developed to address tasks involving visual images with textual instructions across various medical modalities, achieving impressive results. Most current medical generalist models are region-agnostic, treating the entire image as a holistic representation. However, they struggle to identify which specific regions they are focusing on when generating a sentence.To mimic the behavior of doctors, who typically begin by reviewing the entire image before concentrating on specific regions for a thorough evaluation, we aim to enhance the capability of medical MLLMs in understanding anatomical regions within entire medical scans. To achieve it, we first formulate Region-Centric tasks and construct a large-scale dataset, MedRegInstruct, to incorporate regional information into training. Combining our collected dataset with other medical multimodal corpora for training, we propose a Region-Aware medical MLLM, MedRegA, which is the first bilingual generalist medical AI system to simultaneously handle image-level and region-level medical vision-language tasks across a broad range of modalities. Our MedRegA not only enables three region-centric tasks, but also achieves the best performance for visual question answering, report generation and medical image classification over 8 modalities, showcasing significant versatility. Experiments demonstrate that our model can not only accomplish powerful performance across various medical vision-language tasks in bilingual settings, but also recognize and detect structures in multimodal medical scans, boosting the interpretability and user interactivity of medical MLLMs. Our project page is https://medrega.github.io.</p></details> | Technical Report |

Studies suggest that powerful LLMs, like GPT-4, are beginning to exhibit human-like cognitive abilities, including planning, reasoning, and reflection. In this paper, we introduce a research line and methodology called LLM Psychology, leveraging human psychology experiments to investigate the cognitive behaviors and mechanisms of LLMs. We migrate the Typoglycemia phenomenon from psychology to explore the "mind" of LLMs. Unlike human brains, which rely on context and word patterns to comprehend scrambled text, LLMs use distinct encoding and decoding processes. Through Typoglycemia experiments at the character, word, and sentence levels, we observe: (I) LLMs demonstrate human-like behaviors on a macro scale, such as lower task accuracy and higher token/time consumption; (II) LLMs exhibit varying robustness to scrambled input, making Typoglycemia a benchmark for model evaluation without new datasets; (III) Different task types have varying impacts, with complex logical tasks (e.g., math) being more challenging in scrambled form; (IV) Each LLM has a unique and consistent "cognitive pattern" across tasks, revealing general mechanisms in its psychology process. We provide an in-depth analysis of hidden layers to explain these phenomena, paving the way for future research in LLM Psychology and deeper interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaEDL: Early Draft Stopping for Speculative Decoding of Large Language Models via an Entropy-based Lower Bound on Token Acceptance Probability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18351v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speculative decoding is a powerful technique that attempts to circumvent the autoregressive constraint of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). The aim of speculative decoding techniques is to improve the average inference time of a large, target model without sacrificing its accuracy, by using a more efficient draft model to propose draft tokens which are then verified in parallel. The number of draft tokens produced in each drafting round is referred to as the draft length and is often a static hyperparameter chosen based on the acceptance rate statistics of the draft tokens. However, setting a static draft length can negatively impact performance, especially in scenarios where drafting is expensive and there is a high variance in the number of tokens accepted. Adaptive Entropy-based Draft Length (AdaEDL) is a simple, training and parameter-free criteria which allows for early stopping of the token drafting process by approximating a lower bound on the expected acceptance probability of the drafted token based on the currently observed entropy of the drafted logits. We show that AdaEDL consistently outperforms static draft-length speculative decoding by 10%-57% as well as other training-free draft-stopping techniques by upto 10% in a variety of settings and datasets. At the same time, we show that AdaEDL is more robust than these techniques and preserves performance in high-sampling-temperature scenarios. Since it is training-free, in contrast to techniques that rely on the training of dataset-specific draft-stopping predictors, AdaEDL can seamlessly be integrated into a variety of pre-existing LLM systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on Efficient Natural Language and Signal Processing at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Human perception is inherently multimodal, relying not only on text but also on auditory and visual cues for a complete understanding of the world. In recognition of this fact, audio-visual LLMs have recently emerged. Despite promising developments, the lack of dedicated benchmarks poses challenges for understanding and evaluating models. In this work, we show that audio-visual LLMs struggle to discern subtle relationships between audio and visual signals, leading to hallucinations, underscoring the need for reliable benchmarks. To address this, we introduce AVHBench, the first comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to evaluate the perception and comprehension capabilities of audio-visual LLMs. Our benchmark includes tests for assessing hallucinations, as well as the cross-modal matching and reasoning abilities of these models. Our results reveal that most existing audio-visual LLMs struggle with hallucinations caused by cross-interactions between modalities, due to their limited capacity to perceive complex multimodal signals and their relationships. Additionally, we demonstrate that simple training with our AVHBench improves robustness of audio-visual LLMs against hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>URL: ...</summary><p>URL: https://github.com/AVHBench/AVHBench</p></details> |
| **[CoreInfer: Accelerating Large Language Model Inference with Semantics-Inspired Adaptive Sparse Activation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18311v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters have sparked a new wave of exciting AI applications. However, their high computational costs and memory demands during inference pose significant challenges. Adaptive sparse activation inference, which activates only a small number of neurons for each token, offers a novel way to accelerate model inference without degrading performance, showing great potential for resource-constrained hardware devices. Nevertheless, existing methods predict activated neurons based on individual tokens with additional MLP, which involve frequent changes in activation maps and resource calls, limiting the acceleration benefits of sparse activation. In this paper, we introduce CoreInfer, an MLP-free adaptive sparse activation inference method based on sentence-level prediction. Specifically, we propose the concept of sentence-wise core neurons, which refers to the subset of neurons most critical for a given sentence, and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness. To determine the core neurons, we explore the correlation between core neurons and the sentence's semantics. Remarkably, we discovered that core neurons exhibit both stability and similarity in relation to the sentence's semantics -- an insight overlooked by previous studies. Building on this finding, we further design two semantic-based methods for predicting core neurons to fit different input scenarios. In CoreInfer, the core neurons are determined during the pre-filling stage and fixed during the encoding stage, enabling zero-cost sparse inference. We evaluated the model generalization and task generalization of CoreInfer across various models and tasks. Notably, on an NVIDIA TITAN XP GPU, CoreInfer achieved a 10.33 times and 2.72 times speedup compared to the Huggingface implementation and PowerInfer, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://wangqinsi1.github.io/coreinfer_page/</p></details> |
| **[Multilingual Hallucination Gaps in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18270v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as alternatives to traditional search engines given their capacity to generate text that resembles human language. However, this shift is concerning, as LLMs often generate hallucinations, misleading or false information that appears highly credible. In this study, we explore the phenomenon of hallucinations across multiple languages in freeform text generation, focusing on what we call multilingual hallucination gaps. These gaps reflect differences in the frequency of hallucinated answers depending on the prompt and language used. To quantify such hallucinations, we used the FactScore metric and extended its framework to a multilingual setting. We conducted experiments using LLMs from the LLaMA, Qwen, and Aya families, generating biographies in 19 languages and comparing the results to Wikipedia pages. Our results reveal variations in hallucination rates, especially between high and low resource languages, raising important questions about LLM multilingual performance and the challenges in evaluating hallucinations in multilingual freeform text generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdoor in Seconds: Unlocking Vulnerabilities in Large Pre-trained Models via Model Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18267v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained models have achieved notable success across a range of downstream tasks. However, recent research shows that a type of adversarial attack ($\textit{i.e.,}$ backdoor attack) can manipulate the behavior of machine learning models through contaminating their training dataset, posing significant threat in the real-world application of large pre-trained model, especially for those customized models. Therefore, addressing the unique challenges for exploring vulnerability of pre-trained models is of paramount importance. Through empirical studies on the capability for performing backdoor attack in large pre-trained models ($\textit{e.g.,}$ ViT), we find the following unique challenges of attacking large pre-trained models: 1) the inability to manipulate or even access large training datasets, and 2) the substantial computational resources required for training or fine-tuning these models. To address these challenges, we establish new standards for an effective and feasible backdoor attack in the context of large pre-trained models. In line with these standards, we introduce our EDT model, an \textbf{E}fficient, \textbf{D}ata-free, \textbf{T}raining-free backdoor attack method. Inspired by model editing techniques, EDT injects an editing-based lightweight codebook into the backdoor of large pre-trained models, which replaces the embedding of the poisoned image with the target image without poisoning the training dataset or training the victim model. Our experiments, conducted across various pre-trained models such as ViT, CLIP, BLIP, and stable diffusion, and on downstream tasks including image classification, image captioning, and image generation, demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Inference for Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18248v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance the capabilities of standalone LLMs by integrating external data sources through API calls. In interactive LLM applications, efficient scheduling is crucial for maintaining low request completion times, directly impacting user engagement. However, these augmentations introduce scheduling challenges due to the need to manage limited memory for cached information (KV caches). As a result, traditional size-based scheduling algorithms, such as Shortest Job First (SJF), become less effective at minimizing completion times. Existing work focuses only on handling requests during API calls by preserving, discarding, or swapping memory without considering how to schedule requests with API calls. In this paper, we propose LAMPS, a novel LLM inference framework for augmented LLMs. LAMPS minimizes request completion time through a unified scheduling approach that considers the total length of requests and their handling strategies during API calls. Recognizing that LLM inference is memory-bound, our approach ranks requests based on their consumption of memory over time, which depends on both the output sizes and how a request is managed during its API calls. To implement our scheduling, LAMPS predicts the strategy that minimizes memory waste of a request during its API calls, aligning with but improving upon existing approaches. We also propose starvation prevention techniques and optimizations to mitigate the overhead of our scheduling. We implement LAMPS on top of vLLM and evaluate its performance against baseline LLM inference systems, demonstrating improvements in end-to-end latency by 27%-85% and reductions in TTFT by 4%-96% compared to the existing augmented-LLM system, with even greater gains over vLLM.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods primarily focus on generating static and single-frame scenes, overlooking the inherently dynamic nature of real-world driving environments. In this work, we introduce DynamicCity, a novel 4D LiDAR generation framework capable of generating large-scale, high-quality LiDAR scenes that capture the temporal evolution of dynamic environments. DynamicCity mainly consists of two key models. 1) A VAE model for learning HexPlane as the compact 4D representation. Instead of using naive averaging operations, DynamicCity employs a novel Projection Module to effectively compress 4D LiDAR features into six 2D feature maps for HexPlane construction, which significantly enhances HexPlane fitting quality (up to 12.56 mIoU gain). Furthermore, we utilize an Expansion & Squeeze Strategy to reconstruct 3D feature volumes in parallel, which improves both network training efficiency and reconstruction accuracy than naively querying each 3D point (up to 7.05 mIoU gain, 2.06x training speedup, and 70.84% memory reduction). 2) A DiT-based diffusion model for HexPlane generation. To make HexPlane feasible for DiT generation, a Padded Rollout Operation is proposed to reorganize all six feature planes of the HexPlane as a squared 2D feature map. In particular, various conditions could be introduced in the diffusion or sampling process, supporting versatile 4D generation applications, such as trajectory- and command-driven generation, inpainting, and layout-conditioned generation. Extensive experiments on the CarlaSC and Waymo datasets demonstrate that DynamicCity significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art 4D LiDAR generation methods across multiple metrics. The code will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; 29 pages, 15 figures, 7 tables; Project Page at https://dynamic-city.github.io/</p></details> |

To this end, safeguard methods aim to enforce the ethical and responsible use of LLMs through safety alignment or guardrail mechanisms. However, we found that the malicious attackers could exploit false positives of safeguards, i.e., fooling the safeguard model to block safe content mistakenly, leading to a new denial-of-service (DoS) attack on LLMs. Specifically, by software or phishing attacks on user client software, attackers insert a short, seemingly innocuous adversarial prompt into to user prompt templates in configuration files; thus, this prompt appears in final user requests without visibility in the user interface and is not trivial to identify. By designing an optimization process that utilizes gradient and attention information, our attack can automatically generate seemingly safe adversarial prompts, approximately only 30 characters long, that universally block over 97\% of user requests on Llama Guard 3. The attack presents a new dimension of evaluating LLM safeguards focusing on false positives, fundamentally different from the classic jailbreak.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we aim to explore and understand the LLMs-based feature selection methods from a data-centric perspective. We begin by categorizing existing feature selection methods with LLMs into two groups: data-driven feature selection which requires numerical values of samples to do statistical inference and text-based feature selection which utilizes prior knowledge of LLMs to do semantical associations using descriptive context. We conduct experiments in both classification and regression tasks with LLMs in various sizes (e.g., GPT-4, ChatGPT and LLaMA-2). Our findings emphasize the effectiveness and robustness of text-based feature selection methods and showcase their potentials using a real-world medical application. We also discuss the challenges and future opportunities in employing LLMs for feature selection, offering insights for further research and development in this emerging field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD Explorations (December 2024)</p></details> |

Traditional micro-simulation frameworks are limited to main roads due to the complexity of urban mobility and large-scale data. We introduce the Large Scale Multi-GPU Parallel Computing based Regional Scale Traffic Simulation Framework (LPSim), a scalable tool that leverages GPU parallel computing to simulate extensive traffic networks with high fidelity and reduced computation time. LPSim performs millions of vehicle dynamics simulations simultaneously, outperforming CPU-based methods. It can complete simulations of 2.82 million trips in 6.28 minutes using a single GPU, and 9.01 million trips in 21.16 minutes on dual GPUs. LPSim is also tested on dual NVIDIA A100 GPUs, achieving simulations about 113 times faster than traditional CPU methods. This demonstrates its scalability and efficiency for large-scale applications, making LPSim a valuable resource for researchers and planners.

However, adapting general-purpose RAG systems to specialized fields such as science and medicine poses unique challenges due to distribution shifts and limited access to domain-specific data. To tackle this, we propose SimRAG, a self-training approach that equips the LLM with joint capabilities of question answering and question generation for domain adaptation. Our method first fine-tunes the LLM on instruction-following, question-answering, and search-related data. Then, it prompts the same LLM to generate diverse domain-relevant questions from unlabeled corpora, with an additional filtering strategy to retain high-quality synthetic examples. By leveraging these synthetic examples, the LLM can improve their performance on domain-specific RAG tasks. Experiments on 11 datasets, spanning two backbone sizes and three domains, demonstrate that SimRAG outperforms baselines by 1.2\%--8.6\%.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

Collaborative decoding between large and small language models (SLMs) presents a promising strategy to mitigate these issues through methods including speculative decoding, contrastive decoding, and emulator or proxy fine-tuning. However, the specifics of such collaborations, particularly from a unified perspective, remain largely unexplored. Inspired by dual-process cognitive theory, we propose a unified framework in this paper, termed Fast and Slow Generating (FS-GEN). Within this framework, LLMs (sometimes along with SLMs) are categorized as System 2 (slow and deliberate), while independent SLMs are designated as System 1 (fast and intuitive). We provide a comprehensive analysis of these collaborative methodologies, elucidating their common properties and shedding light on the differential knowledge capabilities of System 2 versus System 1 through the FS-GEN framework. Our findings indicate that only a small proportion of collaborative interactions (approximately less than 20\% in most instances) are necessary across various methods. These interactions between System 1 and System 2 conform to a scaling law related to the parameter ratios, enabling predictable collaboration. Furthermore, we explore the specific conditions under which collaboration proves most effective, particularly from an uncertainty perspective, offering novel insights that may guide future optimization efforts. Our research underscores that the fundamental distinction between System 1 and System 2 lies in the uncertainty of next token predictions, where interventions by System 2 are crucial to support System 1.

Existing dynamic modeling approaches, such as wave and finite element methods, often fail to accurately predict dynamic responses due to the limited capability of handling three-dimensional reflectors or the oversimplification of cable members of a reflector. This paper proposes the Cartesian spatial discretization method for dynamic modeling and vibration analysis of cable-network structures in large deployable mesh reflectors. This method defines cable member positions as a summation of internal and boundary-induced terms within a global Cartesian coordinate system. Numerical simulation on a two-dimensional cable-network structure and a center-feed mesh reflector demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method over traditional approaches, highlighting its accuracy and versatility, and establishing it as a robust tool for analyzing three-dimensional complex reflector configurations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing defense methods often struggle with two key issues: (i) inadequate defense capabilities, particularly in domain-specific scenarios like chemistry, where a lack of specialized knowledge can lead to the generation of harmful responses to malicious queries. (ii) over-defensiveness, which compromises the general utility and responsiveness of LLMs. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a multi-agents-based defense framework, Guide for Defense (G4D), which leverages accurate external information to provide an unbiased summary of user intentions and analytically grounded safety response guidance. Extensive experiments on popular jailbreak attacks and benign datasets show that our G4D can enhance LLM's robustness against jailbreak attacks on general and domain-specific scenarios without compromising the model's general functionality.</p></details> |  |

Attribution can increase trust in LLM responses: The LLM provides evidence that supports its response, which enhances verifiability. Existing approaches to attribution have only been evaluated in RAG settings, where the initial retrieval confounds LLM performance. This is crucially different from the long document setting, where retrieval is not needed, but could help. Thus, a long document specific evaluation of attribution is missing. To fill this gap, we present LAB, a benchmark of 6 diverse long document tasks with attribution, and experiments with different approaches to attribution on 5 LLMs of different sizes. We find that citation, i.e. response generation and evidence extraction in one step, performs best for large and fine-tuned models, while additional retrieval can help for small, prompted models. We investigate whether the "Lost in the Middle'' phenomenon exists for attribution, but do not find this. We also find that evidence quality can predict response quality on datasets with simple responses, but not so for complex responses, as models struggle with providing evidence for complex claims.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024.

| **[R-CoT: Reverse Chain-of-Thought Problem Generation for Geometric Reasoning in Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17885v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) struggle with mathematical geometric reasoning due to a lack of high-quality image-text paired data. Current geometric data generation approaches, which apply preset templates to generate geometric data or use Large Language Models (LLMs) to rephrase questions and answers (Q&A), unavoidably limit data accuracy and diversity. To synthesize higher-quality data, we propose a two-stage Reverse Chain-of-Thought (R-CoT) geometry problem generation pipeline. First, we introduce GeoChain to produce high-fidelity geometric images and corresponding descriptions highlighting relations among geometric elements. We then design a Reverse A&Q method that reasons step-by-step based on the descriptions and generates questions in reverse from the reasoning results. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method brings significant and consistent improvements on multiple LMM baselines, achieving new performance records in the 2B, 7B, and 8B settings. Notably, R-CoT-8B significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art open-source mathematical models by 16.6% on MathVista and 9.2% on GeoQA, while also surpassing the closed-source model GPT-4o by an average of 13% across both datasets.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in code generation tasks, they often encounter issues such as refusal to code or hallucination in geospatial code generation due to a lack of domain-specific knowledge and code corpora. To address these challenges, this paper presents and open-sources the GeoCode-PT and GeoCode-SFT corpora, along with the GeoCode-Eval evaluation dataset. Additionally, by leveraging QLoRA and LoRA for pretraining and fine-tuning, we introduce GeoCode-GPT-7B, the first LLM focused on geospatial code generation, fine-tuned from Code Llama-7B. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework, incorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineering scoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using the GeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results show that GeoCode-GPT outperforms other models in multiple-choice accuracy by 9.1% to 32.1%, in code summarization ability by 1.7% to 25.4%, and in code generation capability by 1.2% to 25.1%. This paper provides a solution and empirical validation for enhancing LLMs' performance in geospatial code generation, extends the boundaries of domain-specific model applications, and offers valuable insights into unlocking their potential in geospatial code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Have an English Accent? Evaluating and Improving the Naturalness of Multilingual LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15956v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are predominantly designed with English as the primary language, and even the few that are multilingual tend to exhibit strong English-centric biases. Much like speakers who might produce awkward expressions when learning a second language, LLMs often generate unnatural outputs in non-English languages, reflecting English-centric patterns in both vocabulary and grammar. Despite the importance of this issue, the naturalness of multilingual LLM outputs has received limited attention. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing novel automatic corpus-level metrics to assess the lexical and syntactic naturalness of LLM outputs in a multilingual context. Using our new metrics, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated benchmark in French and Chinese, revealing a tendency towards English-influenced patterns. To mitigate this issue, we also propose a simple and effective alignment method to improve the naturalness of an LLM in a target language and domain, achieving consistent improvements in naturalness without compromising the performance on general-purpose benchmarks. Our work highlights the importance of developing multilingual metrics, resources and methods for the new wave of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ShapefileGPT: A Multi-Agent Large Language Model Framework for Automated Shapefile Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12376v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector data is one of the two core data structures in geographic information science (GIS), essential for accurately storing and representing geospatial information. Shapefile, the most widely used vector data format, has become the industry standard supported by all major geographic information systems. However, processing this data typically requires specialized GIS knowledge and skills, creating a barrier for researchers from other fields and impeding interdisciplinary research in spatial data analysis. Moreover, while large language models (LLMs) have made significant advancements in natural language processing and task automation, they still face challenges in handling the complex spatial and topological relationships inherent in GIS vector data. To address these challenges, we propose ShapefileGPT, an innovative framework powered by LLMs, specifically designed to automate Shapefile tasks. ShapefileGPT utilizes a multi-agent architecture, in which the planner agent is responsible for task decomposition and supervision, while the worker agent executes the tasks. We developed a specialized function library for handling Shapefiles and provided comprehensive API documentation, enabling the worker agent to operate Shapefiles efficiently through function calling. For evaluation, we developed a benchmark dataset based on authoritative textbooks, encompassing tasks in categories such as geometric operations and spatial queries. ShapefileGPT achieved a task success rate of 95.24%, outperforming the GPT series models. In comparison to traditional LLMs, ShapefileGPT effectively handles complex vector data analysis tasks, overcoming the limitations of traditional LLMs in spatial analysis. This breakthrough opens new pathways for advancing automation and intelligence in the GIS field, with significant potential in interdisciplinary data analysis and application contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models Engineer Too Many Simple Features For Tabular Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17787v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tabular machine learning problems often require time-consuming and labor-intensive feature engineering. Recent efforts have focused on using large language models (LLMs) to capitalize on their potential domain knowledge. At the same time, researchers have observed ethically concerning negative biases in other LLM-related use cases, such as text generation. These developments motivated us to investigate whether LLMs exhibit a bias that negatively impacts the performance of feature engineering. While not ethically concerning, such a bias could hinder practitioners from fully utilizing LLMs for automated data science. Therefore, we propose a method to detect potential biases by detecting anomalies in the frequency of operators (e.g., adding two features) suggested by LLMs when engineering new features. Our experiments evaluate the bias of four LLMs, two big frontier and two small open-source models, across 27 tabular datasets. Our results indicate that LLMs are biased toward simple operators, such as addition, and can fail to utilize more complex operators, such as grouping followed by aggregations. Furthermore, the bias can negatively impact the predictive performance when using LLM-generated features. Our results call for mitigating bias when using LLMs for feature engineering.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Locating Information in Large Language Models via Random Matrix Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17770v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become central to AI applications, gaining a deeper understanding of their inner workings is increasingly important. In this work, we analyze the weight matrices of pretrained transformer models -- specifically BERT and Llama -- using random matrix theory (RMT) as a zero-information hypothesis. While randomly initialized weights perfectly agree with RMT predictions, deviations emerge after training, allowing us to locate learned structures within the models. We identify layer-type specific behaviors that are consistent across all blocks and architectures considered. By pinpointing regions that deviate from RMT predictions, we highlight areas of feature learning and confirm this through comparisons with the activation covariance matrices of the corresponding layers. Our method provides a diagnostic tool for identifying relevant regions in transformer weights using only the trained matrices. Additionally, we address the ongoing debate regarding the significance of small singular values in the context of fine-tuning and alignment in LLMs. Our findings reveal that, after fine-tuning, small singular values play a crucial role in the models' capabilities, suggesting that removing them in an already aligned transformer can be detrimental, as it may compromise model alignment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 14 figures |

Recently, open-source LLVMs have curated high-quality visual instruction tuning datasets and utilized additional vision encoders or multiple computer vision models in order to narrow the performance gap with powerful closed-source LLVMs. These advancements are attributed to multifaceted information required for diverse capabilities, including fundamental image understanding, real-world knowledge about common-sense and non-object concepts (e.g., charts, diagrams, symbols, signs, and math problems), and step-by-step procedures for solving complex questions. Drawing from the multifaceted information, we present a new efficient LLVM, Mamba-based traversal of rationales (Meteor), which leverages multifaceted rationale to enhance understanding and answering capabilities. To embed lengthy rationales containing abundant information, we employ the Mamba architecture, capable of processing sequential data with linear time complexity. We introduce a new concept of traversal of rationale that facilitates efficient embedding of rationale. Subsequently, the backbone multimodal language model (MLM) is trained to generate answers with the aid of rationale. Through these steps, Meteor achieves significant improvements in vision language performances across multiple evaluation benchmarks requiring diverse capabilities, without scaling up the model size or employing additional vision encoders and computer vision models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available in https://github.com/ByungKwanLee/Meteor</p></details> |

Recent studies have attempted to enhance LLMs' performance by combining step-wise planning with external retrieval. While effective for advanced models like GPT-3.5, smaller LLMs face challenges in decomposing complex questions, necessitating supervised fine-tuning. Previous work has relied on manual annotation and knowledge distillation from teacher LLMs, which are time-consuming and not accurate enough. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for enhancing LLMs' planning capabilities by using planning data derived from knowledge graphs (KGs). LLMs fine-tuned with this data have improved planning capabilities, better equipping them to handle complex QA tasks that involve retrieval. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including our newly proposed benchmark, highlight the effectiveness of our framework and the benefits of KG-derived planning data.</p></details> | EMNLP2024 Findings |

While using LLMs as foundation models and applying semantic steering methods are widely practiced, we believe that efficient methods should be based on a thorough understanding of LLM behavior. To this end, we propose using eye movement measures to interpret LLM behavior across layers. We find that LLMs exhibit patterns similar to human gaze across layers and different layers function differently. Inspired by these findings, we introduce a heuristic steering layer selection and apply it to layer intervention methods via fine-tuning and inference. Using language toxification and detoxification as test beds, we demonstrate that our proposed CogSteer methods achieve better results in terms of toxicity scores while efficiently saving 97% of the computational resources and 60% of the training time. Our model-agnostic approach can be adopted into various LLMs, contributing to their interpretability and promoting trustworthiness for safe deployment.</p></details> |  |

Post-training pruning is a promising method that does not require resource-intensive iterative training and only needs a small amount of calibration data to assess the importance of parameters. Previous research has primarily focused on designing advanced pruning methods, while different calibration data's impact on pruning performance still lacks systematical exploration. We fill this blank and surprisingly observe that the effects of calibration data even value more than designing advanced pruning strategies, especially for high sparsity. Our preliminary exploration also discloses that using calibration data similar to the training data can yield better performance. As pre-training data is usually inaccessible for advanced LLMs, we further provide a self-generating calibration data synthesis strategy to construct feasible calibration data. We conduct experiments on the recent strong open-source LLMs (e.g., DCLM, and LLaMA-3), and the results show that the proposed method outperforms commonly used calibration data and can effectively enhance strong pruning methods (e.g., Wanda, OWL).</p></details> | under review |

Effectively addressing unhealthy node mitigation is therefore vital for sustaining cloud system performance. This paper introduces Deoxys, a causal inference engine tailored to recommending mitigation actions for unhealthy node in cloud systems to minimize virtual machine downtime and interruptions during unhealthy events. It employs double machine learning combined with causal forest to produce precise and reliable mitigation recommendations based solely on limited observational data collected from the historical unhealthy events. To enhance the causal inference model, Deoxys further incorporates a policy fallback mechanism based on model uncertainty and action overriding mechanisms to (i) improve the reliability of the system, and (ii) strike a good tradeoff between downtime reduction and resource utilization, thereby enhancing the overall system performance. After deploying Deoxys in a large-scale cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, our observations demonstrate that Deoxys significantly reduces average VM downtime by 53% compared to a legacy policy, while leading to 49.5% lower VM interruption rate. This substantial improvement enhances the reliability and stability of cloud platforms, resulting in a seamless customer experience.</p></details> |  |

Current methods, from handcrafted feature extraction to deep learning, have made progress but remain rigid, requiring manual design and large labeled datasets. To address these issues, we propose AutoRNet, a framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with evolutionary algorithms to generate heuristics for robust network design. We design network optimization strategies to provide domain-specific prompts for LLMs, utilizing domain knowledge to generate advanced heuristics. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive fitness function to balance convergence and diversity while maintaining degree distributions. AutoRNet is evaluated on sparse and dense scale-free networks, outperforming current methods by reducing the need for manual design and large datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, available state estimation schemes are not necessarily real-time feasible for certain large-scale systems. Therefore, we develop in this paper, a real-time feasible state-estimation scheme for a class of large-scale systems that approximates the steady state Kalman filter. In particular, we focus on systems where the state-vector is the result of discretizing the spatial domain, as typically seen in Partial Differential Equations. In such cases, the correlation between states in the state-vector often have an intuitive interpretation on the spatial domain, which can be exploited to obtain a significant reduction in computational complexity, while still providing accurate state estimates. We illustrate these strengths of our method through a hyperthermia cancer treatment case study. The results of the case study show significant improvements in the computation time, while simultaneously obtaining good state estimates, when compared to Ensemble Kalman filters and Kalman filters using reduced-order models.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, CDC 2022 conference</p></details> |

This is typically achieved by using labeled datasets of chosen/rejected pairs and employing optimization algorithms like direct preference optimization (DPO). Existing visual alignment methods, primarily designed for single-image scenarios, struggle to effectively handle the complexity of multi-image tasks due to the scarcity of diverse training data and the high cost of annotating chosen/rejected pairs. We present Multi-Image Augmented Direct Preference Optimization (MIA-DPO), a visual preference alignment approach that effectively handles multi-image inputs. MIA-DPO mitigates the scarcity of diverse multi-image training data by extending single-image data with unrelated images arranged in grid collages or pic-in-pic formats, significantly reducing the costs associated with multi-image data annotations. Our observation reveals that attention values of LVLMs vary considerably across different images. We use attention values to identify and filter out rejected responses the model may have mistakenly focused on. Our attention-aware selection for constructing the chosen/rejected pairs without relying on (i) human annotation, (ii) extra data, and (iii) external models or APIs. MIA-DPO is compatible with various architectures and outperforms existing methods on five multi-image benchmarks, achieving an average performance boost of 3.0% on LLaVA-v1.5 and 4.3% on the recent InternLM-XC2.5. Moreover, MIA-DPO has a minimal effect on the model's ability to understand single images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project URL: https://github.com/Liuziyu77/MIA-DPO</p></details> |

The remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and CodeLlama, on code-related tasks has prompted recent works to explore if LLMs can be used to detect vulnerabilities. In this paper, we perform a more comprehensive study by concurrently examining a higher number of datasets, languages and LLMs, and qualitatively evaluating performance across prompts and vulnerability classes while addressing the shortcomings of existing tools. Concretely, we evaluate the effectiveness of 16 pre-trained LLMs on 5,000 code samples from five diverse security datasets. These balanced datasets encompass both synthetic and real-world projects in Java and C/C++ and cover 25 distinct vulnerability classes. Overall, LLMs across all scales and families show modest effectiveness in detecting vulnerabilities, obtaining an average accuracy of 62.8% and F1 score of 0.71 across datasets. They are significantly better at detecting vulnerabilities only requiring intra-procedural analysis, such as OS Command Injection and NULL Pointer Dereference. Moreover, they report higher accuracies on these vulnerabilities than popular static analysis tools, such as CodeQL. We find that advanced prompting strategies that involve step-by-step analysis significantly improve performance of LLMs on real-world datasets in terms of F1 score (by upto 0.18 on average). Interestingly, we observe that LLMs show promising abilities at performing parts of the analysis correctly, such as identifying vulnerability-related specifications and leveraging natural language information to understand code behavior (e.g., to check if code is sanitized). We expect our insights to guide future work on LLM-augmented vulnerability detection systems.</p></details> |  |

However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental images to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs. Please find the dataset and codes at https://microsoft.github.io/visualization-of-thought</p></details> | <details><summary>38th ...</summary><p>38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

This study explores the application of LLMs in UAV control, focusing on the opportunities for integrating advanced natural language processing into autonomous aerial systems. By enabling UAVs to interpret and respond to natural language commands, LLMs simplify the UAV control and usage, making them accessible to a broader user base and facilitating more intuitive human-machine interactions. The paper discusses several key areas where LLMs can impact UAV technology, including autonomous decision-making, dynamic mission planning, enhanced situational awareness, and improved safety protocols. Through a comprehensive review of current developments and potential future directions, this study aims to highlight how LLMs can transform UAV operations, making them more adaptable, responsive, and efficient in complex environments. A template development framework for integrating LLMs in UAV control is also described. Proof of Concept results that integrate existing LLM models and popular robotic simulation platforms are demonstrated. The findings suggest that while there are substantial technical and ethical challenges to address, integrating LLMs into UAV control holds promising implications for advancing autonomous aerial systems.</p></details> |  |

While they deliver powerful performance, they also face a set of common optimization needs to meet specific requirements or standards, such as instruction following or avoiding the output of sensitive information from the real world. However, how to reuse the fine-tuning outcomes of one model to other models to reduce training costs remains a challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce Cross-model Control (CMC), a method that improves multiple LLMs in one-time training with a portable tiny language model. Specifically, we have observed that the logit shift before and after fine-tuning is remarkably similar across different models. Based on this insight, we incorporate a tiny language model with a minimal number of parameters. By training alongside a frozen template LLM, the tiny model gains the capability to alter the logits output by the LLMs. To make this tiny language model applicable to models with different vocabularies, we propose a novel token mapping strategy named PM-MinED. We have conducted extensive experiments on instruction tuning and unlearning tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of CMC.

While emerging benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate LLMs in various domains such as mathematics and computer science, they merely measure the accuracy in terms of the final prediction on multi-choice questions. However, it remains insufficient to verify the essential understanding of LLMs given a chosen choice. To fill this gap, we present CLR-Bench to comprehensively evaluate the LLMs in complex college-level reasoning. Specifically, (i) we prioritize 16 challenging college disciplines in computer science and artificial intelligence. The dataset contains 5 types of questions, while each question is associated with detailed explanations from experts. (ii) To quantify a fair evaluation of LLMs' reasoning ability, we formalize the criteria with two novel metrics. Q$\rightarrow$A is utilized to measure the performance of direct answer prediction, and Q$\rightarrow$AR effectively considers the joint ability to answer the question and provide rationale simultaneously. Extensive experiments are conducted with 40 LLMs over 1,018 discipline-specific questions. The results demonstrate the key insights that LLMs, even the best closed-source LLM, i.e., GPT-4 turbo, tend to `guess' the college-level answers.

Under this setting, open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) in a single image has been studied in many literature. However, open-vocabulary object tracking (OVT) from a video has been studied less, and one reason is the shortage of benchmarks. In this work, we have built a new large-scale benchmark for open-vocabulary multi-object tracking namely OVT-B. OVT-B contains 1,048 categories of objects and 1,973 videos with 637,608 bounding box annotations, which is much larger than the sole open-vocabulary tracking dataset, i.e., OVTAO-val dataset (200+ categories, 900+ videos). The proposed OVT-B can be used as a new benchmark to pave the way for OVT research. We also develop a simple yet effective baseline method for OVT. It integrates the motion features for object tracking, which is an important feature for MOT but is ignored in previous OVT methods.

While theoretical foundations are well-established, practical implementation guidelines remain scattered. This work bridges this gap by providing a comprehensive end-to-end framework for developing and deploying MLLMs in production environments. We make three distinctive contributions: First, we present an actionable pipeline from data pre-processing through deployment, integrating insights from academic research and industrial applications. Second, using Llama2 as a case study, we provide detailed optimization strategies for enhancing multilingual capabilities, including curriculum learning approaches for balancing high-resource and low-resource languages, tokenization strategies, and effective sampling methods. Third, we offer an interdisciplinary analysis that considers technical, linguistic, and cultural perspectives in MLLM development.

| **[Large Language Models Still Exhibit Bias in Long Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17519v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing fairness benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) primarily focus on simple tasks, such as multiple-choice questions, overlooking biases that may arise in more complex scenarios like long-text generation. To address this gap, we introduce the Long Text Fairness Test (LTF-TEST), a framework that evaluates biases in LLMs through essay-style prompts. LTF-TEST covers 14 topics and 10 demographic axes, including gender and race, resulting in 11,948 samples. By assessing both model responses and the reasoning behind them, LTF-TEST uncovers subtle biases that are difficult to detect in simple responses. In our evaluation of five recent LLMs, including GPT-4o and LLaMa3, we identify two key patterns of bias. First, these models frequently favor certain demographic groups in their responses. Second, they show excessive sensitivity toward traditionally disadvantaged groups, often providing overly protective responses while neglecting others. To mitigate these biases, we propose FT-REGARD, a finetuning approach that pairs biased prompts with neutral responses. FT-REGARD reduces gender bias by 34.6% and improves performance by 1.4 percentage points on the BBQ benchmark, offering a promising approach to addressing biases in long-text generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 page, 38 figures, Neurips (SoLaR Workshop)</p></details> |
| **[HCDN: A Change Detection Network for Construction Housekeeping Using Feature Fusion and Large Vision Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17513v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Workplace safety has received increasing attention as millions of workers worldwide suffer from work-related accidents. Despite poor housekeeping is a significant contributor to construction accidents, there remains a significant lack of technological research focused on improving housekeeping practices in construction sites. Recognizing and locating poor housekeeping in a dynamic construction site is an important task that can be improved through computer vision approaches. Despite advances in AI and computer vision, existing methods for detecting poor housekeeping conditions face many challenges, including limited explanations, lack of locating of poor housekeeping, and lack of annotated datasets. On the other hand, change detection which aims to detect the changed environmental conditions (e.g., changing from good to poor housekeeping) and 'where' the change has occurred (e.g., location of objects causing poor housekeeping), has not been explored to the problem of housekeeping management. To address these challenges, we propose the Housekeeping Change Detection Network (HCDN), an advanced change detection neural network that integrates a feature fusion module and a large vision model, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Additionally, we introduce the approach to establish a novel change detection dataset (named Housekeeping-CCD) focused on housekeeping in construction sites, along with a housekeeping segmentation dataset. Our contributions include significant performance improvements compared to existing methods, providing an effective tool for enhancing construction housekeeping and safety. To promote further development, we share our source code and trained models for global researchers: https://github.com/NUS-DBE/Housekeeping-CD.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAGLE: Strategic Weight Attribution for Effective and Modular Unlearning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17509v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The need for effective unlearning mechanisms in large language models (LLMs) is increasingly urgent, driven by the necessity to adhere to data regulations and foster ethical generative AI practices. Despite growing interest of LLM unlearning, much of the existing research has focused on varied unlearning method designs to boost effectiveness and efficiency. However, the inherent relationship between model weights and LLM unlearning has not been extensively examined. In this paper, we systematically explore how model weights interact with unlearning processes in LLMs and we design the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method, WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. By strategically guiding the LLM unlearning across different types of unlearning methods and tasks, WAGLE can erase the undesired content, while maintaining the performance of the original tasks. We refer to the weight attribution-guided LLM unlearning method as WAGLE, which unveils the interconnections between 'influence' of weights and 'influence' of data to forget and retain in LLM generation. Our extensive experiments show that WAGLE boosts unlearning performance across a range of LLM unlearning methods such as gradient difference and (negative) preference optimization, applications such as fictitious unlearning, malicious use prevention, and copyrighted information removal, and models including Zephyr-7b-beta and Llama2-7b. To the best of our knowledge, our work offers the first principled method for attributing and pinpointing the influential weights in enhancing LLM unlearning. It stands in contrast to previous methods that lack weight attribution and simpler weight attribution techniques.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, MLLMs encounter the challenge of adapting to users' evolving knowledge and demands. Therefore, how to retain existing skills while acquiring new knowledge needs to be investigated. In this paper, we present a comprehensive benchmark, namely Continual Instruction tuNing (CoIN), to assess existing MLLMs in the sequential instruction tuning paradigm. CoIN comprises 10 commonly used datasets spanning 8 task categories, ensuring a diverse range of instructions and tasks. Besides, the trained model is evaluated from two aspects: Instruction Following and General Knowledge, which assess the alignment with human intention and knowledge preserved for reasoning, respectively. Experiments on CoIN demonstrate that current powerful MLLMs still suffer catastrophic forgetting, and the failure in intention alignment assumes the main responsibility, instead of the knowledge forgetting. To this end, we introduce MoELoRA to MLLMs which is effective to retain the previous instruction alignment. Experimental results consistently illustrate the forgetting decreased from this method on CoIN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware Assistant Selection for Improved Inference Acceleration with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08470v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their widespread adoption, large language models (LLMs) remain prohibitive to use under resource constraints, with their ever growing sizes only increasing the barrier for use. One noted issue is the high latency associated with auto-regressive generation, rendering large LLMs use dependent on advanced computing infrastructure. Assisted decoding, where a smaller draft model guides a larger target model's generation, has helped alleviate this, but remains dependent on alignment between the two models. Thus if the draft model is insufficiently capable on some domain relative to the target model, performance can degrade. Alternatively, one can leverage multiple draft models to better cover the expertise of the target, but when multiple black-box draft models are available, selecting an assistant without details about its construction can be difficult. To better understand this decision making problem, we observe it as a contextual bandit, where a policy must choose a draft model based on a context. We show that even without prior knowledge of the draft models, creating an offline dataset from only outputs of independent draft/target models and training a policy over the alignment of these outputs can accelerate performance on multiple domains provided the candidates are effective. Further results show this to hold on various settings with multiple assisted decoding candidates, highlighting its flexibility and the advantageous role that such decision making can play.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP); 14 pages (9 pages main content + references + appendix)</p></details> |
| **[On Catastrophic Inheritance of Large Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01909v2)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models (LFMs) are claiming incredible performances. Yet great concerns have been raised about their mythic and uninterpreted potentials not only in machine learning, but also in various other disciplines. In this position paper, we propose to identify a neglected issue deeply rooted in LFMs: Catastrophic Inheritance, describing the weaknesses and limitations inherited from biased large-scale pre-training data to behaviors of LFMs on the downstream tasks, including samples that are corrupted, long-tailed, noisy, out-of-distributed, to name a few. Such inheritance can potentially cause catastrophes to downstream applications, such as bias, lack of generalization, deteriorated performance, security vulnerability, privacy leakage, and value misalignment. We discuss the challenges behind this issue and propose UIM, a framework to Understand the catastrophic inheritance of LFMs from both pre-training and downstream adaptation, Interpret the implications of catastrophic inheritance on downstream tasks, and how to Mitigate it. UIM aims to unite both the machine learning and social sciences communities for more responsible and promising AI development and deployment.</p></details> | Accepted by DMLR |

Earlier SpeechLMs focused on single-turn speech-based question answering (QA), where user input comprised a speech context and a text question. More recent studies have extended this to multi-turn conversations, though they often require complex, multi-stage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with diverse data. Another critical challenge with SpeechLMs is catastrophic forgetting-where models optimized for speech tasks suffer significant degradation in text-only performance. To mitigate these issues, we propose a novel single-stage joint speech-text SFT approach on the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) of the LLM backbone. Our joint SFT combines text-only SFT data with three types of speech-related data: speech recognition and translation, speech-based QA, and mixed-modal SFT. Compared to previous SpeechLMs with 7B or 13B parameters, our 3B model demonstrates superior performance across various speech benchmarks while preserving the original capabilities on text-only tasks. Furthermore, our model shows emergent abilities of effectively handling previously unseen prompts and tasks, including multi-turn, mixed-modal inputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[In Context Learning and Reasoning for Symbolic Regression with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17448v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transformer-based machine learning models that have shown remarkable performance in tasks for which they were not explicitly trained. Here, we explore the potential of LLMs to perform symbolic regression -- a machine-learning method for finding simple and accurate equations from datasets. We prompt GPT-4 to suggest expressions from data, which are then optimized and evaluated using external Python tools. These results are fed back to GPT-4, which proposes improved expressions while optimizing for complexity and loss. Using chain-of-thought prompting, we instruct GPT-4 to analyze the data, prior expressions, and the scientific context (expressed in natural language) for each problem before generating new expressions. We evaluated the workflow in rediscovery of five well-known scientific equations from experimental data, and on an additional dataset without a known equation. GPT-4 successfully rediscovered all five equations, and in general, performed better when prompted to use a scratchpad and consider scientific context. We also demonstrate how strategic prompting improves the model's performance and how the natural language interface simplifies integrating theory with data. Although this approach does not outperform established SR programs where target equations are more complex, LLMs can nonetheless iterate toward improved solutions while following instructions and incorporating scientific context in natural language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Reason? A Characterization via 3-SAT](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07215v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been touted as AI models possessing advanced reasoning abilities. However, recent works have shown that LLMs often bypass true reasoning using shortcuts, sparking skepticism. To study the reasoning capabilities in a principled fashion, we adopt a computational theory perspective and propose an experimental protocol centered on 3-SAT -- the prototypical NP-complete problem lying at the core of logical reasoning and constraint satisfaction tasks. Specifically, we examine the phase transitions in random 3-SAT and characterize the reasoning abilities of LLMs by varying the inherent hardness of the problem instances. Our experimental evidence shows that LLMs are incapable of performing true reasoning, as required for solving 3-SAT problems. Moreover, we observe significant performance variation based on the inherent hardness of the problems -- performing poorly on harder instances and vice versa. Importantly, we show that integrating external reasoners can considerably enhance LLM performance. By following a principled experimental protocol, our study draws concrete conclusions and moves beyond the anecdotal evidence often found in LLM reasoning research.</p></details> |  |

System logs generated by these devices serve as valuable repositories of historical trends and past failures. The use of machine learning techniques for failure prediction has become commonplace, enabling the extraction of insights from past data to anticipate future behavior patterns. Recently, large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in tasks including summarization, reasoning, and event prediction. Therefore, in this paper, we endeavor to investigate the potential of large language models in predicting system failures, leveraging insights learned from past failure behavior to inform reasoning and decision-making processes effectively. Our approach involves leveraging data from the Intel Computing Improvement Program (ICIP) system crash logs to identify significant events and develop CrashEventLLM. This model, built upon a large language model framework, serves as our foundation for crash event prediction. Specifically, our model utilizes historical data to forecast future crash events, informed by expert annotations. Additionally, it goes beyond mere prediction, offering insights into potential causes for each crash event. This work provides the preliminary insights into prompt-based large language models for the log-based event prediction task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICITCOM'24.

We present NutriBench, the first publicly available natural language meal description nutrition benchmark. NutriBench consists of 11,857 meal descriptions generated from real-world global dietary intake data. The data is human-verified and annotated with macro-nutrient labels, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and calories. We conduct an extensive evaluation of NutriBench on the task of carbohydrate estimation, testing twelve leading Large Language Models (LLMs), including GPT-4o, Llama3.1, Qwen2, Gemma2, and OpenBioLLM models, using standard, Chain-of-Thought and Retrieval-Augmented Generation strategies. Additionally, we present a study involving professional nutritionists, finding that LLMs can provide more accurate and faster estimates. Finally, we perform a real-world risk assessment by simulating the effect of carbohydrate predictions on the blood glucose levels of individuals with diabetes. Our work highlights the opportunities and challenges of using LLMs for nutrition estimation, demonstrating their potential to aid professionals and laypersons and improve health outcomes.

Most methods rely on spotting them by analysing misclassified samples, in a semi-automated human-computer validation. In contrast, we propose ConceptDrift, a method which analyzes the weights of a linear probe, learned on top a foundational model. We capitalize on the weight update trajectory, which starts from the embedding of the textual representation of the class, and proceeds to drift towards embeddings that disclose hidden biases. Different from prior work, with this approach we can pin-point unwanted correlations from a dataset, providing more than just possible explanations for the wrong predictions. We empirically prove the efficacy of our method, by significantly improving zero-shot performance with biased-augmented prompting. Our method is not bounded to a single modality, and we experiment in this work with both image (Waterbirds, CelebA, Nico++) and text datasets (CivilComments).</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the Performance of Foundation Models via Agreement-on-the-Line](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01542v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the out-of-distribution performance in regimes where labels are scarce is critical to safely deploy foundation models. Recently, it was shown that ensembles of neural networks observe the phenomena "agreement-on-the-line", which can be leveraged to reliably predict OOD performance without labels. However, in contrast to classical neural networks that are trained on in-distribution data from scratch for numerous epochs, foundation models undergo minimal finetuning from heavily pretrained weights, which may reduce the ensemble diversity needed to observe agreement-on-the-line. In our work, we demonstrate that when lightly finetuning multiple runs from a single foundation model, the choice of randomness during training (linear head initialization, data ordering, and data subsetting) can lead to drastically different levels of agreement-on-the-line in the resulting ensemble. Surprisingly, only random head initialization is able to reliably induce agreement-on-the-line in finetuned foundation models across vision and language benchmarks. Second, we demonstrate that ensembles of multiple foundation models pretrained on different datasets but finetuned on the same task can also show agreement-on-the-line. In total, by careful construction of a diverse ensemble, we can utilize agreement-on-the-line-based methods to predict the OOD performance of foundation models with high precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[ONCOPILOT: A Promptable CT Foundation Model For Solid Tumor Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07908v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks. To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights. This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedBaF: Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18352v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are now a major focus of leading technology organizations due to their ability to generalize across diverse tasks. Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4\% in IID and up to 15.8\% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2\%.</p></details> |  |

Techniques leveraging in-context learning (ICL) have shown promise here, allowing for dynamic adaptation to unseen data. ICL can provide predictions for entirely new datasets without further training or hyperparameter tuning, therefore providing very fast inference when encountering a novel task. However, scaling ICL for tabular data remains an issue: approaches based on large language models cannot efficiently process numeric tables, and tabular-specific techniques have not been able to effectively harness the power of real data to improve performance and generalization. We are able to overcome these challenges by training tabular-specific ICL-based architectures on real data with self-supervised learning and retrieval, combining the best of both worlds. Our resulting model -- the Tabular Discriminative Pre-trained Transformer (TabDPT) -- achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CC18 (classification) and CTR23 (regression) benchmarks with no task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating the adapatability and speed of ICL once the model is pre-trained. TabDPT also demonstrates strong scaling as both model size and amount of available data increase, pointing towards future improvements simply through the curation of larger tabular pre-training datasets and training larger models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minim...</summary><p>Minimal TabDPT interface to provide predictions on new datasets available at the following link: https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT</p></details> |

Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/vila-u.

Moreover, robot policies that follow natural language instructions are typically trained on either templated language or expensive human-labeled instructions, hindering their scalability. To this end, we introduce NILS: Natural language Instruction Labeling for Scalability. NILS automatically labels uncurated, long-horizon robot data at scale in a zero-shot manner without any human intervention. NILS combines pretrained vision-language foundation models in order to detect objects in a scene, detect object-centric changes, segment tasks from large datasets of unlabelled interaction data and ultimately label behavior datasets. Evaluations on BridgeV2, Fractal, and a kitchen play dataset show that NILS can autonomously annotate diverse robot demonstrations of unlabeled and unstructured datasets while alleviating several shortcomings of crowdsourced human annotations, such as low data quality and diversity. We use NILS to label over 115k trajectories obtained from over 430 hours of robot data.

Accurate modeling of real-world chemical reactors through first-principles is often challenging, and the process of rebuilding and retraining models for each new chemical process is inefficient. This raises a critical question: can we develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., a foundation model) that can rapidly adapt to any new chemical process in a reactor? To address this, we propose a foundation model for chemical reactor modeling that employs a meta-learning approach, followed by physics-informed fine-tuning on new tasks with only a few data samples. Our model is designed to generalize across three classic reactor types: continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, and plug flow reactors. Compared to conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning, our approach demonstrates superior performance in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, it shows rapid adaptation to unseen reactions with varying integer orders across different reactor set-ups, requiring minimal data for fine-tuning.

| **[Securing Federated Learning Against Novel and Classic Backdoor Threats During Foundation Model Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17573v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving privacy. Recently, integrating Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has boosted performance but also introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism. Attackers can exploit the FM's capabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data generated by FMs used for model fusion, subsequently infecting all client models through knowledge sharing without involvement in the long-lasting FL process. These novel attacks render existing FL backdoor defenses ineffective, as they primarily detect anomalies among client updates, which may appear uniformly malicious under this attack. Our work proposes a novel data-free defense strategy by constraining abnormal activations in the hidden feature space during model aggregation on the server. The activation constraints, optimized using synthetic data alongside FL training, mitigate the attack while barely affecting model performance, as the parameters remain untouched. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against both novel and classic backdoor attacks, outperforming existing defenses while maintaining model performance.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical issue remains: the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of assessing the quality and scientific validity of model outputs. To address this issue, we develop ClimaGen (Climate QA Generator), an automated algorithmic framework that generates question-answer pairs from graduate textbooks with climate scientists in the loop. As a result, we present ClimaQA-Gold, an expert-annotated benchmark dataset alongside ClimaQA-Silver, a large-scale, comprehensive synthetic QA dataset for climate science. Finally, we develop evaluation strategies and compare different Large Language Models (LLMs) on our benchmarks. Our results offer novel insights into various approaches used to enhance climate foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Power of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16327v5)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With infinitely many high-quality data points, infinite computational power, an infinitely large foundation model with a perfect training algorithm and guaranteed zero generalization error on the pretext task, can the model be used for everything? This question cannot be answered by the existing theory of representation, optimization or generalization, because the issues they mainly investigate are assumed to be nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that category theory provides powerful machinery to answer this question. We have proved three results. The first one limits the power of prompt-based learning, saying that the model can solve a downstream task with prompts if and only if the task is representable. The second one says fine tuning does not have this limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required power (up to symmetry) can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category defined by pretext task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result can be seen as a new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation model can generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using the structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way, we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning, which might be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML'...</summary><p>ICML'23.

Meanwhile, recent breakthroughs in large Foundation Models (FMs) have expanded AI's potential across many domains due to their exceptional generalizability and zero-shot transfer capabilities. However, their success has largely been confined to natural data like images and video, with degraded performance and even failures for RS data of various non-optical modalities. This has inspired growing interest in developing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to address the complex demands of Earth Observation (EO) tasks, spanning the surface, atmosphere, and oceans. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of RSFMs. It begins with an outline of their motivation and background, followed by an introduction of their foundational concepts. It then categorizes and reviews existing RSFM studies including their datasets and technical contributions across Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), Visual-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and beyond. In addition, we benchmark these models against publicly available datasets, discuss existing challenges, and propose future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> |  |

A Study Based on Moral Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11100v2)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have taken centre stage in debates on Artificial Intelligence. Yet there remains a gap in how to assess LLMs' conformity to important human values. In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 (Gemini Pro and LLAMA 2 did not generate valid results) are moral hypocrites. We employ two research instruments based on the Moral Foundations Theory: (i) the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), which investigates which values are considered morally relevant in abstract moral judgements; and (ii) the Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs), which evaluate moral cognition in concrete scenarios related to each moral foundation. We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy. We found that both models displayed reasonable consistency within each instrument compared to humans, but they displayed contradictory and hypocritical behaviour when we compared the abstract values present in the MFQ to the evaluation of concrete moral violations of the MFV.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version available at: https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AIES/article/view/31704 13 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Promoting cross-modal representations to improve multimodal foundation models for physiological signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16424v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, involving several physiological signals. As sensors for these signals become more common, improving machine learning methods for multimodal healthcare data is crucial. Pretraining foundation models is a promising avenue for success. However, methods for developing foundation models in healthcare are still in early exploration and it is unclear which pretraining strategies are most effective given the diversity of physiological signals. This is partly due to challenges in multimodal health data: obtaining data across many patients is difficult and costly, there is a lot of inter-subject variability, and modalities are often heterogeneously informative across downstream tasks. Here, we explore these challenges in the PhysioNet 2018 dataset. We use a masked autoencoding objective to pretrain a multimodal model. We show that the model learns representations that can be linearly probed for a diverse set of downstream tasks. We hypothesize that cross-modal reconstruction objectives are important for successful multimodal training, as they encourage the model to integrate information across modalities. We demonstrate that modality dropout in the input space improves performance across downstream tasks. We also find that late-fusion models pretrained with contrastive learning objectives are less effective across multiple tasks. Finally, we analyze the model's representations, showing that attention weights become more cross-modal and temporally aligned with our pretraining strategy. The learned embeddings also become more distributed in terms of the modalities encoded by each unit. Overall, our work demonstrates the utility of multimodal foundation models with health data, even across diverse physiological data sources. We further argue that explicit methods for inducing cross-modality may enhance multimodal pretraining strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 AIM-FM Workshop</p></details> |

However, they often struggle to adapt to specific tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to learn through interaction and feedback, offers a compelling solution. Integrating RL with FMs enables these models to achieve desired outcomes and excel at particular tasks. Additionally, RL can be enhanced by leveraging the reasoning and generalization capabilities of FMs. This synergy is revolutionizing various fields, including robotics. FMs, rich in knowledge and generalization, provide robots with valuable information, while RL facilitates learning and adaptation through real-world interactions. This survey paper comprehensively explores this exciting intersection, examining how these paradigms can be integrated to advance robotic intelligence. We analyze the use of foundation models as action planners, the development of robotics-specific foundation models, and the mutual benefits of combining FMs with RL. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of integration approaches, including large language models, vision-language models, diffusion models, and transformer-based RL models. We also explore how RL can utilize world representations learned from FMs to enhance robotic task execution. Our survey aims to synthesize current research and highlight key challenges in robotic reasoning and control, particularly in the context of integrating FMs and RL--two rapidly evolving technologies. By doing so, we seek to spark future research and emphasize critical areas that require further investigation to enhance robotics. We provide an updated collection of papers based on our taxonomy, accessible on our open-source project website at: https://github.com/clmoro/Robotics-RL-FMs-Integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication to the Special Issue on Foundation Models and Neural-Symbolic AI for Robotics in The International Journal of Robotics Research (IJRR)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Pathology Foundation Models: Adaptation Strategies and Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16038v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In computational pathology, several foundation models have recently emerged and demonstrated enhanced learning capability for analyzing pathology images. However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark four pathology-specific foundation models across 14 datasets and two scenarios-consistency assessment and flexibility assessment-addressing diverse adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the same downstream task. In the flexibility assessment scenario under data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of pathology image analysis.

However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI. As MIL frameworks rely on patch-level feature aggregation, this work aims to compare the performance of various feature extractors developed under different pretraining strategies for cancer subtyping on WSI under a MIL framework. Results demonstrate the ability of foundation models to surpass ImageNet-pretrained models for the prediction of six skin cancer subtypes</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted for oral presentation at Decision Science Allieance -INternational Summer Conference (DSA-ISC) 2024 held on Valencia, Spain</p></details> |
| **[DARES: Depth Anything in Robotic Endoscopic Surgery with Self-supervised Vector-LoRA of the Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17433v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) relies on accurate depth estimation for 3D reconstruction and visualization. While foundation models like Depth Anything Models (DAM) show promise, directly applying them to surgery often yields suboptimal results. Fully fine-tuning on limited surgical data can cause overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, compromising model robustness and generalization. Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses some adaptation issues, its uniform parameter distribution neglects the inherent feature hierarchy, where earlier layers, learning more general features, require more parameters than later ones. To tackle this issue, we introduce Depth Anything in Robotic Endoscopic Surgery (DARES), a novel approach that employs a new adaptation technique, Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (Vector-LoRA) on the DAM V2 to perform self-supervised monocular depth estimation in RAS scenes. To enhance learning efficiency, we introduce Vector-LoRA by integrating more parameters in earlier layers and gradually decreasing parameters in later layers. We also design a reprojection loss based on the multi-scale SSIM error to enhance depth perception by better tailoring the foundation model to the specific requirements of the surgical environment. The proposed method is validated on the SCARED dataset and demonstrates superior performance over recent state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation techniques, achieving an improvement of 13.3% in the absolute relative error metric. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/mobarakol/DARES.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[An Electrocardiogram Foundation Model Built on over 10 Million Recordings with External Evaluation across Multiple Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04133v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in ECG analysis and cardiovascular disease assessment. Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io. Our code is available at https://github.com/bdsp-core/ECGFounder</p></details> | working in progress |

SeisLM is pretrained on a large collection of open-source seismic datasets using a self-supervised contrastive loss, akin to BERT in language modeling. This approach allows the model to learn general seismic waveform patterns from unlabeled data without being tied to specific downstream tasks. When fine-tuned, SeisLM excels in seismological tasks like event detection, phase-picking, onset time regression, and foreshock-aftershock classification.

| **[FoundTS: Comprehensive and Unified Benchmarking of Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11802v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Forecasting (TSF) is key functionality in numerous fields, including in finance, weather services, and energy management. While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |

However, it is difficult to train a 3D foundation network directly due to the limited dataset and it remains under explored whether existing foundation models can be lifted to 3D space seamlessly. In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist training-free model by 14.1$\%$, 12.3$\%$, and 12.6$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various foundation models and even surpasses the specialist training-based methods by 3.4$\%$-5.4$\%$ mAP across various datasets, serving as an effective generalist model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Term Memory: The Foundation of AI Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15665v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and planning, achieving human-level performance in various tasks. Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |

While pruning is a promising technique to reduce model size and accelerate the inference, the traditional pruning techniques can hardly be applied for LLMs as they need to finetune the model on the full dataset with multiple epochs consuming massive data and hardware resources. To deal with this problem, post-training pruning methods are proposed to prune LLMs in one-shot without retraining. However, their accuracy after pruning may suffer from certain performance degradation due to the lack of retraining with massive data. To address this issue, in this paper, we first formulate the post-training problem for layer-wise LLM compression to simultaneously prune multiple weights in LLMs. Next, we provide an optimal solution for this problem and design our post-training pruning algorithm for both unstructured and semi-structured sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in comparison to SOTA baselines across various LLM families including transformer-based LLMs and Mamba-based LLMs. Code link: https://github.com/piuzha/APT</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 findings</p></details> |

Previous investigations in medical images have often been constrained to specific anatomical regions, particular applications, and limited datasets, resulting in isolated diffusion models. This paper introduces a diffusion-based foundation model to address a diverse range of medical image tasks, namely MedDiff-FM. MedDiff-FM leverages 3D CT images from multiple publicly available datasets, covering anatomical regions from head to abdomen, to pre-train a diffusion foundation model, and explores the capabilities of the diffusion foundation model across a variety of application scenarios. The diffusion foundation model handles multi-level image processing both at the image-level and patch-level, and utilizes position embedding to establish multi-level spatial relationships as well as anatomical structures and region classes to control certain anatomical regions. MedDiff-FM manages several downstream tasks seamlessly, including image denoising, anomaly detection, and image synthesis. MedDiff-FM is also capable of performing lesion generation and lesion inpainting by rapidly fine-tuning the diffusion foundation model using ControlNet with task-specific conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MedDiff-FM in addressing diverse downstream medical image tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality. We further deploy the FoMo on the JiuTian optimization platform of China Mobile, where we use the predicted mobile data to formulate network planning and optimization applications, including BS deployment, resource block scheduling, and BS sleep control.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

Current deep learning models, while effective at specific tasks such as diagnosing skin cancer from dermoscopic images, fall short in addressing the complex, multimodal demands of clinical practice. Here, we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on a dataset of over 2 million real-world images of skin diseases, sourced from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse datasets covering a range of clinical tasks, including skin cancer screening, phenotype assessment and risk stratification, diagnosis of neoplastic and inflammatory skin diseases, skin lesion segmentation, change monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models even when using only 5-10% of labeled data. PanDerm's clinical utility was demonstrated through reader studies in real-world clinical settings across multiple imaging modalities. It outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection accuracy and enhanced clinicians' multiclass skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% in a collaborative human-AI setting. Additionally, PanDerm demonstrated robust performance across diverse demographic factors, including different body locations, age groups, genders, and skin tones. The strong results in benchmark evaluations and real-world clinical scenarios suggest that PanDerm could enhance the management of skin diseases and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of AI support in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages; Technical report</p></details> |

However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 600 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> |  |

However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</p></details> | under review |

The overwhelming focus on these hypothetical and narrow themes has occluded a much-needed conversation regarding present uses of AI for military systems, specifically ISTAR: intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. These are the uses most grounded in actual deployments of AI that pose life-or-death stakes for civilians, where misuses and failures pose geopolitical consequences and military escalations. This is particularly underscored by novel proliferation risks specific to the widespread availability of commercial models and the lack of effective approaches that reliably prevent them from contributing to ISTAR capabilities. In this paper, we outline the significant national security concerns emanating from current and envisioned uses of commercial foundation models outside of CBRN contexts, and critique the narrowing of the policy debate that has resulted from a CBRN focus (e.g. compute thresholds, model weight release). We demonstrate that the inability to prevent personally identifiable information from contributing to ISTAR capabilities within commercial foundation models may lead to the use and proliferation of military AI technologies by adversaries. We also show how the usage of foundation models within military settings inherently expands the attack vectors of military systems and the defense infrastructures they interface with. We conclude that in order to secure military systems and limit the proliferation of AI armaments, it may be necessary to insulate military AI systems and personal data from commercial foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swiss Army Knife: Synergizing Biases in Knowledge from Vision Foundation Models for Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14633v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance on numerous downstream tasks. However, due to their inherent representation biases originating from different training paradigms, VFMs exhibit advantages and disadvantages across distinct vision tasks. Although amalgamating the strengths of multiple VFMs for downstream tasks is an intuitive strategy, effectively exploiting these biases remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and versatile "Swiss Army Knife" (SAK) solution, which adaptively distills knowledge from a committee of VFMs to enhance multi-task learning. Unlike existing methods that use a single backbone for knowledge transfer, our approach preserves the unique representation bias of each teacher by collaborating the lightweight Teacher-Specific Adapter Path modules with the Teacher-Agnostic Stem. Through dynamic selection and combination of representations with Mixture-of-Representations Routers, our SAK is capable of synergizing the complementary strengths of multiple VFMs. Extensive experiments show that our SAK remarkably outperforms prior state of the arts in multi-task learning by 10% on the NYUD-v2 benchmark, while also providing a flexible and robust framework that can readily accommodate more advanced model designs.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods that convert CF images to FFA are confined to static image generation, missing the dynamic lesional changes. We introduce Fundus2Video, an autoregressive generative adversarial network (GAN) model that generates dynamic FFA videos from single CF images. Fundus2Video excels in video generation, achieving an FVD of 1497.12 and a PSNR of 11.77. Clinical experts have validated the fidelity of the generated videos. Additionally, the model's generator demonstrates remarkable downstream transferability across ten external public datasets, including blood vessel segmentation, retinal disease diagnosis, systemic disease prediction, and multimodal retrieval, showcasing impressive zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. These findings position Fundus2Video as a powerful, non-invasive alternative to FFA exams and a versatile retinal generative foundation model that captures both static and temporal retinal features, enabling the representation of complex inter-modality relationships.</p></details> |  |

| **[X-Fi: A Modality-Invariant Foundation Model for Multimodal Human Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10167v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.</p></details> |  |

However, compared to 2D medical images, 3D medical images, such as CT scans, face challenges related to limited training data and high dimension, which severely restrict the progress of 3D medical vision-language models. To address these issues, we collect a large amount of unlabeled 3D CT data and utilize self-supervised learning to construct a 3D visual foundation model for extracting 3D visual features. Then, we apply 3D spatial convolutions to aggregate and project high-level image features, reducing computational complexity while preserving spatial information. We also construct two instruction-tuning datasets based on BIMCV-R and CT-RATE to fine-tune the 3D vision-language model. Our model demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods in report generation, visual question answering, and disease diagnosis. Code and data will be made publicly available soon.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that rely on rule-based systems or directly apply off-the-shelf large language models, BlockFound introduces a series of customized designs to model the unique data structure of blockchain transactions. First, a blockchain transaction is multi-modal, containing blockchain-specific tokens, texts, and numbers. We design a modularized tokenizer to handle these multi-modal inputs, balancing the information across different modalities. Second, we design a customized mask language learning mechanism for pretraining with RoPE embedding and FlashAttention for handling longer sequences. After training the foundation model, we further design a novel detection method for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluations on Ethereum and Solana transactions demonstrate BlockFound's exceptional capability in anomaly detection while maintaining a low false positive rate. Remarkably, BlockFound is the only method that successfully detects anomalous transactions on Solana with high accuracy, whereas all other approaches achieved very low or zero detection recall scores. This work not only provides new foundation models for blockchain but also sets a new benchmark for applying LLMs in blockchain data.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning has shown promise in exploring these relationships using various data types. However, transcriptomics, which provides detailed insights into cellular states, is still underused due to its high noise levels and limited data availability. Recent advancements in transcriptomics sequencing provide new opportunities to uncover valuable insights, especially with the rise of many new foundation models for transcriptomics, yet no benchmark has been made to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of these rising models for perturbation analysis. This article presents a novel biologically motivated evaluation framework and a hierarchy of perturbation analysis tasks for comparing the performance of pretrained foundation models to each other and to more classical techniques of learning from transcriptomics data. We compile diverse public datasets from different sequencing techniques and cell lines to assess models performance. Our approach identifies scVI and PCA to be far better suited models for understanding biological perturbations in comparison to existing foundation models, especially in their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2024 AIDrugX Workshop</p></details> |

The diverse nature of echo images, including variations in probe types, manufacturers, and pathologies, poses challenges for developing artificial intelligent models that can generalize across different clinical practice. We introduce EchoApex, the first general-purpose vision foundation model echocardiography with applications on a variety of clinical practice. Leveraging self-supervised learning, EchoApex is pretrained on over 20 million echo images from 11 clinical centres. By incorporating task-specific decoders and adapter modules, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoApex on 4 different kind of clinical applications with 28 sub-tasks, including view classification, interactive structure segmentation, left ventricle hypertrophy detection and automated ejection fraction estimation from view sequences. Compared to state-of-the-art task-specific models, EchoApex attains improved performance with a unified image encoding architecture, demonstrating the benefits of model pretraining at scale with in-domain data. Furthermore, EchoApex illustrates the potential for developing a general-purpose vision foundation model tailored specifically for echocardiography, capable of addressing a diverse range of clinical applications with high efficiency and efficacy.</p></details> |  |

The resulting continuous and longitudinal measurements from everyday life generate large volumes of data; however, making sense of these observations for scientific and actionable insights is non-trivial. Inspired by the empirical success of generative modeling, where large neural networks learn powerful representations from vast amounts of text, image, video, or audio data, we investigate the scaling properties of sensor foundation models across compute, data, and model size. Using a dataset of up to 40 million hours of in-situ heart rate, heart rate variability, electrodermal activity, accelerometer, skin temperature, and altimeter per-minute data from over 165,000 people, we create LSM, a multimodal foundation model built on the largest wearable-signals dataset with the most extensive range of sensor modalities to date. Our results establish the scaling laws of LSM for tasks such as imputation, interpolation and extrapolation, both across time and sensor modalities. Moreover, we highlight how LSM enables sample-efficient downstream learning for tasks like exercise and activity recognition.</p></details> |  |

This issue arises as contrastive losses unintentionally dissociate features of unmatched points and pixels that share semantic labels, compromising the integrity of learned representations. To overcome this, we harness Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), which have revolutionized the acquisition of pixel-level semantics, to enhance 3D representation learning. Specifically, we utilize off-the-shelf VFMs to generate semantic labels for weakly-supervised pixel-to-point contrastive distillation. Additionally, we employ von Mises-Fisher distributions to structure the feature space, ensuring semantic embeddings within the same class remain consistent across varying inputs. Furthermore, we adapt sampling probabilities of points to address imbalances in spatial distribution and category frequency, promoting comprehensive and balanced learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach mitigates the challenges posed by traditional methods and consistently surpasses existing image-to-LiDAR contrastive distillation methods in downstream tasks.

| **[Representation Learning of Structured Data for Medical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13351v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across various domains, including healthcare. However, their ability to effectively represent structured non-textual data, such as the alphanumeric medical codes used in records like ICD-10 or SNOMED-CT, is limited and has been particularly exposed in recent research. This paper examines the challenges LLMs face in processing medical codes due to the shortcomings of current tokenization methods. As a result, we introduce the UniStruct architecture to design a multimodal medical foundation model of unstructured text and structured data, which addresses these challenges by adapting subword tokenization techniques specifically for the structured medical codes. Our approach is validated through model pre-training on both an extensive internal medical database and a public repository of structured medical records. Trained on over 1 billion tokens on the internal medical database, the proposed model achieves up to a 23% improvement in evaluation metrics, with around 2% gain attributed to our proposed tokenization. Additionally, when evaluated on the EHRSHOT public benchmark with a 1/1000 fraction of the pre-training data, the UniStruct model improves performance on over 42% of the downstream tasks. Our approach not only enhances the representation and generalization capabilities of patient-centric models but also bridges a critical gap in representation learning models' ability to handle complex structured medical data, alongside unstructured text.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Workshop on Unifying Representations in Neural Models (UniReps 2024)</p></details> |

HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) computations in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define nearest-neighbor convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFMs training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Using over 154 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two state-of-the-art United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 Graphic Compute Dies (GCDs) on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Each HPO trial was ranked based on both accuracy and energy consumption. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures (selected with judicious balance between accuracy and energy consumption) continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contributions establish core capabilities for rapidly developing, training, and deploying further GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</p></details> | 20 pages, 25 figures |

However, their internal representations and learned concepts are still not well understood. In this study, we investigate the structure and redundancy of representations across various TSFMs, examining the self-similarity of model layers within and across different model sizes. This analysis reveals block-like redundancy in the representations, which can be utilized for informed pruning to improve inference speed and efficiency. Additionally, we explore the concepts learned by these models - such as periodicity and trends - and how these can be manipulated through latent space steering to influence model behavior. Our experiments show that steering interventions can introduce new features, e.g., adding periodicity or trends to signals that initially lacked them. These findings underscore the value of representational analysis for optimizing models and demonstrate how conceptual steering offers new possibilities for more controlled and efficient time series analysis with TSFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Knowledge guided Multimodal Foundation Model for Spatio-Temporal Remote Sensing Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19660v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been an increased interest in foundation models for geoscience due to the vast amount of Earth observing satellite imagery. Existing remote sensing foundation models make use of the various sources of spectral imagery to create large models pretrained on the task of masked reconstruction. In this paper, we present a foundation model framework, where the pretraining task captures the causal relationship between multiple modalities. Our framework leverages the knowledge guided principles that the spectral imagery captures the impact of the physical drivers on the environmental system, and that the relationship between them is governed by the characteristics of the system. Specifically, our method, called MultiModal Variable Step Forecasting (MM-VSF), uses forecasting of satellite imagery as a pretraining task and is able to capture the causal relationship between spectral imagery and weather. In our evaluation we show that the forecasting of satellite imagery using weather can be used as an effective pretraining task for foundation models. We further show the effectiveness of the embeddings produced by MM-VSF on the downstream tasks of pixel wise crop mapping and missing image prediction of spectral imagery, when compared with embeddings created by models trained in alternative pretraining settings including the traditional single modality input masked reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages with appendix</p></details> |

However, such models are tricky to efficiently train and often struggle to generalize beyond their training scenarios, limiting adaptability to new environments, tasks, and concepts. In this work, we investigate the minimal data requirements and architectural adaptations necessary to achieve robust closed-loop performance with vision-based control policies under unseen text instructions and visual distribution shifts. To this end, we design datasets with various levels of data representation richness, refine feature extraction protocols by leveraging multi-modal foundation model encoders, and assess the suitability of different policy network heads. Our findings are synthesized in Flex (Fly-lexically), a framework that uses pre-trained Vision Language Models (VLMs) as frozen patch-wise feature extractors, generating spatially aware embeddings that integrate semantic and visual information. These rich features form the basis for training highly robust downstream policies capable of generalizing across platforms, environments, and text-specified tasks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on quadrotor fly-to-target tasks, where agents trained via behavior cloning on a small simulated dataset successfully generalize to real-world scenes, handling diverse novel goals and command formulations.</p></details> |  |

In our work, we analyze several prominent models such as Whisper, Seamless, Wav2Vec, HuBERT, and Qwen2-Audio focusing on their learned representations in both paralinguistic and non-paralinguistic tasks from the Dynamic-SUPERB benchmark. Our study addresses three key questions: (1) What non-verbal cues (e.g., speaker intent, emotion, environmental context) are captured? (2) How are these cues represented across different layers of the models? and (3) To what extent can these representations be effectively adapted to downstream tasks? To answer these questions, we first evaluate the models in a zero-shot setting, followed by fine-tuning on layer-wise features extracted from these models. Our results provide insights into the models' capacity for generalization, the characteristics of their layer-wise representations, and the degree of transformation required for downstream task adaptation. Our findings suggest that some of these models perform well on various tasks in zero-shot settings, despite not being explicitly trained for those tasks. We also observe that zero-shot performance correlates with better-learned representations. The analysis of layer-wise features demonstrates that some models exhibit a convex relationship between the separability of the learned representations and model depth, with different layers capturing task-specific features.</p></details> | 20 Pages |
| **[Multi-View Multi-Task Modeling with Speech Foundation Models for Speech Forensic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12947v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech forensic tasks (SFTs), such as automatic speaker recognition (ASR), speech emotion recognition (SER), gender recognition (GR), and age estimation (AE), find use in different security and biometric applications. Previous works have applied various techniques, with recent studies focusing on applying speech foundation models (SFMs) for improved performance. However, most prior efforts have centered on building individual models for each task separately, despite the inherent similarities among these tasks. This isolated approach results in higher computational resource requirements, increased costs, time consumption, and maintenance challenges. In this study, we address these challenges by employing a multi-task learning strategy. Firstly, we explore the various state-of-the-art (SOTA) SFMs by extracting their representations for learning these SFTs and investigating their effectiveness at each task specifically. Secondly, we analyze the performance of the extracted representations on the SFTs in a multi-task learning framework. We observe a decline in performance when SFTs are modeled together compared to individual task-specific models, and as a remedy, we propose multi-view learning (MVL). Views are representations from different SFMs transformed into distinct abstract spaces by characteristics unique to each SFM. By leveraging MVL, we integrate these diverse representations to capture complementary information across tasks, enhancing the shared learning process. We introduce a new framework called TANGO (Task Alignment with iNter-view Gated Optimal transport) to implement this approach. With TANGO, we achieve the topmost performance in comparison to individual SFM representations as well as baseline fusion techniques across benchmark datasets such as CREMA-D, emo-DB, and BAVED.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Graph Foundation Models: The Perspective of Zero-shot Reasoning on Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12609v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the success of artificial general intelligence, there is a trend towards developing Graph Foundation Models that excel in generalization across various graph tasks and domains. However, current models often require extensive training or fine-tuning to capture structural and semantic insights on new graphs, which limits their versatility. In this work, we explore graph foundation models from the perspective of zero-shot reasoning on Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Our focus is on utilizing KGs as a unified topological structure to tackle diverse tasks, while addressing semantic isolation challenges in KG reasoning to effectively integrate diverse semantic and structural features. This brings us new methodological insights into KG reasoning, as well as high generalizability towards foundation models in practice. Methodologically, we introduce SCORE, a unified graph reasoning framework that effectively generalizes diverse graph tasks using zero-shot learning. At the core of SCORE is semantic conditional message passing, a technique designed to capture both structural and semantic invariances in graphs, with theoretical backing for its expressive power. Practically, we evaluate the zero-shot reasoning capability of SCORE using 38 diverse graph datasets, covering node-level, link-level, and graph-level tasks across multiple domains. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance improvement over prior foundation models and supervised baselines, highlighting the efficacy and adaptability of our approach.</p></details> | 17 Pages, 5 figures |

| **[Developing Generalist Foundation Models from a Multimodal Dataset for 3D Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17834v2)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While computer vision has achieved tremendous success with multimodal encoding and direct textual interaction with images via chat-based large language models, similar advancements in medical imaging AI, particularly in 3D imaging, have been limited due to the scarcity of comprehensive datasets. To address this critical gap, we introduce CT-RATE, the first dataset that pairs 3D medical images with corresponding textual reports. CT-RATE comprises 25,692 non-contrast 3D chest CT scans from 21,304 unique patients. Through various reconstructions, these scans are expanded to 50,188 volumes, totaling over 14.3 million 2D slices. Each scan is accompanied by its corresponding radiology report. Leveraging CT-RATE, we develop CT-CLIP, a CT-focused contrastive language-image pretraining framework designed for broad applications without the need for task-specific training. We demonstrate how CT-CLIP can be used in two tasks: multi-abnormality detection and case retrieval. Remarkably, in multi-abnormality detection, CT-CLIP outperforms state-of-the-art fully supervised models across all key metrics, effectively eliminating the need for manual annotation. In case retrieval, it efficiently retrieves relevant cases using either image or textual queries, thereby enhancing knowledge dissemination. By combining CT-CLIP's vision encoder with a pretrained large language model, we create CT-CHAT, a vision-language foundational chat model for 3D chest CT volumes. Finetuned on over 2.7 million question-answer pairs derived from the CT-RATE dataset, CT-CHAT surpasses other multimodal AI assistants, underscoring the necessity for specialized methods in 3D medical imaging. Collectively, the open-source release of CT-RATE, CT-CLIP, and CT-CHAT not only addresses critical challenges in 3D medical imaging but also lays the groundwork for future innovations in medical AI and improved patient care.</p></details> |  |

In the last few years, multiple deep learning based pan-Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) forecasting methods have emerged and showcased superior performance over physics-based dynamical models. However, previous methods forecast SIC at a fixed temporal granularity, e.g. sub-seasonal or seasonal, thus only leveraging inter-granularity information and overlooking the plentiful inter-granularity correlations. SIC at various temporal granularities exhibits cumulative effects and are naturally consistent, with short-term fluctuations potentially impacting long-term trends and long-term trends provides effective hints for facilitating short-term forecasts in Arctic sea ice. Therefore, in this study, we propose to cultivate temporal multi-granularity that naturally derived from Arctic sea ice reanalysis data and provide a unified perspective for modeling SIC via our Sea Ice Foundation Model. SIFM is delicately designed to leverage both intra-granularity and inter-granularity information for capturing granularity-consistent representations that promote forecasting skills. Our extensive experiments show that SIFM outperforms off-the-shelf deep learning models for their specific temporal granularity.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Towards Neural Scaling Laws for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12360v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling laws offer valuable insights into the design of time series foundation models (TSFMs). However, previous research has largely focused on the scaling laws of TSFMs for in-distribution (ID) data, leaving their out-of-distribution (OOD) scaling behavior and the influence of model architectures less explored. In this work, we examine two common TSFM architectures, encoder-only and decoder-only Transformers, and investigate their scaling behavior on both ID and OOD data. These models are trained and evaluated across varying parameter counts, compute budgets, and dataset sizes. Our experiments reveal that the log-likelihood loss of TSFMs exhibits similar scaling behavior in both OOD and ID settings. We further compare the scaling properties across different architectures, incorporating two state-of-the-art TSFMs as case studies, showing that model architecture plays a significant role in scaling. The encoder-only Transformers demonstrate better scalability than the decoder-only Transformers, while the architectural enhancements in the two advanced TSFMs primarily improve ID performance but reduce OOD scalability. While scaling up TSFMs is expected to drive performance breakthroughs, the lack of a comprehensive understanding of TSFM scaling laws has hindered the development of a robust framework to guide model scaling. We fill this gap in this work by synthesizing our findings and providing practical guidelines for designing and scaling larger TSFMs with enhanced model capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, deploying LLMs on edge devices is trending for efficiency and privacy reasons. However, edge deployment of proprietary LLMs introduces new security threats: attackers who obtain an edge-deployed LLM can easily use it as a base model for various tasks due to its high generalization ability, which we call foundational capability stealing. Unfortunately, existing model protection mechanisms are often task-specific and fail to protect general-purpose LLMs, as they mainly focus on protecting task-related parameters using trusted execution environments (TEEs). Although some recent TEE-based methods are able to protect the overall model parameters in a computation-efficient way, they still suffer from prohibitive communication costs between TEE and CPU/GPU, making it impractical to deploy for edge LLMs. To protect the foundational capabilities of edge LLMs, we propose CoreGuard, a computation- and communication-efficient model protection approach against model stealing on edge devices. The core component of CoreGuard is a lightweight and propagative authorization module residing in TEE. Extensive experiments show that CoreGuard achieves the same security protection as the black-box security guarantees with negligible overhead.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a prompt-based KG foundation model via in-context learning, namely KG-ICL, to achieve a universal reasoning ability. Specifically, we introduce a prompt graph centered with a query-related example fact as context to understand the query relation. To encode prompt graphs with the generalization ability to unseen entities and relations in queries, we first propose a unified tokenizer that maps entities and relations in prompt graphs to predefined tokens. Then, we propose two message passing neural networks to perform prompt encoding and KG reasoning, respectively. We conduct evaluation on 43 different KGs in both transductive and inductive settings. Results indicate that the proposed KG-ICL outperforms baselines on most datasets, showcasing its outstanding generalization and universal reasoning capabilities.

| **[ViLReF: An Expert Knowledge Enabled Vision-Language Retinal Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10894v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subtle semantic differences in retinal image and text data present great challenges for pre-training visual-language models. Moreover, false negative samples, i.e., image-text pairs having the same semantics but incorrectly regarded as negatives, disrupt the visual-language pre-training process and affect the model's learning ability. This work aims to develop a retinal foundation model, called ViLReF, by pre-training on a paired dataset comprising 451,956 retinal images and corresponding diagnostic text reports. In our vision-language pre-training strategy, we leverage expert knowledge to facilitate the extraction of labels and propose a novel constraint, the Weighted Similarity Coupling Loss, to adjust the speed of pushing sample pairs further apart dynamically within the feature space. Furthermore, we employ a batch expansion module with dynamic memory queues, maintained by momentum encoders, to supply extra samples and compensate for the vacancies caused by eliminating false negatives. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple datasets for downstream classification and segmentation tasks. The experimental results demonstrate the powerful zero-shot and transfer learning capabilities of ViLReF, verifying the effectiveness of our pre-training strategy. Our ViLReF model is available at: https://github.com/T6Yang/ViLReF.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rewards-in-Context: Multi-objective Alignment of Foundation Models with Dynamic Preference Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10207v6)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of multi-objective alignment of foundation models with human preferences, which is a critical step towards helpful and harmless AI systems. However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[TransAgent: Transfer Vision-Language Foundation Models with Heterogeneous Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12183v1)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language foundation models (such as CLIP) have recently shown their power in transfer learning, owing to large-scale image-text pre-training. However, target domain data in the downstream tasks can be highly different from the pre-training phase, which makes it hard for such a single model to generalize well. Alternatively, there exists a wide range of expert models that contain diversified vision and/or language knowledge pre-trained on different modalities, tasks, networks, and datasets. Unfortunately, these models are "isolated agents" with heterogeneous structures, and how to integrate their knowledge for generalizing CLIP-like models has not been fully explored. To bridge this gap, we propose a general and concise TransAgent framework, which transports the knowledge of the isolated agents in a unified manner, and effectively guides CLIP to generalize with multi-source knowledge distillation. With such a distinct framework, we flexibly collaborate with 11 heterogeneous agents to empower vision-language foundation models, without further cost in the inference phase. Finally, our TransAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 visual recognition datasets. Under the same low-shot setting, it outperforms the popular CoOp with around 10% on average, and 20% on EuroSAT which contains large domain shifts.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Lotus: Diffusion-based Visual Foundation Model for High-quality Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124v3)** | 2024-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

When analyzing a graph's statistical properties, graph laws serve as essential tools for parameterizing its structure. Identifying meaningful graph laws can significantly enhance the effectiveness of various applications, such as graph generation and link prediction. Facing the large-scale foundation model developments nowadays, the study of graph laws reveals new research potential, e.g., providing multi-modal information for graph neural representation learning and breaking the domain inconsistency of different graph data. In this survey, we first review the previous study of graph laws from multiple perspectives, i.e., macroscope and microscope of graphs, low-order and high-order graphs, static and dynamic graphs, different observation spaces, and newly proposed graph parameters. After we review various real-world applications benefiting from the guidance of graph laws, we conclude the paper with current challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | Preprint, 15 pages |
| **[A Phenomenological AI Foundation Model for Physical Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14724v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The objective of this work is to develop an AI foundation model for physical signals that can generalize across diverse phenomena, domains, applications, and sensing apparatuses. We propose a phenomenological approach and framework for creating and validating such AI foundation models. Based on this framework, we developed and trained a model on 0.59 billion samples of cross-modal sensor measurements, ranging from electrical current to fluid flow to optical sensors. Notably, no prior knowledge of physical laws or inductive biases were introduced into the model. Through several real-world experiments, we demonstrate that a single foundation model could effectively encode and predict physical behaviors, such as mechanical motion and thermodynamics, including phenomena not seen in training. The model also scales across physical processes of varying complexity, from tracking the trajectory of a simple spring-mass system to forecasting large electrical grid dynamics. This work highlights the potential of building a unified AI foundation model for diverse physical world processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Series Foundation Model for Value-at-Risk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11773v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study is the first to explore the application of a time-series foundation model for VaR estimation. Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that, in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio, the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. We also found that fine-tuning significantly improves the results, and the model should not be used in zero-shot settings. Overall, foundation models can provide completely alternative approaches to traditional econometric methods, yet there are challenges to be tackled.</p></details> |  |

They are a new emerging technique widely used in Generative Artificial Intelligence, characterized by their scalability and their use in Transfer Learning. The enormous and heterogeneous amounts of data used in their initial training phase, known as pre-training, give them a higher generalization capacity than any other specific model, constituting a solid base that can be adapted or adjusted to a wide range of tasks, increasing their applicability. This study proposes LLIAM, the Llama Lora-Integrated Autorregresive Model. Low-Rank Adaptations are used to enhance the knowledge of the model with diverse time series datasets, known as the fine-tuning phase. To illustrate the capabilities of our proposal, two sets of experiments have been carried out that obtained favorable and promising results with lower training times than other Deep Learning approaches. With this work, we also encourage the use of available resources (such as these pre-trained models) to avoid unnecessary and costly training, narrowing the gap between the goals of traditional Artificial Intelligence and those specified by the definition of Green Artificial Intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Championing Foundation Models: From Explainability to Interpretability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11444v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the inner mechanisms of black-box foundation models (FMs) is essential yet challenging in artificial intelligence and its applications. Over the last decade, the long-running focus has been on their explainability, leading to the development of post-hoc explainable methods to rationalize the specific decisions already made by black-box FMs. However, these explainable methods have certain limitations in terms of faithfulness, detail capture and resource requirement. Consequently, in response to these issues, a new class of interpretable methods should be considered to unveil the underlying mechanisms in an accurate, comprehensive, heuristic and resource-light way. This survey aims to review interpretable methods that comply with the aforementioned principles and have been successfully applied to FMs. These methods are deeply rooted in machine learning theory, covering the analysis of generalization performance, expressive capability, and dynamic behavior. They provide a thorough interpretation of the entire workflow of FMs, ranging from the inference capability and training dynamics to their ethical implications. Ultimately, drawing upon these interpretations, this review identifies the next frontier research directions for FMs.</p></details> | 45 pages, 14 figures |

This study comprehensively evaluates foundation models for ECGs, leveraging SSL methods, including generative and contrastive learning, on a vast dataset comprising approximately 1.3 million ECG samples. By integrating these methods with consideration of the unique characteristics of ECGs, we developed a Hybrid Learning (HL) for foundation models that improve the precision and reliability of cardiac diagnostics. The HL-based foundation model adeptly captures the intricate details of ECGs, enhancing diagnostic capability. The results underscore the considerable potential of SSL-enhanced foundation models in clinical settings, setting the stage for future research into their scalable applications across a broader range of medical diagnostics. This work sets a new standard in the ECG field, emphasizing the transformative influence of tailored, data-driven model training on the effectiveness and accuracy of medical diagnostics.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[GraphCLIP: Enhancing Transferability in Graph Foundation Models for Text-Attributed Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10329v2)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, research on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs) has gained significant attention due to the prevalence of free-text node features in real-world applications and the advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that bolster TAG methodologies. However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

The emergence of foundation models as the "brain" of EAI agents for high-level task planning has shown promising results. However, the deployment of these agents in physical environments presents significant safety challenges. For instance, a housekeeping robot lacking sufficient risk awareness might place a metal container in a microwave, potentially causing a fire. To address these critical safety concerns, comprehensive pre-deployment risk assessments are imperative. This study introduces EAIRiskBench, a novel framework for automated physical risk assessment in EAI scenarios. EAIRiskBench employs a multi-agent cooperative system that leverages various foundation models to generate safety guidelines, create risk-prone scenarios, make task planning, and evaluate safety systematically. Utilizing this framework, we construct EAIRiskDataset, comprising diverse test cases across various domains, encompassing both textual and visual scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art foundation models reveals alarming results: all models exhibit high task risk rates (TRR), with an average of 95.75% across all evaluated models. To address these challenges, we further propose two prompting-based risk mitigation strategies. While these strategies demonstrate some efficacy in reducing TRR, the improvements are limited, still indicating substantial safety concerns. This study provides the first large-scale assessment of physical risk awareness in EAI agents. Our findings underscore the critical need for enhanced safety measures in EAI systems and provide valuable insights for future research directions in developing safer embodied artificial intelligence system.</p></details> |  |

Despite producing high-quality samples, existing methods are constrained to generating images of scenes at a limited scale. In this paper, we present MetaEarth, a generative foundation model that breaks the barrier by scaling image generation to a global level, exploring the creation of worldwide, multi-resolution, unbounded, and virtually limitless remote sensing images. In MetaEarth, we propose a resolution-guided self-cascading generative framework, which enables the generating of images at any region with a wide range of geographical resolutions. To achieve unbounded and arbitrary-sized image generation, we design a novel noise sampling strategy for denoising diffusion models by analyzing the generation conditions and initial noise. To train MetaEarth, we construct a large dataset comprising multi-resolution optical remote sensing images with geographical information. Experiments have demonstrated the powerful capabilities of our method in generating global-scale images. Additionally, the MetaEarth serves as a data engine that can provide high-quality and rich training data for downstream tasks. Our model opens up new possibilities for constructing generative world models by simulating Earth visuals from an innovative overhead perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jiupinjia.github.io/metaearth/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for 3D Vision: How Close Are We?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10799v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a foundation model for 3D vision is a complex challenge that remains unsolved. Towards that goal, it is important to understand the 3D reasoning capabilities of current models as well as identify the gaps between these models and humans. Therefore, we construct a new 3D visual understanding benchmark that covers fundamental 3D vision tasks in the Visual Question Answering (VQA) format. We evaluate state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), specialized models, and human subjects on it. Our results show that VLMs generally perform poorly, while the specialized models are accurate but not robust, failing under geometric perturbations. In contrast, human vision continues to be the most reliable 3D visual system. We further demonstrate that neural networks align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms compared to classical computer vision methods, and Transformer-based networks such as ViT align more closely with human 3D vision mechanisms than CNNs. We hope our study will benefit the future development of foundation models for 3D vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Words to Wheels: Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Understanding Human Language Instructions Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10577v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an innovative application of foundation models, enabling Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) equipped with an RGB-D camera to navigate to designated destinations based on human language instructions. Unlike learning-based methods, this approach does not require prior training but instead leverages existing foundation models, thus facilitating generalization to novel environments. Upon receiving human language instructions, these are transformed into a 'cognitive route description' using a large language model (LLM)-a detailed navigation route expressed in human language. The vehicle then decomposes this description into landmarks and navigation maneuvers. The vehicle also determines elevation costs and identifies navigability levels of different regions through a terrain segmentation model, GANav, trained on open datasets. Semantic elevation costs, which take both elevation and navigability levels into account, are estimated and provided to the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) planner, responsible for local path planning. Concurrently, the vehicle searches for target landmarks using foundation models, including YOLO-World and EfficientViT-SAM. Ultimately, the vehicle executes the navigation commands to reach the designated destination, the final landmark. Our experiments demonstrate that this application successfully guides UGVs to their destinations following human language instructions in novel environments, such as unfamiliar terrain or urban settings.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Moirai-MoE: Empowering Time Series Foundation Models with Sparse Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10469v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance as zero-shot forecasters. However, achieving effectively unified training on time series remains an open challenge. Existing approaches introduce some level of model specialization to account for the highly heterogeneous nature of time series data. For instance, Moirai pursues unified training by employing multiple input/output projection layers, each tailored to handle time series at a specific frequency. Similarly, TimesFM maintains a frequency embedding dictionary for this purpose. We identify two major drawbacks to this human-imposed frequency-level model specialization: (1) Frequency is not a reliable indicator of the underlying patterns in time series. For example, time series with different frequencies can display similar patterns, while those with the same frequency may exhibit varied patterns. (2) Non-stationarity is an inherent property of real-world time series, leading to varied distributions even within a short context window of a single time series. Frequency-level specialization is too coarse-grained to capture this level of diversity. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Moirai-MoE, using a single input/output projection layer while delegating the modeling of diverse time series patterns to the sparse mixture of experts (MoE) within Transformers. With these designs, Moirai-MoE reduces reliance on human-defined heuristics and enables automatic token-level specialization. Extensive experiments on 39 datasets demonstrate the superiority of Moirai-MoE over existing foundation models in both in-distribution and zero-shot scenarios. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive model analyses to explore the inner workings of time series MoE foundation models and provides valuable insights for future research.</p></details> |  |

To address the need for data privacy in FM fine-tuning, federated learning has emerged as the de facto framework. Specifically, Federated FMs (FedFMs) fine-tuning using low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules instead of the full model over multiple clients can achieve both parameter efficiency and data privacy. However, recent studies rarely address the challenges posed by clients with heterogeneous resources, particularly in GPU memory capacity. In this paper, we introduce Fed-piLot, an efficient FedFM fine-tuning framework with optimized local LoRA assignments for heterogeneous clients. By emphasizing the different memory consumption for training different LoRA layers, as well as the varying contributions of different layers to model performance, we formulate the LoRA assignment as a Knapsack Optimization Problem. We design a Local-Global Information Gain Score (IG-Score) based value function to optimize LoRA assignment under clients' memory constraints. To further mitigate the impact of heterogeneity in model updates, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal model aggregation (STAgg) rule using the Dynamic Weight Adjustment (DWA) strategy. Experimental results on three datasets under both IID and non-IID conditions demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of Fed-piLot. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Several state-of-the-art methods for few-shot segmentation have emerged, including text-based prompting for the task but suffer from sub-optimal performance for medical images. Leveraging sub-pixel level features of existing Vision Transformer (ViT) based foundation models for identifying similar region of interest (RoI) based on a single template image have been shown to be very effective for one shot segmentation and localization in medical images across modalities. However, such methods rely on assumption that template image and test image are well matched and simple correlation is sufficient to obtain correspondences. In practice, however such an approach can fail to generalize in clinical data due to patient pose changes, inter-protocol variations even within a single modality or extend to 3D data using single template image. Moreover, for multi-label tasks, the RoI identification has to be performed sequentially. In this work, we propose foundation model (FM) based adapters for single label, multi-label localization and segmentation to address these concerns. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method for multiple segmentation and localization tasks for both 2D and 3D data as we well as clinical data with different poses and evaluate against the state of the art few shot segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |

We explore the rationale, design, and implementation of such registries, drawing on comparisons with registries in analogous industries to make recommendations for a registry that is efficient, unintrusive, and which will bring AI governance closer to parity with the governmental insight into other high-impact industries. We explore key information that should be collected, including model architecture, model size, compute and data used during training, and we survey the viability and utility of evaluations developed specifically for AI. Our proposal is designed to provide governmental insight and enhance AI safety while fostering innovation and minimizing the regulatory burden on developers. By providing a framework that respects intellectual property concerns and safeguards sensitive information, this registry approach supports responsible AI development without impeding progress. We propose that timely and accurate registration should be encouraged primarily through injunctive action, by requiring third parties to use only registered models, and secondarily through direct financial penalties for non-compliance. By providing a comprehensive framework for AI model registries, we aim to support policymakers in developing foundational governance structures to monitor and mitigate risks associated with advanced AI systems.</p></details> |  |

The most effective techniques for matching keypoints currently involve using learned sparse or dense matchers, which need pairs of images. These neural networks have a good general understanding of features from both images, but they often struggle to match points from different semantic areas. This paper presents a new method that uses semantic cues from foundation vision model features (like DINOv2) to enhance local feature matching by incorporating semantic reasoning into existing descriptors. Therefore, the learned descriptors do not require image pairs at inference time, allowing feature caching and fast matching using similarity search, unlike learned matchers. We present adapted versions of six existing descriptors, with an average increase in performance of 29% in camera localization, with comparable accuracy to existing matchers as LightGlue and LoFTR in two existing benchmarks.

While various studies have analyzed statistical, machine learning, or deep learning approaches for household electricity STLF, recently proposed time series foundation models such as Chronos, TimesFM, or LagLlama have not yet been considered for household electricity STLF. These models are trained on a vast amount of time series data and are able to forecast time series without explicit task-specific training (zero-shot learning). In this study, we benchmark the forecasting capabilities of time series foundation models compared to Trained-from-Scratch (TFS) Transformer-based approaches. Our results suggest that foundation models perform comparably to TFS Transformer models, while the TimesFM foundation model outperforms all TFS models when the input size increases. At the same time, they require less effort, as they need no domain-specific training and only limited contextual data for inference.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pretrained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA's efficiency. We evaluate the method on various Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation.

Despite advancements in multi-modal pre-trained models and video-language foundation models, these systems often struggle with domain-specific VideoQA due to their generalized pre-training objectives. Addressing this gap necessitates bridging the divide between broad cross-modal knowledge and the specific inference demands of VideoQA tasks. To this end, we introduce HeurVidQA, a framework that leverages domain-specific entity-action heuristics to refine pre-trained video-language foundation models. Our approach treats these models as implicit knowledge engines, employing domain-specific entity-action prompters to direct the model's focus toward precise cues that enhance reasoning. By delivering fine-grained heuristics, we improve the model's ability to identify and interpret key entities and actions, thereby enhancing its reasoning capabilities. Extensive evaluations across multiple VideoQA datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing models, underscoring the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge into video-language models for more accurate and context-aware VideoQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> |

We leverage a foundational 3D model trained extensively on point cloud data. Drawing from recent improvements in foundation models, known for their ability to work well across different tasks, we propose a novel strategy that does not require additional training to adapt to new tasks. Our approach uses a dual cache system: first, it uses previous test samples based on how confident the model was in its predictions to prevent forgetting, and second, it includes a small number of new task samples to prevent overfitting. This dynamic adaptation ensures strong performance across different learning tasks without needing lots of fine-tuning. We tested our approach on datasets like ModelNet, ShapeNet, ScanObjectNN, and CO3D, showing that it outperforms other FSCIL methods and demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

| **[Software Engineering and Foundation Models: Insights from Industry Blogs Using a Jury of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09012v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many fields, including software engineering (SE). The interaction between SE and FMs has led to the integration of FMs into SE practices (FM4SE) and the application of SE methodologies to FMs (SE4FM). While several literature surveys exist on academic contributions to these trends, we are the first to provide a practitioner's view. We analyze 155 FM4SE and 997 SE4FM blog posts from leading technology companies, leveraging an FM-powered surveying approach to systematically label and summarize the discussed activities and tasks. We observed that while code generation is the most prominent FM4SE task, FMs are leveraged for many other SE activities such as code understanding, summarization, and API recommendation. The majority of blog posts on SE4FM are about model deployment & operation, and system architecture & orchestration. Although the emphasis is on cloud deployments, there is a growing interest in compressing FMs and deploying them on smaller devices such as edge or mobile devices. We outline eight future research directions inspired by our gained insights, aiming to bridge the gap between academic findings and real-world applications. Our study not only enriches the body of knowledge on practical applications of FM4SE and SE4FM but also demonstrates the utility of FMs as a powerful and efficient approach in conducting literature surveys within technical and grey literature domains.

| **[Controlling Whisper: Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attacks to Control Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04482v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech enabled foundation models, either in the form of flexible speech recognition based systems or audio-prompted large language models (LLMs), are becoming increasingly popular. One of the interesting aspects of these models is their ability to perform tasks other than automatic speech recognition (ASR) using an appropriate prompt. For example, the OpenAI Whisper model can perform both speech transcription and speech translation. With the development of audio-prompted LLMs there is the potential for even greater control options. In this work we demonstrate that with this greater flexibility the systems can be susceptible to model-control adversarial attacks. Without any access to the model prompt it is possible to modify the behaviour of the system by appropriately changing the audio input. To illustrate this risk, we demonstrate that it is possible to prepend a short universal adversarial acoustic segment to any input speech signal to override the prompt setting of an ASR foundation model. Specifically, we successfully use a universal adversarial acoustic segment to control Whisper to always perform speech translation, despite being set to perform speech transcription. Overall, this work demonstrates a new form of adversarial attack on multi-tasking speech enabled foundation models that needs to be considered prior to the deployment of this form of model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors: Let the Embodied Agent Efficiently Learn on Its Own](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02635v4)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a promising approach for solving robotic manipulation tasks. However, it is challenging to apply the RL algorithms directly in the real world. For one thing, RL is data-intensive and typically requires millions of interactions with environments, which are impractical in real scenarios. For another, it is necessary to make heavy engineering efforts to design reward functions manually. To address these issues, we leverage foundation models in this paper. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors (RLFP) to utilize guidance and feedback from policy, value, and success-reward foundation models. Within this framework, we introduce the Foundation-guided Actor-Critic (FAC) algorithm, which enables embodied agents to explore more efficiently with automatic reward functions. The benefits of our framework are threefold: (1) \textit{sample efficient}; (2) \textit{minimal and effective reward engineering}; (3) \textit{agnostic to foundation model forms and robust to noisy priors}. Our method achieves remarkable performances in various manipulation tasks on both real robots and in simulation. Across 5 dexterous tasks with real robots, FAC achieves an average success rate of 86\% after one hour of real-time learning. Across 8 tasks in the simulated Meta-world, FAC achieves 100\% success rates in 7/8 tasks under less than 100k frames (about 1-hour training), outperforming baseline methods with manual-designed rewards in 1M frames. We believe the RLFP framework can enable future robots to explore and learn autonomously in the physical world for more tasks.

| **[A foundation model for generalizable disease diagnosis in chest X-ray images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08861v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing the interpretation of chest X-ray (CXR) images by providing robust tools for disease diagnosis. However, the effectiveness of these AI models is often limited by their reliance on large amounts of task-specific labeled data and their inability to generalize across diverse clinical settings. To address these challenges, we introduce CXRBase, a foundational model designed to learn versatile representations from unlabelled CXR images, facilitating efficient adaptation to various clinical tasks. CXRBase is initially trained on a substantial dataset of 1.04 million unlabelled CXR images using self-supervised learning methods. This approach allows the model to discern meaningful patterns without the need for explicit labels. After this initial phase, CXRBase is fine-tuned with labeled data to enhance its performance in disease detection, enabling accurate classification of chest diseases. CXRBase provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and alleviate the annotation workload of experts to enable broad clinical AI applications from chest imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[CryoFM: A Flow-based Foundation Model for Cryo-EM Densities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08631v1)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a powerful technique in structural biology and drug discovery, enabling the study of biomolecules at high resolution. Significant advancements by structural biologists using cryo-EM have led to the production of over 38,626 protein density maps at various resolutions1. However, cryo-EM data processing algorithms have yet to fully benefit from our knowledge of biomolecular density maps, with only a few recent models being data-driven but limited to specific tasks. In this study, we present CryoFM, a foundation model designed as a generative model, learning the distribution of high-quality density maps and generalizing effectively to downstream tasks. Built on flow matching, CryoFM is trained to accurately capture the prior distribution of biomolecular density maps. Furthermore, we introduce a flow posterior sampling method that leverages CRYOFM as a flexible prior for several downstream tasks in cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET) without the need for fine-tuning, achieving state-of-the-art performance on most tasks and demonstrating its potential as a foundational model for broader applications in these fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Specific Adaptation of Segmentation Foundation Model via Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09199v2)** | 2024-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, foundation models trained on massive datasets to adapt to a wide range of tasks have attracted considerable attention and are actively being explored within the computer vision community. Among these, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands out for its remarkable progress in generalizability and flexibility for image segmentation tasks, achieved through prompt-based object mask generation. However, despite its strength, SAM faces two key limitations when applied to instance segmentation that segments specific objects or those in unique environments (e.g., task-specific adaptation for out-of-distribution objects) not typically present in the training data: 1) the ambiguity inherent in input prompts and 2) the necessity for extensive additional training to achieve optimal segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a task-specific adaptation (i.e., customization) of the segmentation foundation model via prompt learning tailored to SAM. Our method involves a prompt learning module (PLM), which adjusts input prompts into the embedding space to better align with peculiarities of the target task, thereby enabling more efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a point matching module (PMM) to enhance the feature representation for finer segmentation by ensuring detailed alignment with ground truth boundaries. Experimental results on various customized segmentation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop on OOD Generalization in Computer Vision, ECCV 2024</p></details> |

BPM is the practice of documenting, measuring, improving, and automating enterprise workflows. However, research has focused almost exclusively on one task - full end-to-end automation using agents based on multimodal foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4. This focus on automation ignores the reality of how most BPM tools are applied today - simply documenting the relevant workflow takes 60% of the time of the typical process optimization project. To address this gap we present WONDERBREAD, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal FMs on BPM tasks beyond automation. Our contributions are: (1) a dataset containing 2928 documented workflow demonstrations; (2) 6 novel BPM tasks sourced from real-world applications ranging from workflow documentation to knowledge transfer to process improvement; and (3) an automated evaluation harness. Our benchmark shows that while state-of-the-art FMs can automatically generate documentation (e.g. recalling 88% of the steps taken in a video demonstration of a workflow), they struggle to re-apply that knowledge towards finer-grained validation of workflow completion (F1 < 0.3). We hope WONDERBREAD encourages the development of more "human-centered" AI tooling for enterprise applications and furthers the exploration of multimodal FMs for the broader universe of BPM tasks. We publish our dataset and experiments here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/wonderbread</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08288v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is essential for modeling complex decision-making problems but faces challenges in computational tractability and requires expert formulation. Current deep learning approaches for MILP focus on specific problem classes and do not generalize to unseen classes. To address this shortcoming, we take a foundation model training approach, where we train a single deep learning model on a diverse set of MILP problems to generalize across problem classes. As existing datasets for MILP lack diversity and volume, we introduce MILP-Evolve, a novel LLM-based evolutionary framework that is capable of generating a large set of diverse MILP classes with an unlimited amount of instances. We study our methodology on three key learning tasks that capture diverse aspects of MILP: (1) integrality gap prediction, (2) learning to branch, and (3) a new task of aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions. Our empirical results show that models trained on the data generated by MILP-Evolve achieve significant improvements on unseen problems, including MIPLIB benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of moving towards a foundation model approach for MILP that can generalize to a broad range of MILP applications. We are committed to fully open-sourcing our work to advance further research.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this, we introduce Theia, a vision foundation model for robot learning that distills multiple off-the-shelf vision foundation models trained on varied vision tasks. Theia's rich visual representations encode diverse visual knowledge, enhancing downstream robot learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Theia outperforms its teacher models and prior robot learning models using less training data and smaller model sizes. Additionally, we quantify the quality of pre-trained visual representations and hypothesize that higher entropy in feature norm distributions leads to improved robot learning performance.

| **[Mapping the Unseen: Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping with Dynamic Labeling using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02162v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics and computer vision, efficient and accurate semantic mapping remains a significant challenge due to the growing demand for intelligent machines that can comprehend and interact with complex environments. Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is under consideration at Pattern Recognition Letters</p></details> |

Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large) and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML'24.

| **[RDT-1B: a Diffusion Foundation Model for Bimanual Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07864v1)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bimanual manipulation is essential in robotics, yet developing foundation models is extremely challenging due to the inherent complexity of coordinating two robot arms (leading to multi-modal action distributions) and the scarcity of training data. In this paper, we present the Robotics Diffusion Transformer (RDT), a pioneering diffusion foundation model for bimanual manipulation. RDT builds on diffusion models to effectively represent multi-modality, with innovative designs of a scalable Transformer to deal with the heterogeneity of multi-modal inputs and to capture the nonlinearity and high frequency of robotic data. To address data scarcity, we further introduce a Physically Interpretable Unified Action Space, which can unify the action representations of various robots while preserving the physical meanings of original actions, facilitating learning transferrable physical knowledge. With these designs, we managed to pre-train RDT on the largest collection of multi-robot datasets to date and scaled it up to 1.2B parameters, which is the largest diffusion-based foundation model for robotic manipulation. We finally fine-tuned RDT on a self-created multi-task bimanual dataset with over 6K+ episodes to refine its manipulation capabilities. Experiments on real robots demonstrate that RDT significantly outperforms existing methods. It exhibits zero-shot generalization to unseen objects and scenes, understands and follows language instructions, learns new skills with just 1~5 demonstrations, and effectively handles complex, dexterous tasks.

| **[ByteCheckpoint: A Unified Checkpointing System for Large Foundation Model Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20143v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Checkpointing to preserve training states is crucial during the development of Large Foundation Models (LFMs), for training resumption upon various failures or changes in GPU resources and parallelism configurations. In addition, saved checkpoints are dispatched to evaluation tasks or transferred across different training stages (e.g., from pre-training to post-training). All these scenarios require resharding distributed checkpoints from one parallelism to another. In production, different LFMs are trained with various frameworks and storage backends, depending on model sizes and training scales. A high-performance checkpointing system is needed to enable efficient checkpoint management at scale. This paper presents ByteCheckpoint, an industrial-grade checkpointing system for large-scale LFM training. ByteCheckpoint employs a parallelism-agnostic checkpoint representation that enables efficient load-time checkpoint resharding. ByteCheckpoint advocates a generic checkpoint saving/loading workflow to accommodate multiple training frameworks and support different storage backends. To ensure high I/O efficiency, we take a full-stack approach to optimize saving/loading plan generation, critical stages of checkpointing pipelines, and irregular tensor processing required by resharding. To guarantee the scalability of ByteCheckpoint in large-scale training, we enhance the storage system to efficiently handle high volumes of checkpointing I/O requests, devise communication optimizations within the checkpointing workflow, and introduce a suite of monitoring tools to analyze performance and detect bottlenecks. Compared to existing open-source checkpointing systems [40, 46], ByteCheckpoint significantly reduces runtime checkpoint stalls, achieving an average reduction of 54.20x. For saving and loading times, ByteCheckpoint achieves improvements of up to 9.96x and 8.80x, respectively.</p></details> |  |
