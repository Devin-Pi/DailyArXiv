| **[Exact Bayesian Inference for Multivariate Spatial Data of Any Size with Application to Air Pollution Monitoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02655v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine particulate matter and aerosol optical thickness are of interest to atmospheric scientists for understanding air quality and its various health/environmental impacts. The available data are extremely large, making uncertainty quantification in a fully Bayesian framework quite difficult, as traditional implementations do not scale reasonably to the size of the data. We specifically consider roughly 8 million observations obtained from NASA's Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrument. To analyze data on this scale, we introduce Scalable Multivariate Exact Posterior Regression (SM-EPR) which combines the recently introduced data subset approach and Exact Posterior Regression (EPR). EPR is a new Bayesian hierarchical model where it is possible to sample independent replicates of fixed and random effects directly from the posterior without the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or approximate Bayesian techniques. We extend EPR to the multivariate spatial context, where the multiple variables may be distributed according to different distributions. The combination of the data subset approach with EPR allows one to perform exact Bayesian inference without MCMC for effectively any sample size. We demonstrate our new SM-EPR method using this motivating big remote sensing data application and provide several simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Multi-Cuts for Online Multiple-Camera Vehicle Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02638v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate online multiple-camera vehicle tracking is essential for intelligent transportation systems, autonomous driving, and smart city applications. Like single-camera multiple-object tracking, it is commonly formulated as a graph problem of tracking-by-detection. Within this framework, existing online methods usually consist of two-stage procedures that cluster temporally first, then spatially, or vice versa. This is computationally expensive and prone to error accumulation. We introduce a graph representation that allows spatial-temporal clustering in a single, combined step: New detections are spatially and temporally connected with existing clusters. By keeping sparse appearance and positional cues of all detections in a cluster, our method can compare clusters based on the strongest available evidence. The final tracks are obtained online using a simple multicut assignment procedure. Our method does not require any training on the target scene, pre-extraction of single-camera tracks, or additional annotations. Notably, we outperform the online state-of-the-art on the CityFlow dataset in terms of IDF1 by more than 14%, and on the Synthehicle dataset by more than 25%, respectively. The code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Density based Spatial Clustering of Lines via Probabilistic Generation of Neighbourhood](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02290v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density based spatial clustering of points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has a myriad of applications in a variety of industries. We generalise this problem to the density based clustering of lines in high-dimensional spaces, keeping in mind there exists no valid distance measure that follows the triangle inequality for lines. In this paper, we design a clustering algorithm that generates a customised neighbourhood for a line of a fixed volume (given as a parameter), based on an optional parameter as a continuous probability density function. This algorithm is not sensitive to the outliers and can effectively identify the noise in the data using a cardinality parameter. One of the pivotal applications of this algorithm is clustering data points in $\mathbb{R}^n$ with missing entries, while utilising the domain knowledge of the respective data. In particular, the proposed algorithm is able to cluster $n$-dimensional data points that contain at least $(n-1)$-dimensional information. We illustrate the neighbourhoods for the standard probability distributions with continuous probability density functions and demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm on various synthetic and real-world datasets (e.g., rail and road networks). The experimental results also highlight its application in clustering incomplete data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Encoding arbitrary Ising Hamiltonians on Spatial Photonic Ising Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09161v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Photonic Ising Machines constitute an emergent new paradigm of computation, geared towards tackling combinatorial optimization problems that can be reduced to the problem of finding the ground state of an Ising model. Spatial Photonic Ising Machines have proven to be advantageous for simulating fully connected large-scale spin systems. However, fine control of a general interaction matrix $J$ has so far only been accomplished through eigenvalue decomposition methods that either limit the scalability or increase the execution time of the optimization process. We introduce and experimentally validate a SPIM instance that enables direct control over the full interaction matrix, enabling the encoding of Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary couplings and connectivity. We demonstrate the conformity of the experimentally measured Ising energy with the theoretically expected values and then proceed to solve both the unweighted and weighted graph partitioning problems, showcasing a systematic convergence to an optimal solution via simulated annealing. Our approach greatly expands the applicability of SPIMs for real-world applications without sacrificing any of the inherent advantages of the system, and paves the way to encoding the full range of NP problems that are known to be equivalent to Ising models, on SPIM devices.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Categorization of 33 computational methods to detect spatially variable genes from spatially resolved transcriptomics data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18779v4)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the analysis of spatially resolved transcriptomics data, detecting spatially variable genes (SVGs) is crucial. Numerous computational methods exist, but varying SVG definitions and methodologies lead to incomparable results. We review 33 state-of-the-art methods, categorizing SVGs into three types: overall, cell-type-specific, and spatial-domain-marker SVGs. Our review explains the intuitions underlying these methods, summarizes their applications, and categorizes the hypothesis tests they use in the trade-off between generality and specificity for SVG detection. We discuss challenges in SVG detection and propose future directions for improvement. Our review offers insights for method developers and users, advocating for category-specific benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClassContrast: Bridging the Spatial and Contextual Gaps for Node Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02158v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have revolutionized the domain of graph representation learning by utilizing neighborhood aggregation schemes in many popular architectures, such as message passing graph neural networks (MPGNNs). This scheme involves iteratively calculating a node's representation vector by aggregating and transforming the representation vectors of its adjacent nodes. Despite their effectiveness, MPGNNs face significant issues, such as oversquashing, oversmoothing, and underreaching, which hamper their effectiveness. Additionally, the reliance of MPGNNs on the homophily assumption, where edges typically connect nodes with similar labels and features, limits their performance in heterophilic contexts, where connected nodes often have significant differences. This necessitates the development of models that can operate effectively in both homophilic and heterophilic settings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, ClassContrast, grounded in Energy Landscape Theory from Chemical Physics, to overcome these limitations. ClassContrast combines spatial and contextual information, leveraging a physics-inspired energy landscape to model node embeddings that are both discriminative and robust across homophilic and heterophilic settings. Our approach introduces contrast-based homophily matrices to enhance the understanding of class interactions and tendencies. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ClassContrast outperforms traditional GNNs in node classification and link prediction tasks, proving its effectiveness and versatility in diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Engagement Measurement Based on Facial Landmarks and Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17175v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engagement in virtual learning is crucial for a variety of factors including student satisfaction, performance, and compliance with learning programs, but measuring it is a challenging task. There is therefore considerable interest in utilizing artificial intelligence and affective computing to measure engagement in natural settings as well as on a large scale. This paper introduces a novel, privacy-preserving method for engagement measurement from videos. It uses facial landmarks, which carry no personally identifiable information, extracted from videos via the MediaPipe deep learning solution. The extracted facial landmarks are fed to Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) to output the engagement level of the student in the video. To integrate the ordinal nature of the engagement variable into the training process, ST-GCNs undergo training in a novel ordinal learning framework based on transfer learning. Experimental results on two video student engagement measurement datasets show the superiority of the proposed method compared to previous methods with improved state-of-the-art on the EngageNet dataset with a 3.1% improvement in four-class engagement level classification accuracy and on the Online Student Engagement dataset with a 1.5% improvement in binary engagement classification accuracy. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to the developed ST-GCNs to interpret the engagement measurements obtained by the proposed method in both the spatial and temporal domains. The relatively lightweight and fast ST-GCN and its integration with the real-time MediaPipe make the proposed approach capable of being deployed on virtual learning platforms and measuring engagement in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Polynomial growth in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11880v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we study a version of (non-Markovian) first passage percolation on graphs, where the transmission time between two connected vertices is non-iid, but increases by a penalty factor polynomial in their expected degrees. Based on the exponent of the penalty-polynomial, this makes it increasingly harder to transmit to and from high-degree vertices. This choice is motivated by awareness or time-limitations. For the iid part of the transmission times we allow any nonnegative distribution with regularly varying behaviour at $0$. For the underlying graph models we choose spatial random graphs that have power-law degree distributions, so that the effect of the penalisation becomes visible: (finite and infinite) Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees. We prove that upon increasing the penalty exponent, the transmission time between two far away vertices $x,y$ sweeps through four universal phases even for a single underlying graph: explosive (tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but sublinear ($|x-y|^{\eta_0+o(1)}$ for an explicit $\eta_0<1$), and linear ($\Theta(|x-y|)$) in their Euclidean distance. Further, none of these phases are restricted to phase boundaries, and those are non-trivial in the main model parameters: the tail of the degree-distribution, a long-range parameter, and the exponent of regular variation of the iid part of the transmission times. In this paper we present proofs of lower bounds for the latter two phases and the upper bound for the linear phase. These complement the matching upper bounds for the polynomial regime in our companion paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages.

| **[GravMAD: Grounded Spatial Value Maps Guided Action Diffusion for Generalized 3D Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20154v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots' ability to follow language instructions and execute diverse 3D tasks is vital in robot learning. Traditional imitation learning-based methods perform well on seen tasks but struggle with novel, unseen ones due to variability. Recent approaches leverage large foundation models to assist in understanding novel tasks, thereby mitigating this issue. However, these methods lack a task-specific learning process, which is essential for an accurate understanding of 3D environments, often leading to execution failures. In this paper, we introduce GravMAD, a sub-goal-driven, language-conditioned action diffusion framework that combines the strengths of imitation learning and foundation models. Our approach breaks tasks into sub-goals based on language instructions, allowing auxiliary guidance during both training and inference. During training, we introduce Sub-goal Keypose Discovery to identify key sub-goals from demonstrations. Inference differs from training, as there are no demonstrations available, so we use pre-trained foundation models to bridge the gap and identify sub-goals for the current task. In both phases, GravMaps are generated from sub-goals, providing flexible 3D spatial guidance compared to fixed 3D positions. Empirical evaluations on RLBench show that GravMAD significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with a 28.63% improvement on novel tasks and a 13.36% gain on tasks encountered during training. These results demonstrate GravMAD's strong multi-task learning and generalization in 3D manipulation. Video demonstrations are available at: https://gravmad.github.io.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Addressing Spatial Confounding in geostatistical regression models: An R-INLA approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01530v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>1 - Spatial confounding is a phenomenon that has been studied extensively in recent years in the statistical literature to describe and mitigate apparent inconsistencies between the results obtained by regression models with and without random spatial effects. While the most common solutions target almost exclusively areal data or geostatistical data modelling by splines, we aim to extend some resolution methods in the context of geostatistical data modelling by Gaussian Markov Random Fields (GMRF) using R-INLA methodology. 2 - First, we present three approaches for alleviating spatial confounding: Restricted Spatial Regression (RSR), Spatial+, and its recent simplified version, called here Spatial+ 2.0. We show how each can be implemented from geostatistical data in a GMRF framework using R-inlabru. 3 - Next, a simulation study that reproduces a spatial confounding phenomenon is carried out to assess the coherence of the extensions with the expectations of these methods. Finally, we apply the expanded methods to a case study, linking cadmium (Cd) concentration in terrestrial mosses to Cd concentration in air. 4 - Our findings support the feasibility of our extended approach of spatial confounding resolution methods to geostatistical data using R-INLA in keeping with the previous contexts, although certain precautions and limitations must be considered.</p></details> | 39 pages, 5 figures |
| **[WEEP: A method for spatial interpretation of weakly supervised CNN models in computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15238v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning enables the modelling of high-resolution histopathology whole-slide images (WSI). Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Narrowing your FOV with SOLiD: Spatially Organized and Lightweight Global Descriptor for FOV-constrained LiDAR Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07330v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We often encounter limited FOV situations due to various factors such as sensor fusion or sensor mount in real-world robot navigation. However, the limited FOV interrupts the generation of descriptions and impacts place recognition adversely. Therefore, we suffer from correcting accumulated drift errors in a consistent map using LiDAR-based place recognition with limited FOV. Thus, in this paper, we propose a robust LiDAR-based place recognition method for handling narrow FOV scenarios. The proposed method establishes spatial organization based on the range-elevation bin and azimuth-elevation bin to represent places. In addition, we achieve a robust place description through reweighting based on vertical direction information. Based on these representations, our method enables addressing rotational changes and determining the initial heading. Additionally, we designed a lightweight and fast approach for the robot's onboard autonomy. For rigorous validation, the proposed method was tested across various LiDAR place recognition scenarios (i.e., single-session, multi-session, and multi-robot scenarios). To the best of our knowledge, we report the first method to cope with the restricted FOV. Our place description and SLAM codes will be released. Also, the supplementary materials of our descriptor are available at \texttt{\url{https://sites.google.com/view/lidar-solid}}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (2024)</p></details> |
| **[RS-FME-SwinT: A Novel Feature Map Enhancement Framework Integrating Customized SwinT with Residual and Spatial CNN for Monkeypox Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01216v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monkeypox (MPox) has emerged as a significant global concern, with cases steadily increasing daily. Conventional detection methods, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and manual examination, exhibit challenges of low sensitivity, high cost, and substantial workload. Therefore, deep learning offers an automated solution; however, the datasets include data scarcity, texture, contrast, inter-intra class variability, and similarities with other skin infectious diseases. In this regard, a novel hybrid approach is proposed that integrates the learning capacity of Residual Learning and Spatial Exploitation Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a customized Swin Transformer (RS-FME-SwinT) to capture multi-scale global and local correlated features for MPox diagnosis. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT technique employs a transfer learning-based feature map enhancement (FME) technique, integrating the customized SwinT for global information capture, residual blocks for texture extraction, and spatial blocks for local contrast variations. Moreover, incorporating new inverse residual blocks within the proposed SwinT effectively captures local patterns and mitigates vanishing gradients. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT has strong learning potential of diverse features that systematically reduce intra-class MPox variation and enable precise discrimination from other skin diseases. Finally, the proposed RS-FME-SwinT is a holdout cross-validated on a diverse MPox dataset and achieved outperformance on state-of-the-art CNNs and ViTs. The proposed RS-FME-SwinT demonstrates commendable results of an accuracy of 97.80%, sensitivity of 96.82%, precision of 98.06%, and an F-score of 97.44% in MPox detection. The RS-FME-SwinT could be a valuable tool for healthcare practitioners, enabling prompt and accurate MPox diagnosis and contributing significantly to mitigation efforts.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 Pa...</summary><p>37 Pages, 5 Tables, 10 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Visibility and Temporal Dynamics: Revolutionizing Field of View Prediction in Adaptive Point Cloud Video Streaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18236v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Field-of-View (FoV) adaptive streaming significantly reduces bandwidth requirement of immersive point cloud video (PCV) by only transmitting visible points in a viewer's FoV. The traditional approaches often focus on trajectory-based 6 degree-of-freedom (6DoF) FoV predictions. The predicted FoV is then used to calculate point visibility. Such approaches do not explicitly consider video content's impact on viewer attention, and the conversion from FoV to point visibility is often error-prone and time-consuming. We reformulate the PCV FoV prediction problem from the cell visibility perspective, allowing for precise decision-making regarding the transmission of 3D data at the cell level based on the predicted visibility distribution. We develop a novel spatial visibility and object-aware graph model that leverages the historical 3D visibility data and incorporates spatial perception, neighboring cell correlation, and occlusion information to predict the cell visibility in the future. Our model significantly improves the long-term cell visibility prediction, reducing the prediction MSE loss by up to 50% compared to the state-of-the-art models while maintaining real-time performance (more than 30fps) for point cloud videos with over 1 million points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial Context: A Comprehensive Bibliography of GWR and MGWR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16209v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local spatial models such as Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) and Multiscale Geographically Weighted Regression (MGWR) serve as instrumental tools to capture intrinsic contextual effects through the estimates of the local intercepts and behavioral contextual effects through estimates of the local slope parameters. GWR and MGWR provide simple implementation yet powerful frameworks that could be extended to various disciplines that handle spatial data. This bibliography aims to serve as a comprehensive compilation of peer-reviewed papers that have utilized GWR or MGWR as a primary analytical method to conduct spatial analyses and acts as a useful guide to anyone searching the literature for previous examples of local statistical modeling in a wide variety of application fields.</p></details> | 423 pages |
| **[Spatial Action Unit Cues for Interpretable Deep Facial Expression Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01848v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although state-of-the-art classifiers for facial expression recognition (FER) can achieve a high level of accuracy, they lack interpretability, an important feature for end-users. Experts typically associate spatial action units (AUs) from a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions. In this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy is proposed to explicitly incorporate AU cues into classifier training, allowing to train deep interpretable models. During training, this AU codebook is used, along with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to construct a AU heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interest w.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train a deep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining the spatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with AU heatmaps. Using a composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify an image while yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with AU maps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies on image class expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations. Our new strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- or transformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change or significant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two public benchmarks RAF-DB, and AffectNet datasets shows that our proposed strategy can improve layer-wise interpretability without degrading classification performance. In addition, we explore a common type of interpretable classifiers that rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods, and show that our approach can also improve CAM interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, AI and Digital Health Symposium 2024, October 18th 2024, Montr\'eal</p></details> |
| **[Robust Traffic Forecasting against Spatial Shift over Years](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00373v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) and Transformers have demonstrated promising potential for traffic forecasting by effectively capturing both temporal and spatial correlations. The generalization ability of spatiotemporal models has received considerable attention in recent scholarly discourse. However, no substantive datasets specifically addressing traffic out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios have been proposed. Existing ST-OOD methods are either constrained to testing on extant data or necessitate manual modifications to the dataset. Consequently, the generalization capacity of current spatiotemporal models in OOD scenarios remains largely underexplored. In this paper, we investigate state-of-the-art models using newly proposed traffic OOD benchmarks and, surprisingly, find that these models experience a significant decline in performance. Through meticulous analysis, we attribute this decline to the models' inability to adapt to previously unobserved spatial relationships. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, which learns a set of graph generators (i.e., graphons) during training and adaptively combines them to generate new graphs based on novel environmental conditions to handle spatial distribution shifts during testing. We further extend this concept to the Transformer architecture, achieving substantial improvements. Our method is both parsimonious and efficacious, and can be seamlessly integrated into any spatiotemporal model, outperforming current state-of-the-art approaches in addressing spatial dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast spatial simulation of extreme high-resolution radar precipitation data using INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11390v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aiming to deliver improved precipitation simulations for hydrological impact assessment studies, we develop a methodology for modelling and simulating high-dimensional spatial precipitation extremes, focusing on both their marginal distributions and tail dependence structures. Tail dependence is crucial for assessing the consequences of extreme precipitation events, yet most stochastic weather generators do not attempt to capture this property. The spatial distribution of precipitation occurrences is modelled with four competing models, while the spatial distribution of nonzero extreme precipitation intensities are modelled with a latent Gaussian version of the spatial conditional extremes model. Nonzero precipitation marginal distributions are modelled using latent Gaussian models with gamma and generalised Pareto likelihoods. Fast inference is achieved using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA). We model and simulate spatial precipitation extremes in Central Norway, using 13 years of hourly radar data with a spatial resolution of $1 \times 1$~km$^2$, over an area of size $6461$~km$^2$, to describe the behaviour of extreme precipitation over a small drainage area. Inference on this high-dimensional data set is achieved within hours, and the simulations capture the main trends of the observed precipitation well.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoINSTA: Zero-shot Long Video Understanding via Informative Spatial-Temporal Reasoning with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20365v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the video-language domain, recent works in leveraging zero-shot Large Language Model-based reasoning for video understanding have become competitive challengers to previous end-to-end models. However, long video understanding presents unique challenges due to the complexity of reasoning over extended timespans, even for zero-shot LLM-based approaches. The challenge of information redundancy in long videos prompts the question of what specific information is essential for large language models (LLMs) and how to leverage them for complex spatial-temporal reasoning in long-form video analysis. We propose a framework VideoINSTA, i.e. INformative Spatial-TemporAl Reasoning for zero-shot long-form video understanding. VideoINSTA contributes (1) a zero-shot framework for long video understanding using LLMs; (2) an event-based temporal reasoning and content-based spatial reasoning approach for LLMs to reason over spatial-temporal information in videos; (3) a self-reflective information reasoning scheme balancing temporal factors based on information sufficiency and prediction confidence. Our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art on three long video question-answering benchmarks: EgoSchema, NextQA, and IntentQA, and the open question answering dataset ActivityNetQA.

| **[TSdetector: Temporal-Spatial Self-correction Collaborative Learning for Colonoscopy Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19983v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CNN-based object detection models that strike a balance between performance and speed have been gradually used in polyp detection tasks. Nevertheless, accurately locating polyps within complex colonoscopy video scenes remains challenging since existing methods ignore two key issues: intra-sequence distribution heterogeneity and precision-confidence discrepancy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Temporal-Spatial self-correction detector (TSdetector), which first integrates temporal-level consistency learning and spatial-level reliability learning to detect objects continuously. Technically, we first propose a global temporal-aware convolution, assembling the preceding information to dynamically guide the current convolution kernel to focus on global features between sequences. In addition, we designed a hierarchical queue integration mechanism to combine multi-temporal features through a progressive accumulation manner, fully leveraging contextual consistency information together with retaining long-sequence-dependency features. Meanwhile, at the spatial level, we advance a position-aware clustering to explore the spatial relationships among candidate boxes for recalibrating prediction confidence adaptively, thus eliminating redundant bounding boxes efficiently. The experimental results on three publicly available polyp video dataset show that TSdetector achieves the highest polyp detection rate and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. The code can be available at https://github.com/soleilssss/TSdetector.</p></details> |  |
| **[MCU-Net: A Multi-prior Collaborative Deep Unfolding Network with Gates-controlled Spatial Attention for Accelerated MR Image Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03383v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep unfolding networks (DUNs) have demonstrated significant potential in accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, they often encounter high computational costs and slow convergence rates. Besides, they struggle to fully exploit the complementarity when incorporating multiple priors. In this study, we propose a multi-prior collaborative DUN, termed MCU-Net, to address these limitations. Our method features a parallel structure consisting of different optimization-inspired subnetworks based on low-rank and sparsity, respectively. We design a gates-controlled spatial attention module (GSAM), evaluating the relative confidence (RC) and overall confidence (OC) maps for intermediate reconstructions produced by different subnetworks. RC allocates greater weights to the image regions where each subnetwork excels, enabling precise element-wise collaboration. We design correction modules to enhance the effectiveness in regions where both subnetworks exhibit limited performance, as indicated by low OC values, thereby obviating the need for additional branches. The gate units within GSAMs are designed to preserve necessary information across multiple iterations, improving the accuracy of the learned confidence maps and enhancing robustness against accumulated errors. Experimental results on multiple datasets show significant improvements on PSNR and SSIM results with relatively low FLOPs compared to cutting-edge methods. Additionally, the proposed strategy can be conveniently applied to various DUN structures to enhance their performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWIM: Short-Window CNN Integrated with Mamba for EEG-Based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19884v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex auditory environments, the human auditory system possesses the remarkable ability to focus on a specific speaker while disregarding others. In this study, a new model named SWIM, a short-window convolution neural network (CNN) integrated with Mamba, is proposed for identifying the locus of auditory attention (left or right) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals without relying on speech envelopes. SWIM consists of two parts. The first is a short-window CNN (SW$_\text{CNN}$), which acts as a short-term EEG feature extractor and achieves a final accuracy of 84.9% in the leave-one-speaker-out setup on the widely used KUL dataset. This improvement is due to the use of an improved CNN structure, data augmentation, multitask training, and model combination. The second part, Mamba, is a sequence model first applied to auditory spatial attention decoding to leverage the long-term dependency from previous SW$_\text{CNN}$ time steps. By joint training SW$_\text{CNN}$ and Mamba, the proposed SWIM structure uses both short-term and long-term information and achieves an accuracy of 86.2%, which reduces the classification errors by a relative 31.0% compared to the previous state-of-the-art result.

Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SATA: Spatial Autocorrelation Token Analysis for Enhancing the Robustness of Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19850v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, vision transformers (ViTs) have consistently demonstrated remarkable performance across various visual recognition tasks. However, attempts to enhance their robustness have yielded limited success, mainly focusing on different training strategies, input patch augmentation, or network structural enhancements. These approaches often involve extensive training and fine-tuning, which are time-consuming and resource-intensive. To tackle these obstacles, we introduce a novel approach named Spatial Autocorrelation Token Analysis (SATA). By harnessing spatial relationships between token features, SATA enhances both the representational capacity and robustness of ViT models. This is achieved through the analysis and grouping of tokens according to their spatial autocorrelation scores prior to their input into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) block of the self-attention mechanism. Importantly, SATA seamlessly integrates into existing pre-trained ViT baselines without requiring retraining or additional fine-tuning, while concurrently improving efficiency by reducing the computational load of the FFN units. Experimental results show that the baseline ViTs enhanced with SATA not only achieve a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K image classification (94.9%) but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across multiple robustness benchmarks, including ImageNet-A (top-1=63.6%), ImageNet-R (top-1=79.2%), and ImageNet-C (mCE=13.6%), all without requiring additional training or fine-tuning of baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19764v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present a compelling and energy-efficient alternative to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their sparse binary activation. Leveraging the success of the transformer architecture, the spiking transformer architecture is explored to scale up dataset size and performance. However, existing works only consider the spatial self-attention in spiking transformer, neglecting the inherent temporal context across the timesteps. In this work, we introduce Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture designed to integrate spatial and temporal information in self-attention with negligible additional computational load. The STAtten divides the temporal or token index and calculates the self-attention in a cross-manner to effectively incorporate spatial-temporal information. We first verify our spatial-temporal attention mechanism's ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies using sequential datasets. Moreover, we validate our approach through extensive experiments on varied datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101. Notably, our cross-attention mechanism achieves an accuracy of 78.39 % on the ImageNet dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[STTM: A New Approach Based Spatial-Temporal Transformer And Memory Network For Real-time Pressure Signal In On-demand Food Delivery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00057v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-demand Food Delivery (OFD) services have become very common around the world. For example, on the Ele.me platform, users place more than 15 million food orders every day. Predicting the Real-time Pressure Signal (RPS) is crucial for OFD services, as it is primarily used to measure the current status of pressure on the logistics system. When RPS rises, the pressure increases, and the platform needs to quickly take measures to prevent the logistics system from being overloaded. Usually, the average delivery time for all orders within a business district is used to represent RPS. Existing research on OFD services primarily focuses on predicting the delivery time of orders, while relatively less attention has been given to the study of the RPS. Previous research directly applies general models such as DeepFM, RNN, and GNN for prediction, but fails to adequately utilize the unique temporal and spatial characteristics of OFD services, and faces issues with insufficient sensitivity during sudden severe weather conditions or peak periods. To address these problems, this paper proposes a new method based on Spatio-Temporal Transformer and Memory Network (STTM). Specifically, we use a novel Spatio-Temporal Transformer structure to learn logistics features across temporal and spatial dimensions and encode the historical information of a business district and its neighbors, thereby learning both temporal and spatial information. Additionally, a Memory Network is employed to increase sensitivity to abnormal events. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that STTM significantly outperforms previous methods in both offline experiments and the online A/B test, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Reasoning and Planning for Deep Embodied Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19479v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can perform complex tasks with long-term objectives by planning, reasoning, and forecasting outcomes of actions. For embodied agents to achieve similar capabilities, they must gain knowledge of the environment transferable to novel scenarios with a limited budget of additional trial and error. Learning-based approaches, such as deep RL, can discover and take advantage of inherent regularities and characteristics of the application domain from data, and continuously improve their performances, however at a cost of large amounts of training data. This thesis explores the development of data-driven techniques for spatial reasoning and planning tasks, focusing on enhancing learning efficiency, interpretability, and transferability across novel scenarios. Four key contributions are made. 1) CALVIN, a differential planner that learns interpretable models of the world for long-term planning. It successfully navigated partially observable 3D environments, such as mazes and indoor rooms, by learning the rewards and state transitions from expert demonstrations. 2) SOAP, an RL algorithm that discovers options unsupervised for long-horizon tasks. Options segment a task into subtasks and enable consistent execution of the subtask. SOAP showed robust performances on history-conditional corridor tasks as well as classical benchmarks such as Atari. 3) LangProp, a code optimisation framework using LLMs to solve embodied agent problems that require reasoning by treating code as learnable policies. The framework successfully generated interpretable code with comparable or superior performance to human-written experts in the CARLA autonomous driving benchmark. 4) Voggite, an embodied agent with a vision-to-action transformer backend that solves complex tasks in Minecraft. It achieved third place in the MineRL BASALT Competition by identifying action triggers to segment tasks into multiple stages.</p></details> | <details><summary>DPhil...</summary><p>DPhil Thesis - Engineering Science, University of Oxford.

| **[Learning non-Gaussian spatial distributions via Bayesian transport maps with parametric shrinkage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19208v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications, including climate-model analysis and stochastic weather generators, require learning or emulating the distribution of a high-dimensional and non-Gaussian spatial field based on relatively few training samples. To address this challenge, a recently proposed Bayesian transport map (BTM) approach consists of a triangular transport map with nonparametric Gaussian-process (GP) components, which is trained to transform the distribution of interest distribution to a Gaussian reference distribution. To improve the performance of this existing BTM, we propose to shrink the map components toward a ``base'' parametric Gaussian family combined with a Vecchia approximation for scalability. The resulting ShrinkTM approach is more accurate than the existing BTM, especially for small numbers of training samples. It can even outperform the ``base'' family when trained on a single sample of the spatial field. We demonstrate the advantage of ShrinkTM though numerical experiments on simulated data and on climate-model output.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching Robots Where To Go And How To Act With Human Sketches via Spatial Diagrammatic Instructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12465v3)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Spatial Diagrammatic Instructions (SDIs), an approach for human operators to specify objectives and constraints that are related to spatial regions in the working environment. Human operators are enabled to sketch out regions directly on camera images that correspond to the objectives and constraints. These sketches are projected to 3D spatial coordinates, and continuous Spatial Instruction Maps (SIMs) are learned upon them. These maps can then be integrated into optimization problems for tasks of robots. In particular, we demonstrate how Spatial Diagrammatic Instructions can be applied to solve the Base Placement Problem of mobile manipulators, which concerns the best place to put the manipulator to facilitate a certain task. Human operators can specify, via sketch, spatial regions of interest for a manipulation task and permissible regions for the mobile manipulator to be at. Then, an optimization problem that maximizes the manipulator's reachability, or coverage, over the designated regions of interest while remaining in the permissible regions is solved. We provide extensive empirical evaluations, and show that our formulation of Spatial Instruction Maps provides accurate representations of user-specified diagrammatic instructions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our diagrammatic approach to the Mobile Base Placement Problem enables higher quality solutions and faster runtime.</p></details> |  |

Although groundbreaking, it struggles with gene capture yielding high corruption in acquired data. Given potential applications, recent efforts have focused on predicting transcriptomic profiles solely from histology images. However, differences in databases, preprocessing techniques, and training hyperparameters hinder a fair comparison between methods. To address these challenges, we present a systematically curated and processed database collected from 26 public sources, representing an 8.6-fold increase compared to previous works. Additionally, we propose a state-of-the-art transformer based completion technique for inferring missing gene expression, which significantly boosts the performance of transcriptomic profile predictions across all datasets. Altogether, our contributions constitute the most comprehensive benchmark of gene expression prediction from histology images to date and a stepping stone for future research on spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Characterization of Near-Surface Velocity Structure(s) in the San Francisco Bay Area: A Stationary and Spatially Varying Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18856v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the development of two new sedimentary velocity models for the San Francisco Bay Area (SFBA) to improve the near-surface characterization of shear-wave velocity ($V_S$), with the ultimate goal of enhancing the Bay Area community velocity model. A stationary model, based solely on $V_{S30}$, and a spatially varying model incorporating location-specific adjustments were developed using a dataset of 200 measured $V_S$ profiles. Both models were formulated within a hierarchical Bayesian framework, using a parameterization that ensures robust scaling. The spatially varying model includes a slope adjustment term modeled as a Gaussian process to capture site-specific effects based on location. Residual analysis shows that both models are unbiased up to $V_S$ values of 1000 m/sec. Along-depth variability models were also developed using within-profile residuals. Applying the proposed models in the SFBA results in an increase in $V_S$ in the San Jose area and east of the Hayward Fault, supporting simulations that suggest over-amplification in these regions compared to observations. Goodness-of-fit (GOF) comparisons using linear site-response analyses demonstrate that the proposed models outperform the USGS model in capturing near-surface amplification across a broad frequency range. Incorporating along-depth variability further improves GOF scores by reducing over-amplification at high frequencies. These results underscore the importance of integrating community velocity models with detailed sedimentary velocity models to enhance regional seismic hazard assessments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript: 18 pages, 12 figures.

| **[A Generalized Tensor Formulation for Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution Under General Spatial Blurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18731v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral super-resolution is commonly accomplished by the fusing of a hyperspectral imaging of low spatial resolution with a multispectral image of high spatial resolution, and many tensor-based approaches to this task have been recently proposed. Yet, it is assumed in such tensor-based methods that the spatial-blurring operation that creates the observed hyperspectral image from the desired super-resolved image is separable into independent horizontal and vertical blurring. Recent work has argued that such separable spatial degradation is ill-equipped to model the operation of real sensors which may exhibit, for example, anisotropic blurring. To accommodate this fact, a generalized tensor formulation based on a Kronecker decomposition is proposed to handle any general spatial-degradation matrix, including those that are not separable as previously assumed. Analysis of the generalized formulation reveals conditions under which exact recovery of the desired super-resolved image is guaranteed, and a practical algorithm for such recovery, driven by a blockwise-group-sparsity regularization, is proposed. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed generalized tensor approach outperforms not only traditional matrix-based techniques but also state-of-the-art tensor-based methods; the gains with respect to the latter are especially significant in cases of anisotropic spatial blurring.</p></details> |  |
| **[An interpretable and transferable model for shallow landslides detachment combining spatial Poisson point processes and generalized additive models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18672v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Less than 10 meters deep, shallow landslides are rapidly moving and strongly dangerous slides. In the present work, the probabilistic distribution of the landslide detachment points within a valley is modelled as a spatial Poisson point process, whose intensity depends on geophysical predictors according to a generalized additive model. Modelling the intensity with a generalized additive model jointly allows to obtain good predictive performance and to preserve the interpretability of the effects of the geophysical predictors on the intensity of the process. We propose a novel workflow, based on Random Forests, to select the geophysical predictors entering the model for the intensity. In this context, the statistically significant effects are interpreted as activating or stabilizing factors for landslide detachment. In order to guarantee the transferability of the resulting model, training, validation, and test of the algorithm are performed on mutually disjoint valleys in the Alps of Lombardy (Italy). Finally, the uncertainty around the estimated intensity of the process is quantified via semiparametric bootstrap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v4)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |

Our contributions are: (a) we dissociate random cropping into two separate augmentations, overlap and patch, and provide a detailed analysis on the effect of area of overlap and patch size to the accuracy on down stream tasks. (b) We offer an insight into why cutout augmentation does not learn good representation, as reported in earlier literature. Finally, based on these analysis, (c) we propose a distance-based margin to the invariance loss for learning scene-centric representations for the downstream task on object-centric distribution, showing that as simple as a margin proportional to the pixel distance between the two spatial views in the scence-centric images can improve the learned representation. Our study furthers the understanding of the spatial augmentations, and the effect of the domain-gap between the training augmentations and the test distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ECCV 2024 Workshop on Out-of-distribution generalization in computer vision (OOD-CV)</p></details> |

However, previous works primarily relied on a single masking criterion, resulting in the model overfitting specific features and overlooking other effective information. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchy and attention guided cross-masking framework (HA-CM) that applies masking to skeleton sequences from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, in spatial graphs, we utilize hyperbolic space to maintain joint distinctions and effectively preserve the hierarchical structure of high-dimensional skeletons, employing joint hierarchy as the masking criterion. In temporal flows, we substitute traditional distance metrics with the global attention of joints for masking, addressing the convergence of distances in high-dimensional space and the lack of a global perspective. Additionally, we incorporate cross-contrast loss based on the cross-masking framework into the loss function to enhance the model's learning of instance-level features. HA-CM shows efficiency and universality on three public large-scale datasets, NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD. The source code of our HA-CM is available at https://github.com/YinxPeng/HA-CM-main.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages,6 figures,IEEE Trans</p></details> |

Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Spatially embedded recurrent neural networks provide a promising avenue to study how modelled constraints shape the combined structural and functional organisation of networks over learning. Prior work has shown that spatially embedded systems like this can combine structure and function into single artificial models during learning. But it remains unclear precisely how, in general, structural constraints bound the range of attainable configurations. In this work, we show that it is possible to study these restrictions through entropic measures of the neural weights and eigenspectrum, across both rate and spiking neural networks. Spatial embedding, in contrast to baseline models, leads to networks with a highly specific low entropy modularity where connectivity is readily interpretable given the known spatial and communication constraints acting on them. Crucially, these networks also demonstrate systematically modulated spectral dynamics, revealing how they exploit heterogeneity in their function to overcome the constraints imposed on their structure. This work deepens our understanding of constrained learning in neural networks, across coding schemes and tasks, where solutions to simultaneous structural and functional objectives must be accomplished in tandem.</p></details> | 19 pages, 5 figures |

Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, with a $26.6\%$ decrease of FID on HumanML3D and a $29.9\%$ decrease on KIT-ML.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Spectral estimation for spatial point processes and random fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10176v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial variables can be observed in many different forms, such as regularly sampled random fields (lattice data), point processes, and randomly sampled spatial processes. Joint analysis of such collections of observations is clearly desirable, but complicated by the lack of an easily implementable analysis framework. It is well known that Fourier transforms provide such a framework, but its form has eluded data analysts. We formalize it by providing a multitaper analysis framework using coupled discrete and continuous data tapers, combined with the discrete Fourier transform for inference. Using this set of tools is important, as it forms the backbone for practical spectral analysis. In higher dimensions it is important not to be constrained to Cartesian product domains, and so we develop the methodology for spectral analysis using irregular domain data tapers, and the tapered discrete Fourier transform. We discuss its fast implementation, and the asymptotic as well as large finite domain properties. Estimators of partial association between different spatial processes are provided as are principled methods to determine their significance, and we demonstrate their practical utility on a large-scale ecological dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bivariate DeepKriging for Large-scale Spatial Interpolation of Wind Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08038v2)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High spatial resolution wind data are essential for a wide range of applications in climate, oceanographic and meteorological studies. Large-scale spatial interpolation or downscaling of bivariate wind fields having velocity in two dimensions is a challenging task because wind data tend to be non-Gaussian with high spatial variability and heterogeneity. In spatial statistics, cokriging is commonly used for predicting bivariate spatial fields. However, the cokriging predictor is not optimal except for Gaussian processes. Additionally, cokriging is computationally prohibitive for large datasets. In this paper, we propose a method, called bivariate DeepKriging, which is a spatially dependent deep neural network (DNN) with an embedding layer constructed by spatial radial basis functions for bivariate spatial data prediction. We then develop a distribution-free uncertainty quantification method based on bootstrap and ensemble DNN. Our proposed approach outperforms the traditional cokriging predictor with commonly used covariance functions, such as the linear model of co-regionalization and flexible bivariate Mat\'ern covariance. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of the proposed DNN model, with computations that are, on average, 20 times faster than those of conventional techniques. We apply the bivariate DeepKriging method to the wind data over the Middle East region at 506,771 locations. The prediction performance of the proposed method is superior over the cokriging predictors and dramatically reduces computation time.</p></details> |  |

As increasing numbers of actuators are required to adequately convey information in complicated applications, haptic designers find it difficult to create such systems due to limited scalability of existing toolkits. We propose VibraForge, an open-source vibrotactile toolkit that supports up to 128 vibrotactile actuators. Each actuator is encapsulated within a self-contained vibration unit and driven by its own microcontroller. By leveraging a chain-connection method, each unit receives independent vibration commands from a control unit, with fine-grained control over intensity and frequency. We also designed a GUI Editor to expedite the authoring of spatial vibrotactile patterns. Technical evaluations show that vibration units reliably reproduce audio waveforms with low-latency and high-bandwidth data communication. Case studies of phonemic tactile display, virtual reality fitness training, and drone teleoperation demonstrate the potential usage of VibraForge within different domains.</p></details> |  |

This condition has caused significant economic losses as high as $200 million annually, and the root cause of WB has yet to be identified. Human palpation is the most common method of distinguishing a WB from others. However, this method is time-consuming and subjective. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) combined with machine learning algorithms can evaluate the WB conditions of fillets in a non-invasive, objective, and high-throughput manner. In this study, 250 raw chicken breast fillet samples (normal, mild, severe) were taken, and spatially heterogeneous hardness distribution was first considered when designing HSI processing models. The study not only classified the WB levels from HSI but also built a regression model to correlate the spectral information with sample hardness data. To achieve a satisfactory classification and regression model, a neural network architecture search (NAS) enabled a wide-deep neural network model named NAS-WD, which was developed. In NAS-WD, NAS was first used to automatically optimize the network architecture and hyperparameters. The classification results show that NAS-WD can classify the three WB levels with an overall accuracy of 95%, outperforming the traditional machine learning model, and the regression correlation between the spectral data and hardness was 0.75, which performs significantly better than traditional regression models.</p></details> |  |

But can VLMs learn novel concepts purely from visual demonstrations, or are they limited to adapting to the output format of ICL examples? We propose a new benchmark we call Spatial Visual Ambiguity Tasks (SVAT) that challenges state-of-the-art VLMs to learn new visuospatial tasks in-context. We find that VLMs fail to do this zero-shot, and sometimes continue to fail after finetuning. However, adding simpler data to the training by curriculum learning leads to improved ICL performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures.

Historically, modular speaker diarization methods have seldom discussed how to leverage spatial cues from multi-channel speech. This paper proposes a three-stage modular system to enhance single-channel neural speaker diarization systems and recognition performance by utilizing spatial cues from multi-channel speech to provide more accurate initialization for each stage of neural speaker diarization (NSD) decoding: (1) Overlap detection and continuous speech separation (CSS) on multi-channel speech are used to obtain cleaner single speaker speech segments for clustering, followed by the first NSD decoding pass. (2) The results from the first pass initialize a complex Angular Central Gaussian Mixture Model (cACGMM) to estimate speaker-wise masks on multi-channel speech, and through Overlap-add and Mask-to-VAD, achieve initialization with lower speaker error (SpkErr), followed by the second NSD decoding pass. (3) The second decoding results are used for guided source separation (GSS), recognizing and filtering short segments containing less one word to obtain cleaner speech segments, followed by re-clustering and the final NSD decoding pass. We presented the progressively explored evaluation results from the CHiME-8 NOTSOFAR-1 (Natural Office Talkers in Settings Of Far-field Audio Recordings) challenge, demonstrating the effectiveness of our system and its contribution to improving recognition performance. Our final system achieved the first place in the challenge.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

While Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) methods in deep learning have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting road conditions when sufficient data is available, forecasting in road networks with limited data remains a challenging task. This study proposed a novel Spatial-temporal Convolutional Network (TL-GPSTGN) based on graph pruning and transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Firstly, the essential structure and information of the graph are extracted by analyzing the correlation and information entropy of the road network structure and feature data. By utilizing graph pruning techniques, the adjacency matrix of the graph and the input feature data are processed, resulting in a significant improvement in the model's migration performance. Subsequently, the well-characterized data are inputted into the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network to capture the spatial-temporal relationships and make predictions regarding the road conditions. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive testing and validation of the TL-GPSTGN method on real datasets, comparing its prediction performance against other commonly used models under identical conditions. The results demonstrate the exceptional predictive accuracy of TL-GPSTGN on a single dataset, as well as its robust migration performance across different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by ICIAAI2023, withdrawn from proceedings</p></details> |

Spatial modelling of extreme values is no exception, with one of the most common such assumptions being stationarity in the marginal and/or dependence features. If non-stationarity has been detected in the marginal distributions, it is tempting to try to model this while assuming stationarity in the dependence, without necessarily putting this latter assumption through thorough testing. However, margins and dependence are often intricately connected and the detection of non-stationarity in one feature might affect the detection of non-stationarity in the other. This work is an in-depth case study of this interrelationship, with a particular focus on a spatio-temporal environmental application exhibiting well-documented marginal non-stationarity. Specifically, we compare and contrast four different marginal detrending approaches in terms of our post-detrending ability to detect temporal non-stationarity in the spatial extremal dependence structure of a sea surface temperature dataset from the Red Sea.</p></details> | 18 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MIMO: Controllable Character Video Synthesis with Spatial Decomposed Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16160v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Character video synthesis aims to produce realistic videos of animatable characters within lifelike scenes. As a fundamental problem in the computer vision and graphics community, 3D works typically require multi-view captures for per-case training, which severely limits their applicability of modeling arbitrary characters in a short time. Recent 2D methods break this limitation via pre-trained diffusion models, but they struggle for pose generality and scene interaction. To this end, we propose MIMO, a novel framework which can not only synthesize character videos with controllable attributes (i.e., character, motion and scene) provided by simple user inputs, but also simultaneously achieve advanced scalability to arbitrary characters, generality to novel 3D motions, and applicability to interactive real-world scenes in a unified framework. The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes, considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely, we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators, and decompose the video clip to three spatial components (i.e., main human, underlying scene, and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code, structured motion code and full scene code, which are utilized as control signals of synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control, complex motion expression, as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions. Experimental results demonstrate effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://menyifang.github.io/projects/MIMO/index.html</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Distillation on Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11798v4)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient real-time traffic prediction is crucial for reducing transportation time. To predict traffic conditions, we employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) to model our real-time traffic data as temporal graphs. Despite its capabilities, it often encounters challenges in delivering efficient real-time predictions for real-world traffic data. Recognizing the significance of timely prediction due to the dynamic nature of real-time data, we employ knowledge distillation (KD) as a solution to enhance the execution time of ST-GNNs for traffic prediction. In this paper, We introduce a cost function designed to train a network with fewer parameters (the student) using distilled data from a complex network (the teacher) while maintaining its accuracy close to that of the teacher. We use knowledge distillation, incorporating spatial-temporal correlations from the teacher network to enable the student to learn the complex patterns perceived by the teacher. However, a challenge arises in determining the student network architecture rather than considering it inadvertently. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the cost function to calculate pruning scores, addressing small network architecture search issues, and jointly fine-tunes the network resulting from each pruning stage using KD. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed ideas on two real-world datasets, PeMSD7 and PeMSD8. The results indicate that our method can maintain the student's accuracy close to that of the teacher, even with the retention of only 3% of network parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Mixture-of-Graph-Experts for Multi-Type Crime Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15764v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As various types of crime continue to threaten public safety and economic development, predicting the occurrence of multiple types of crimes becomes increasingly vital for effective prevention measures. Although extensive efforts have been made, most of them overlook the heterogeneity of different crime categories and fail to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Mixture-of-Graph-Experts (ST-MoGE) framework for collective multiple-type crime prediction. To enhance the model's ability to identify diverse spatial-temporal dependencies and mitigate potential conflicts caused by spatial-temporal heterogeneity of different crime categories, we introduce an attentive-gated Mixture-of-Graph-Experts (MGEs) module to capture the distinctive and shared crime patterns of each crime category. Then, we propose Cross-Expert Contrastive Learning(CECL) to update the MGEs and force each expert to focus on specific pattern modeling, thereby reducing blending and redundancy. Furthermore, to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Loss Re-weighting (HALR) approach to eliminate biases and insufficient learning of data-scarce regions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world crime datasets and compare our results with twelve advanced baselines. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lack of explicit and fixed spatial relationships in stock prediction tasks, many STGNNs fail to perform effectively in this domain. While some STGNNs learn spatial relationships from time series, they often lack comprehensiveness. Research indicates that modeling time series using feature changes as tokens reveals entirely different information compared to using time steps as tokens. To more comprehensively extract dynamic spatial information from stock data, we propose a Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer (DPA-STIFormer). DPA-STIFormer models each node via continuous changes in features as tokens and introduces a Double Direction Self-adaptation Fusion mechanism. This mechanism decomposes node encoding into temporal and feature representations, simultaneously extracting different spatial correlations from a double path approach, and proposes a Double-path gating mechanism to fuse these two types of correlation information. Experiments conducted on four stock market datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, validating the model's superior capability in uncovering latent temporal-correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |

We propose utilising graph representations to model sequences of local observations and the connectivity of the target location. Modelling as a graph enables generating previously unseen sequences by sampling with new parameter configurations. To leverage this newly available information, we propose a GNN-based architecture, producing spatially strong embeddings and improving discriminability over isolated image embeddings. We outline SpaGBOL, introducing three novel contributions. 1) The first graph-structured dataset for Cross-View Geo-Localisation, containing multiple streetview images per node to improve generalisation. 2) Introducing GNNs to the problem, we develop the first system that exploits the correlation between node proximity and feature similarity. 3) Leveraging the unique properties of the graph representation - we demonstrate a novel retrieval filtering approach based on neighbourhood bearings. SpaGBOL achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on the unseen test graph - with relative Top-1 retrieval improvements on previous techniques of 11%, and 50% when filtering with Bearing Vector Matching on the SpaGBOL dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, existing T2V models primarily focus on simple scenes featuring a single object performing a single motion. Challenges arise in scenarios involving multiple objects with distinct motions, often leading to incorrect video-text alignment between subjects and their corresponding motions. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{S$^2$AG-Vid}, a training-free inference-stage optimization method that improves the alignment of multiple objects with their corresponding motions in T2V models. S$^2$AG-Vid initially applies a spatial position-based, cross-attention (CA) constraint in the early stages of the denoising process, facilitating multiple nouns distinctly attending to the correct subject regions. To enhance the motion-subject binding, we implement a syntax-guided contrastive constraint in the subsequent denoising phase, aimed at improving the correlations between the CA maps of verbs and their corresponding nouns.Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline approaches, producing higher-quality videos with improved subject-motion consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[M2OST: Many-to-one Regression for Predicting Spatial Transcriptomics from Digital Pathology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15092v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) has facilitated the spatially-aware profiling of gene expressions based on histopathology images. Although ST data offers valuable insights into the micro-environment of tumors, its acquisition cost remains expensive. Therefore, directly predicting the ST expressions from digital pathology images is desired. Current methods usually adopt existing regression backbones along with patch-sampling for this task, which ignores the inherent multi-scale information embedded in the pyramidal data structure of digital pathology images, and wastes the inter-spot visual information crucial for accurate gene expression prediction. To address these limitations, we propose M2OST, a many-to-one regression Transformer that can accommodate the hierarchical structure of the pathology images via a decoupled multi-scale feature extractor. Unlike traditional models that are trained with one-to-one image-label pairs, M2OST uses multiple images from different levels of the digital pathology image to jointly predict the gene expressions in their common corresponding spot. Built upon our many-to-one scheme, M2OST can be easily scaled to fit different numbers of inputs, and its network structure inherently incorporates nearby inter-spot features, enhancing regression performance. We have tested M2OST on three public ST datasets and the experimental results show that M2OST can achieve state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and floating-point operations (FLOPs). The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Spatial Impulse Response Generation from Separate Room- and Scene-Specific Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14971v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For audio in augmented reality (AR), knowledge of the users' real acoustic environment is crucial for rendering virtual sounds that seamlessly blend into the environment. As acoustic measurements are usually not feasible in practical AR applications, information about the room needs to be inferred from available sound sources. Then, additional sound sources can be rendered with the same room acoustic qualities. Crucially, these are placed at different positions than the sources available for estimation. Here, we propose to use an encoder network trained using a contrastive loss that maps input sounds to a low-dimensional feature space representing only room-specific information. Then, a diffusion-based spatial room impulse response generator is trained to take the latent space and generate a new response, given a new source-receiver position. We show how both room- and position-specific parameters are considered in the final output.</p></details> |  |
| **[PSS-BA: LiDAR Bundle Adjustment with Progressive Spatial Smoothing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06124v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and consistent construction of point clouds from LiDAR scanning data is fundamental for 3D modeling applications. Current solutions, such as multiview point cloud registration and LiDAR bundle adjustment, predominantly depend on the local plane assumption, which may be inadequate in complex environments lacking of planar geometries or substantial initial pose errors. To mitigate this problem, this paper presents a LiDAR bundle adjustment with progressive spatial smoothing, which is suitable for complex environments and exhibits improved convergence capabilities. The proposed method consists of a spatial smoothing module and a pose adjustment module, which combines the benefits of local consistency and global accuracy. With the spatial smoothing module, we can obtain robust and rich surface constraints employing smoothing kernels across various scales. Then the pose adjustment module corrects all poses utilizing the novel surface constraints. Ultimately, the proposed method simultaneously achieves fine poses and parametric surfaces that can be directly employed for high-quality point cloud reconstruction. The effectiveness and robustness of our proposed approach have been validated on both simulation and real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods and achieves better accuracy in complex environments with low planar structures.</p></details> |  |

However, previous studies have not fully achieved this objective. In this paper, we propose ParvaGPU, a technology that facilitates spatial GPU sharing for large-scale DNN inference in cloud computing. ParvaGPU integrates NVIDIA's Multi-Instance GPU (MIG) and Multi-Process Service (MPS) technologies to enhance GPU utilization, with the goal of meeting the diverse SLOs of each workload and reducing overall GPU usage. Specifically, ParvaGPU addresses the challenges of minimizing underutilization within allocated GPU space partitions and external fragmentation in combined MIG and MPS environments. We conducted our assessment on multiple A100 GPUs, evaluating 11 diverse DNN workloads with varying SLOs. Our evaluation revealed no SLO violations and a significant reduction in GPU usage compared to state-of-the-art frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis (SC24)</p></details> |

The exploration of global dependency and complementary information across different modalities is essential for MCMR. However, existing methods either struggle to capture global dependency due to the limited receptive field or suffer from quadratic computational complexity. To tackle this dilemma, we propose a novel Frequency and Spatial Mutual Learning Network (FSMNet), which efficiently explores global dependencies across different modalities. Specifically, the features for each modality are extracted by the Frequency-Spatial Feature Extraction (FSFE) module, featuring a frequency branch and a spatial branch. Benefiting from the global property of the Fourier transform, the frequency branch can efficiently capture global dependency with an image-size receptive field, while the spatial branch can extract local features. To exploit complementary information from the auxiliary modality, we propose a Cross-Modal Selective fusion (CMS-fusion) module that selectively incorporate the frequency and spatial features from the auxiliary modality to enhance the corresponding branch of the target modality. To further integrate the enhanced global features from the frequency branch and the enhanced local features from the spatial branch, we develop a Frequency-Spatial fusion (FS-fusion) module, resulting in a comprehensive feature representation for the target modality. Extensive experiments on the BraTS and fastMRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed FSMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance for the MCMR task with different acceleration factors.

However, most existing methods are limited to highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios without discretization approximations. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving. The code for TSL reasoning is opened.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main text, 19 pages of technical appendix</p></details> |

We investigate the PCA of the sample spatial-sign covariance matrix in both nonsparse and sparse contexts, referring to them as SPCA and SSPCA, respectively. We present both nonasymptotic and asymptotic analyses to quantify the theoretical performance of SPCA and SSPCA. In sparse settings, we demonstrate that SSPCA, implemented through a combinatoric program, achieves the optimal rate of convergence. Our proposed SSPCA method is computationally efficient and exhibits robustness against heavy-tailed distributions compared to existing methods. Simulation studies and real-world data applications further validate the superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised manuscript has been submitted to the IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Inductive Spatial Temporal Prediction Under Data Drift with Informative Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13253v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive spatial temporal prediction can generalize historical data to predict unseen data, crucial for highly dynamic scenarios (e.g., traffic systems, stock markets). However, external events (e.g., urban structural growth, market crash) and emerging new entities (e.g., locations, stocks) can undermine prediction accuracy by inducing data drift over time. Most existing studies extract invariant patterns to counter data drift but ignore pattern diversity, exhibiting poor generalization to unseen entities. To address this issue, we design an Informative Graph Neural Network (INF-GNN) to distill diversified invariant patterns and improve prediction accuracy under data drift. Firstly, we build an informative subgraph with a uniquely designed metric, Relation Importance (RI), that can effectively select stable entities and distinct spatial relationships. This subgraph further generalizes new entities' data via neighbors merging. Secondly, we propose an informative temporal memory buffer to help the model emphasize valuable timestamps extracted using influence functions within time intervals. This memory buffer allows INF-GNN to discern influential temporal patterns. Finally, RI loss optimization is designed for pattern consolidation. Extensive experiments on real-world dataset under substantial data drift demonstrate that INF-GNN significantly outperforms existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |

Recently, graph neural networks based on K-nearest neighbor (KNN) graphs have gained prominence in spatial multi-modal omics methods due to their ability to model semantic relations between sequencing spots. However, the fixed KNN graph fails to capture the latent semantic relations hidden by the inevitable data perturbations during the biological sequencing process, resulting in the loss of semantic information. In addition, the common lack of spot annotation and class number priors in practice further hinders the optimization of spatial multi-modal omics models. Here, we propose a novel spatial multi-modal omics resolved framework, termed PRototype-Aware Graph Adaptative Aggregation for Spatial Multi-modal Omics Analysis (PRAGA). PRAGA constructs a dynamic graph to capture latent semantic relations and comprehensively integrate spatial information and feature semantics. The learnable graph structure can also denoise perturbations by learning cross-modal knowledge. Moreover, a dynamic prototype contrastive learning is proposed based on the dynamic adaptability of Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models to optimize the multi-modal omics representations for unknown biological priors. Quantitative and qualitative experiments on simulated and real datasets with 7 competing methods demonstrate the superior performance of PRAGA.</p></details> |  |

Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

Until recent years, numerous models had been proposed, ranging from classical algorithms like Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) to deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers.

By incorporating spatial and temporal Mamba encoders, STMambaNet effectively captures the intricate dynamics in both space and time, significantly enhancing the decoding performance of EEG signals for MI classification. Experimental results on BCI Competition IV 2a and 2b datasets demonstrate STMambaNet's superiority over existing models, establishing it as a powerful tool for advancing MI-based BCIs and improving real-world BCI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages,3 figures, accepted conference:ADMA2024</p></details> |

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unifying Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17360v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph learning is a fundamental problem in modern urban systems. Existing approaches tackle different tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs misalign with the current research efforts toward unifying spatio-temporal graph learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model these tasks in a unified probabilistic perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared dependencies. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly under the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising decoders that are task-specific. The encoder, optimized by pre-training strategies, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The decoders, utilizing attention mechanisms, generate predictions by leveraging learned patterns. Opting for forecasting and kriging, the decoders are designed as Spatial Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions. Combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic decoders, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both deterministic and probabilistic baselines, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

Our proposed method applies DETR to each frame and uses feature shift to incorporate temporal information. However, DETR's object queries in each frame may correspond to different objects, making a simple feature shift ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose query matching across different frames, ensuring that queries for the same object are matched and used for the feature shift. Experimental results show that performance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features are shifted using the proposed query matching.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions.

| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

| **[EventAug: Multifaceted Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentation Methods for Event-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11813v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |

Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework.

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |

However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field.

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with identifiable variational autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04162v1)** | 2024-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modelling multivariate spatio-temporal data with complex dependency structures is a challenging task but can be simplified by assuming that the original variables are generated from independent latent components. If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mending of Spatio-Temporal Dependencies in Block Adjacency Matrix](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02606v2)** | 2024-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of applications where data dynamically evolves across spatial and temporal dimensions, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are often complemented by sequence modeling architectures, such as RNNs and transformers, to effectively model temporal changes. These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Eigen-Cluster VIS: Improving Weakly-supervised Video Instance Segmentation by Leveraging Spatio-temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16661v1)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks. However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to simultaneously maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that formalize these complexities. We then contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

The recent advancements in Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have inspired efforts to reprogram these models for time series forecasting tasks, by leveraging their superior reasoning and generalization capabilities. However, existing approaches fall short in handling complex spatial inter-series dependencies and intrinsic intra-series frequency components, limiting their spatio-temporal forecasting performance. Moreover, the linear mapping of continuous time series to a compressed subset vocabulary in reprogramming constrains the spatio-temporal semantic expressivity of PLMs and may lead to potential information bottleneck. To overcome the above limitations, we propose \textsc{RePST}, a tailored PLM reprogramming framework for spatio-temporal forecasting. The key insight of \textsc{RePST} is to decouple the spatio-temporal dynamics in the frequency domain, allowing better alignment with the PLM text space. Specifically, we first decouple spatio-temporal data in Fourier space and devise a structural diffusion operator to obtain temporal intrinsic and spatial diffusion signals, making the dynamics more comprehensible and predictable for PLMs. To avoid information bottleneck from a limited vocabulary, we further propose a discrete reprogramming strategy that selects relevant discrete textual information from an expanded vocabulary space in a differentiable manner. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that our proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art spatio-temporal forecasting models, particularly in data-scarce scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Road Traffic Prediction using Real-time Regional Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12882v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For traffic prediction in transportation services such as car-sharing and ride-hailing, mid-term road traffic prediction (within a few hours) is considered essential. However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective.

The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Prediction Methodology Based on Deep Learning and Real Wi-Fi Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09423v1)** | 2024-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Wi-Fi technologies in recent years has caused a significant increase in the traffic usage. Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead. We made our proposed OpenCity model open-source and it is available at the following link: https://github.com/HKUDS/OpenCity.</p></details> | 12 pages |

The safety risk and urgency of autonomous vehicles in the absence of collision are evaluated. To ensure safety and improve road efficiency, a method of pre-compiling the spatio-temporal trajectory of vehicles is established to eliminate conflicts between vehicles in advance. The calculation method of the safe distance under spatio-temporal conditions is studied, considering vehicle speed differences, vehicle positioning errors, and clock errors. By combining collision acceleration and urgent acceleration, an evaluation model for vehicle conflict risk is constructed. Mainline vehicles that may have conflicts with on-ramp vehicles are identified, and the target gap for on-ramp vehicles is determined. Finally, a cooperative control method is established based on the selected target gap, preparing the vehicle travel path in advance. Taking highway ramp merge as an example, the mainline priority spatio-temporal cooperative control method is proposed and verified through simulation.

In microservices systems, this task encounters the challenge of dynamic and complex spatio-temporal relationships among microservice instances, primarily due to dynamic deployments, diverse call paths, and cascading effects among instances. Current time-series forecasting methods, which focus mainly on intrinsic patterns, are insufficient in environments where spatial relationships are critical. Similarly, spatio-temporal graph approaches often neglect the nature of temporal trend, concentrating mostly on message passing between nodes. Moreover, current research in microservices domain frequently underestimates the importance of network metrics and topological structures in capturing the evolving dynamics of systems. This paper introduces STMformer, a model tailored for forecasting system states in microservices environments, capable of handling multi-node and multivariate time series. Our method leverages dynamic network connection data and topological information to assist in modeling the intricate spatio-temporal relationships within the system. Additionally, we integrate the PatchCrossAttention module to compute the impact of cascading effects globally. We have developed a dataset based on a microservices system and conducted comprehensive experiments with STMformer against leading methods. In both short-term and long-term forecasting tasks, our model consistently achieved a 8.6% reduction in MAE(Mean Absolute Error) and a 2.2% reduction in MSE (Mean Squared Error).

Nonetheless, these methods mainly adopt imagepair appearance matching and face challenges of the intrinsic high quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism, resulting in constrained exploitation of temporal information. Inspired by the recently emerged State Space Model Mamba, renowned for its impressive long sequence modeling capabilities and linear computational complexity, this work innovatively proposes a pure Mamba-based framework (MambaVT) to fully exploit spatio-temporal contextual modeling for robust visible-thermal tracking. Specifically, we devise the long-range cross-frame integration component to globally adapt to target appearance variations, and introduce short-term historical trajectory prompts to predict the subsequent target states based on local temporal location clues. Extensive experiments show the significant potential of vision Mamba for RGB-T tracking, with MambaVT achieving state-of-the-art performance on four mainstream benchmarks while requiring lower computational costs. We aim for this work to serve as a simple yet strong baseline, stimulating future research in this field. The code and pre-trained models will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Spatio-Temporal Processing in Spiking Neural Networks through Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07517v1)** | 2024-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient implementations of spiking neural networks on neuromorphic hardware promise orders of magnitude less power consumption than their non-spiking counterparts. The standard neuron model for spike-based computation on such neuromorphic systems has long been the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) neuron. As a promising advancement, a computationally light augmentation of the LIF neuron model with an adaptation mechanism experienced a recent upswing in popularity, caused by demonstrations of its superior performance on spatio-temporal processing tasks. The root of the superiority of these so-called adaptive LIF neurons however, is not well understood. In this article, we thoroughly analyze the dynamical, computational, and learning properties of adaptive LIF neurons and networks thereof. We find that the frequently observed stability problems during training of such networks can be overcome by applying an alternative discretization method that results in provably better stability properties than the commonly used Euler-Forward method. With this discretization, we achieved a new state-of-the-art performance on common event-based benchmark datasets. We also show that the superiority of networks of adaptive LIF neurons extends to the prediction and generation of complex time series. Our further analysis of the computational properties of networks of adaptive LIF neurons shows that they are particularly well suited to exploit the spatio-temporal structure of input sequences. Furthermore, these networks are surprisingly robust to shifts of the mean input strength and input spike rate, even when these shifts were not observed during training. As a consequence, high-performance networks can be obtained without any normalization techniques such as batch normalization or batch-normalization through time.</p></details> |  |

The weak dependence condition for arrays of random fields is proved to be inherited through transformation and infinite shift. This paves a way to prove the consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimation for dynamic spatio-temporal models (i.e. so-called ultra high-dimensional time series models) when the sample size and/or dimension go to infinity. Especially the asymptotic properties of estimation for network autoregression are obtained under reasonable regularity conditions.</p></details> |  |

This compressor comprehensively considers both temporal and spatial information, encompassing many existing specific compressors. We use the average consensus algorithm as a starting point and further studies distributed optimization algorithms, the Prime-Dual algorithm as an example, in both continuous and discrete time forms. We find that under stronger additional assumptions, the spatio-temporal compressor can be directly applied to distributed computing algorithms, while its default form can also be successfully applied through observer-based differential compression methods, ensuring the linear convergence of the algorithm when the objective function is strongly convex. On this basis, we also discuss the acceleration of the algorithm, filter-based compression methods in the literature, and the addition of randomness to the spatio-temporal compressor. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the generality of the spatio-temporal compressor, compare different compression methods, and verify the algorithm's performance in the convex objective function scenario.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02332</p></details> |
| **[Weakly Supervised Video Anomaly Detection and Localization with Spatio-Temporal Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05905v2)** | 2024-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current weakly supervised video anomaly detection (WSVAD) task aims to achieve frame-level anomalous event detection with only coarse video-level annotations available. Existing works typically involve extracting global features from full-resolution video frames and training frame-level classifiers to detect anomalies in the temporal dimension. However, most anomalous events tend to occur in localized spatial regions rather than the entire video frames, which implies existing frame-level feature based works may be misled by the dominant background information and lack the interpretation of the detected anomalies. To address this dilemma, this paper introduces a novel method called STPrompt that learns spatio-temporal prompt embeddings for weakly supervised video anomaly detection and localization (WSVADL) based on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Our proposed method employs a two-stream network structure, with one stream focusing on the temporal dimension and the other primarily on the spatial dimension. By leveraging the learned knowledge from pre-trained VLMs and incorporating natural motion priors from raw videos, our model learns prompt embeddings that are aligned with spatio-temporal regions of videos (e.g., patches of individual frames) for identify specific local regions of anomalies, enabling accurate video anomaly detection while mitigating the influence of background information. Without relying on detailed spatio-temporal annotations or auxiliary object detection/tracking, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public benchmarks for the WSVADL task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACMMM2024</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs. The code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v3)** | 2024-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.</p></details> |  |

Yet, these models fall short of quantifying future uncertainties. Recently, many probabilistic methods, especially variants of diffusion models, have been proposed to fill this gap. However, existing diffusion methods typically deal with individual sensors separately when generating future time series, resulting in limited usage of spatial information in the probabilistic learning process. In this work, we propose SpecSTG, a novel spectral diffusion framework, to better leverage spatial dependencies and systematic patterns inherent in traffic data. More specifically, our method generates the Fourier representation of future time series, transforming the learning process into the spectral domain enriched with spatial information. Additionally, our approach incorporates a fast spectral graph convolution designed for Fourier input, alleviating the computational burden associated with existing models. Compared with state-of-the-arts, SpecSTG achieves up to 8% improvements on point estimations and up to 0.78% improvements on quantifying future uncertainties. Furthermore, SpecSTG's training and validation speed is 3.33X of the most efficient existing diffusion method for STG forecasting.

However, acquiring high-resolution MRI typically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts. Super-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate these challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel frequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more fine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data and low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR methods with statistical significance.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 15th International Workshop on Machine Learning in Medical Imaging (MLMI 2024)</p></details> |

The central aim of multi-agent optimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level optimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node communication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms crucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number of communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been proposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general spatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting dynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several important distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier, the uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this spatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows with the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and local error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the node trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions. Finally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

Most existing studies show satisfying performance under regular scenarios, but most neglected safety-critical scenarios. In this study, a spatio-temporal dual-encoder network named STDA for safety-critical scenarios was developed. Considering the exceptional capabilities of human drivers in terms of situational awareness and comprehending risks, driver attention was incorporated into STDA to facilitate swift identification of the critical regions, which is expected to improve both performance and interpretability. STDA contains four parts: the driver attention prediction module, which predicts driver attention; the fusion module designed to fuse the features between driver attention and raw images; the temporary encoder module used to enhance the capability to interpret dynamic scenes; and the behavior prediction module to predict the behavior. The experiment data are used to train and validate the model. The results show that STDA improves the G-mean from 0.659 to 0.719 when incorporating driver attention and adopting a temporal encoder module. In addition, extensive experimentation has been conducted to validate that the proposed module exhibits robust generalization capabilities and can be seamlessly integrated into other mainstream models.</p></details> |  |

This study, part of the European LAMASUS (Land Management for Sustainability) project, aims to support the EU's climate neutrality target by developing a governance model through collaboration between policymakers, land users, and researchers. We present a methodological synthesis for treating land use data using a Bayesian approach within spatial and spatio-temporal modeling frameworks. The study tackles the challenges of analyzing land use changes, particularly the presence of zero values and computational issues with large datasets.

Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose an overarching model named the Structurally-Aware Recurrent Network (SARN), which integrates structurally-aware spatial attention (SASA) layers into the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Each SASA layer calculates both global and structural attention -- global attention facilitates comprehensive interactions between different geographic levels, while structural attention leverages the containment relationship between different geographic levels (e.g., a city block being wholly contained within a census tract) to ensure coherent and consistent results. For scenarios with limited historical training data, we explore transfer learning and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that on both datasets, SARN significantly outperforms other neural models (5% and 1%) and typical heuristic methods (40% and 14%), enabling us to generate realistic, high-quality fine-grained data for downstream applications.</p></details> |  |

Different from conventional approaches that statically estimate fetal brain motions from pairs of images, our method dynamically tracks the rigid movement patterns of the fetal head across temporal and spatial dimensions. Specifically, we first develop an equivariant neural network that efficiently learns rigid motion sequences through low-dimensional spatial representations of images. Subsequently, we learn spatio-temporal representations by incorporating time encoding and self-attention neural network layers. This approach allows for the capture of long-term dependencies of fetal brain motion and addresses alignment errors due to contrast changes and severe motion artifacts. Our model also provides a geometric deformation estimation that properly addresses image distortions among all time frames. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first to learn spatial-temporal representations via deep neural networks for fetal motion tracking without data augmentation. We validated our model using real fetal echo-planar images with simulated and real motions. Our method carries significant potential value in accurately measuring, tracking, and correcting fetal motion in fetal MRI sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Interventions (MICCAI) Workshop on Perinatal Imaging, Placental and Preterm Image analysis (PIPPI) 2024</p></details> |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v1)** | 2024-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> |  |

These programs are being increasingly asked to provide forest parameter estimates for spatial and temporal extents smaller than their current design and accompanying design-based methods can deliver with desired levels of uncertainty. Many NFI designs and estimation methods focus on status and are not well equipped to provide acceptable estimates for trend and change parameters, especially over small spatial domains and/or short time periods. Fine-scale space-time indexed estimates are critical to a variety of environmental, ecological, and economic monitoring efforts. Estimates for forest carbon status, trend, and change are of particular importance to international initiatives to track carbon dynamics. Model-based small area estimation (SAE) methods for NFI and similar ecological monitoring data typically pursue inference on status within small spatial domains, with few demonstrated methods that account for spatio-temporal dependence needed for trend and change estimation. We propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian model framework that delivers statistically valid estimates with full uncertainty quantification for status, trend, and change. The framework accommodates a variety of space and time dependency structures, and we detail model configurations for different settings. Through analysis of simulated datasets, we compare the relative performance of candidate models and a traditional direct estimator. We then apply candidate models to a large-scale NFI dataset to demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework for providing unique quantification of forest carbon dynamics in the contiguous United States. We also provide computationally efficient algorithms, software, and data to reproduce our results and for benchmarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpotFormer: Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20799v1)** | 2024-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting, identifying periods where facial expressions occur in a video, is a significant yet challenging task in facial expression analysis. The issues of irrelevant facial movements and the challenge of detecting subtle motions in micro-expressions remain unresolved, hindering accurate expression spotting. In this paper, we propose an efficient framework for facial expression spotting. First, we propose a Sliding Window-based Multi-Resolution Optical flow (SW-MRO) feature, which calculates multi-resolution optical flow of the input image sequence within compact sliding windows. The window length is tailored to perceive complete micro-expressions and distinguish between general macro- and micro-expressions. SW-MRO can effectively reveal subtle motions while avoiding severe head movement problems. Second, we propose SpotFormer, a multi-scale spatio-temporal Transformer that simultaneously encodes spatio-temporal relationships of the SW-MRO features for accurate frame-level probability estimation. In SpotFormer, our proposed Facial Local Graph Pooling (FLGP) and convolutional layers are applied for multi-scale spatio-temporal feature extraction. We show the validity of the architecture of SpotFormer by comparing it with several model variants. Third, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into SpotFormer to enhance the discriminability between different types of expressions. Extensive experiments on SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in micro-expression spotting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Orca: Ocean Significant Wave Height Estimation with Spatio-temporally Aware Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20053v1)** | 2024-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant wave height (SWH) is a vital metric in marine science, and accurate SWH estimation is crucial for various applications, e.g., marine energy development, fishery, early warning systems for potential risks, etc. Traditional SWH estimation methods that are based on numerical models and physical theories are hindered by computational inefficiencies. Recently, machine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy and reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology and high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of machine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH estimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited spatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal aware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data temporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt templates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to estimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental results on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art performance in SWH estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deepsets for Off-policy Evaluation under Spatial or Spatio-temporal Interferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17910v1)** | 2024-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Off-policy evaluation (OPE) is widely applied in sectors such as pharmaceuticals and e-commerce to evaluate the efficacy of novel products or policies from offline datasets. This paper introduces a causal deepset framework that relaxes several key structural assumptions, primarily the mean-field assumption, prevalent in existing OPE methodologies that handle spatio-temporal interference. These traditional assumptions frequently prove inadequate in real-world settings, thereby restricting the capability of current OPE methods to effectively address complex interference effects. In response, we advocate for the implementation of the permutation invariance (PI) assumption. This innovative approach enables the data-driven, adaptive learning of the mean-field function, offering a more flexible estimation method beyond conventional averaging. Furthermore, we present novel algorithms that incorporate the PI assumption into OPE and thoroughly examine their theoretical foundations. Our numerical analyses demonstrate that this novel approach yields significantly more precise estimations than existing baseline algorithms, thereby substantially improving the practical applicability and effectiveness of OPE methodologies. A Python implementation of our proposed method is available at https://github.com/BIG-S2/Causal-Deepsets.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either utilize multi-modal information in video-text pairs or apply global and local alignment techniques to promote alignment precision. However, these methods often fail to fully explore the spatio-temporal relationships among vision tokens within video and across different video-text pairs. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer module to uniformly learn spatial and temporal contexts for video-language alignment pre-training (dubbed STGT). Specifically, our STGT combines spatio-temporal graph structure information with attention in transformer block, effectively utilizing the spatio-temporal contexts. In this way, we can model the relationships between vision tokens, promoting video-text alignment precision for benefiting downstream tasks. In addition, we propose a self-similarity alignment loss to explore the inherent self-similarity in the video and text. With the initial optimization achieved by contrastive learning, it can further promote the alignment accuracy between video and text. Experimental results on challenging downstream tasks, including video-text retrieval and video question answering, verify the superior performance of our method.</p></details> | under review |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

| **[Towards Effective Fusion and Forecasting of Multimodal Spatio-temporal Data for Smart Mobility](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16123v1)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of location based services, multimodal spatio-temporal (ST) data including trajectories, transportation modes, traffic flow and social check-ins are being collected for deep learning based methods. These deep learning based methods learn ST correlations to support the downstream tasks in the fields such as smart mobility, smart city and other intelligent transportation systems. Despite their effectiveness, ST data fusion and forecasting methods face practical challenges in real-world scenarios. First, forecasting performance for ST data-insufficient area is inferior, making it necessary to transfer meta knowledge from heterogeneous area to enhance the sparse representations. Second, it is nontrivial to accurately forecast in multi-transportation-mode scenarios due to the fine-grained ST features of similar transportation modes, making it necessary to distinguish and measure the ST correlations to alleviate the influence caused by entangled ST features. At last, partial data modalities (e.g., transportation mode) are lost due to privacy or technical issues in certain scenarios, making it necessary to effectively fuse the multimodal sparse ST features and enrich the ST representations. To tackle these challenges, our research work aim to develop effective fusion and forecasting methods for multimodal ST data in smart mobility scenario. In this paper, we will introduce our recent works that investigates the challenges in terms of various real-world applications and establish the open challenges in this field for future work.</p></details> | 4 pages |

Although Bayesian methods are common in spatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this problem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach. This method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying an appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results from each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique to obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed methodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby offering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we analyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle layer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The methodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various amenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon emissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it shows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material is available from the authors upon request</p></details> |
| **[The SPDE approach for spatio-temporal datasets with advection and diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.14015v4)** | 2024-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the task of predicting spatio-temporal fields in environmental science using statistical methods, introducing statistical models inspired by the physics of the underlying phenomena that are numerically efficient is of growing interest. Large space-time datasets call for new numerical methods to efficiently process them. The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach has proven to be effective for the estimation and the prediction in a spatial context. We present here the advection-diffusion SPDE with first order derivative in time which defines a large class of nonseparable spatio-temporal models. A Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution to the SPDE is built by discretizing the temporal derivative with a finite difference method (implicit Euler) and by solving the spatial SPDE with a finite element method (continuous Galerkin) at each time step. The ''Streamline Diffusion'' stabilization technique is introduced when the advection term dominates the diffusion. Computationally efficient methods are proposed to estimate the parameters of the SPDE and to predict the spatio-temporal field by kriging, as well as to perform conditional simulations. The approach is applied to a solar radiation dataset. Its advantages and limitations are discussed.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Approach with Self-Corrective Causal Inference for Flight Delay Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15185v1)** | 2024-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate flight delay prediction is crucial for the secure and effective operation of the air traffic system. Recent advances in modeling inter-airport relationships present a promising approach for investigating flight delay prediction from the multi-airport scenario. However, the previous prediction works only accounted for the simplistic relationships such as traffic flow or geographical distance, overlooking the intricate interactions among airports and thus proving inadequate. In this paper, we leverage causal inference to precisely model inter-airport relationships and propose a self-corrective spatio-temporal graph neural network (named CausalNet) for flight delay prediction. Specifically, Granger causality inference coupled with a self-correction module is designed to construct causality graphs among airports and dynamically modify them based on the current airport's delays. Additionally, the features of the causality graphs are adaptively extracted and utilized to address the heterogeneity of airports. Extensive experiments are conducted on the real data of top-74 busiest airports in China. The results show that CausalNet is superior to baselines. Ablation studies emphasize the power of the proposed self-correction causality graph and the graph feature extraction module. All of these prove the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Source and Test-Time Domain Adaptation on Multivariate Signals using Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14303v1)** | 2024-07-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning applications on signals such as computer vision or biomedical data often face significant challenges due to the variability that exists across hardware devices or session recordings. This variability poses a Domain Adaptation (DA) problem, as training and testing data distributions often differ. In this work, we propose Spatio-Temporal Monge Alignment (STMA) to mitigate these variabilities. This Optimal Transport (OT) based method adapts the cross-power spectrum density (cross-PSD) of multivariate signals by mapping them to the Wasserstein barycenter of source domains (multi-source DA). Predictions for new domains can be done with a filtering without the need for retraining a model with source data (test-time DA). We also study and discuss two special cases of the method, Temporal Monge Alignment (TMA) and Spatial Monge Alignment (SMA). Non-asymptotic concentration bounds are derived for the mappings estimation, which reveals a bias-plus-variance error structure with a variance decay rate of $\mathcal{O}(n_\ell^{-1/2})$ with $n_\ell$ the signal length. This theoretical guarantee demonstrates the efficiency of the proposed computational schema. Numerical experiments on multivariate biosignals and image data show that STMA leads to significant and consistent performance gains between datasets acquired with very different settings. Notably, STMA is a pre-processing step complementary to state-of-the-art deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Higher-order Spatio-temporal Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v2)** | 2024-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and machine learning techniques, which often struggle to model the complex dynamics of human motion. Recent deep learning-based methods have achieved success by learning spatio-temporal representations of motion, but these models often overlook the reliability of motion data. Additionally, the temporal and spatial dependencies of skeleton nodes are distinct. The temporal relationship captures motion information over time, while the spatial relationship describes body structure and the relationships between different nodes. In this paper, we propose a novel spatio-temporal branching network using incremental information for HMP, which decouples the learning of temporal-domain and spatial-domain features, extracts more motion information, and achieves complementary cross-domain knowledge learning through knowledge distillation. Our approach effectively reduces noise interference and provides more expressive information for characterizing motion by separately extracting temporal and spatial features. We evaluate our approach on standard HMP benchmarks and outperform state-of-the-art methods in terms of prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>The i...</summary><p>The incremental information of our paper includes the displacement information from the last frame of the historical sequence, derived from the motion information of the first frame in the future sequence and the motion information of the last frame of the historical sequence.

Changes in the size, shape and movement of the chambers can be important markers for cardiac disease and modeling this in relation to clinical demography or disease is therefore of interest. Existing methods for spatio-temporal modeling of the human heart require shape correspondence over time or suffer from large memory requirements, making it difficult to use for complex anatomies. We introduce a novel conditional generative model, where the shape and movement is modeled implicitly in the form of a spatio-temporal neural distance field and conditioned on clinical demography. The model is based on an auto-decoder architecture and aims to disentangle the individual variations from that related to the clinical demography. It is tested on the left atrium (including the left atrial appendage), where it outperforms current state-of-the-art methods for anatomical sequence completion and generates synthetic sequences that realistically mimics the shape and motion of the real left atrium. In practice, this means we can infer functional measurements from a static image, generate synthetic populations with specified demography or disease and investigate how non-imaging clinical data effect the shape and motion of cardiac anatomies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for MICCAI2024</p></details> |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared spatio-temporal components to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal effects between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models. Our results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models incorporating a flexible shared spatio-temporal term outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models that include specific spatio-temporal effects for each health outcome. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative health care districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 40 pages, 12 figures |

| **[Adaptive Inference-Time Compute: LLMs Can Predict if They Can Do Better, Even Mid-Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02725v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time computation is a powerful paradigm to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs), with Best-of-N sampling being a widely used technique. However, this method is computationally expensive, requiring both (1) an external reward model and (2) the generation of multiple samples. In this work, we introduce a new generative self-evaluation scheme designed to adaptively reduce the number of generated samples while maintaining or even improving performance. We use a generative reward model formulation, allowing the LLM to predict mid-generation the probability that restarting the generation will yield a better response. These predictions are obtained without an external reward model and can be used to decide whether or not to generate more samples, prune unpromising samples early on, or to pick the best sample. This capability is very inexpensive as it involves generating a single predefined token. Trained using a dataset constructed with real unfiltered LMSYS user prompts, Llama 3.1 8B's win rate against GPT-4 on AlpacaEval increases from 21% to 34% with 16 samples and math performance on GSM8K improves from 84% to 91%. By sampling only when the LLM determines that it is beneficial to do so and adaptively adjusting temperature annealing, we demonstrate that 74% of the improvement from using 16 samples can be achieved with only 1.2 samples on average. We further demonstrate that 50-75% of samples can be pruned early in generation with minimal degradation in performance. Overall, our methods enable more efficient and scalable compute utilization during inference for LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyGPrompt: Learning Feature and Time Prompts on Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13937v6)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graphs capture evolving interactions between entities, such as in social networks, online learning platforms, and crowdsourcing projects. For dynamic graph modeling, dynamic graph neural networks (DGNNs) have emerged as a mainstream technique. However, they are generally pre-trained on the link prediction task, leaving a significant gap from the objectives of downstream tasks such as node classification. To bridge the gap, prompt-based learning has gained traction on graphs, but most existing efforts focus on static graphs, neglecting the evolution of dynamic graphs. In this paper, we propose DYGPROMPT, a novel pre-training and prompt learning framework for dynamic graph modeling. First, we design dual prompts to address the gap in both task objectives and temporal variations across pre-training and downstream tasks. Second, we recognize that node and time features mutually characterize each other, and propose dual condition-nets to model the evolving node-time patterns in downstream tasks. Finally, we thoroughly evaluate and analyze DYGPROMPT through extensive experiments on four public datasets.</p></details> | Under review |

This paper proposes a simple but effective method that leverages the existing vision encoders of these models to "see" time-series data via plots, avoiding the need for additional, potentially costly, model training. Our empirical evaluations show that this approach outperforms providing the raw time-series data as text, with the additional benefit that visual time-series representations demonstrate up to a 90% reduction in model API costs. We validate our hypothesis through synthetic data tasks of increasing complexity, progressing from simple functional form identification on clean data, to extracting trends from noisy scatter plots. To demonstrate generalizability from synthetic tasks with clear reasoning steps to more complex, real-world scenarios, we apply our approach to consumer health tasks - specifically fall detection, activity recognition, and readiness assessment - which involve heterogeneous, noisy data and multi-step reasoning. The overall success in plot performance over text performance (up to an 120% performance increase on zero-shot synthetic tasks, and up to 150% performance increase on real-world tasks), across both GPT and Gemini model families, highlights our approach's potential for making the best use of the native capabilities of foundation models.</p></details> | 49 pages |

Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods address this issue by adapting models using test samples at inference time. However, current ASR TTA methods have largely focused on non-continual TTA, which limits cross-sample knowledge learning compared to continual TTA. In this work, we first propose a Fast-slow TTA framework for ASR that leverages the advantage of continual and non-continual TTA. Following this framework, we introduce Dynamic SUTA (DSUTA), an entropy-minimization-based continual TTA method for ASR. To enhance DSUTA robustness for time-varying data, we design a dynamic reset strategy to automatically detect domain shifts and reset the model, making it more effective at handling multi-domain data. Our method demonstrates superior performance on various noisy ASR datasets, outperforming both non-continual and continual TTA baselines while maintaining robustness to domain changes without requiring domain boundary information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

We propose a probabilistic framework for attention, enabling us to derive a novel low-rank linear re-parameterisation of both bidirectional and causal cases, based on defining a latent variable model. Our method can be seamlessly integrated as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Additionally, this framework provides a natural extension for combining local standard attention with our global linear attention. This approach allows us to extend the context length of existing large pre-trained models with only a few additional training steps. The resulting ``Latte Transformer'' achieves performance comparable to standard attention and other state-of-the-art models, while maintaining linear time and memory complexity, along with constant-time next-token prediction during inference.</p></details> |  |

Although models based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers have achieved remarkable success in medical image segmentation tasks, they still face challenges such as high computational complexity and the loss of local features when capturing long-range dependencies. To address these limitations, we propose Med-TTT, a visual backbone network integrated with Test-Time Training (TTT) layers, which incorporates dynamic adjustment capabilities. Med-TTT introduces the Vision-TTT layer, which enables effective modeling of long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity and adaptive parameter adjustment during inference. Furthermore, we designed a multi-resolution fusion mechanism to combine image features at different scales, facilitating the identification of subtle lesion characteristics in complex backgrounds. At the same time, we adopt a frequency domain feature enhancement strategy based on high pass filtering, which can better capture texture and fine-grained details in images. Experimental results demonstrate that Med-TTT significantly outperforms existing methods on multiple medical image datasets, exhibiting strong segmentation capabilities, particularly in complex image backgrounds. The model achieves leading performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and Dice coefficient, providing an efficient and robust solution for the field of medical image segmentation.The code is available at https://github.com/Jiashu-Xu/Med-TTT .</p></details> |  |

The equivalence leads to the Myhill-Nerode theorem and a canonical automaton, which in turn, is the basis of several automata learning algorithms. A Nerode-like equivalence has been studied for various classes of timed languages. In this work, we focus on timed automata with integer resets. This class is known to have good automata-theoretic properties and is also useful for practical modeling. Our main contribution is a Nerode-style equivalence for this class that depends on a constant K. We show that the equivalence leads to a Myhill-Nerode theorem and a canonical one-clock integer-reset timed automaton with maximum constant K. Based on the canonical form, we develop an Angluin-style active learning algorithm whose query complexity is polynomial in the size of the canonical form.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, to be published at the 44th IARCS Annual Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science</p></details> |

While current methods generally ensure linear time complexity, our observations on temporal redundancy show that high-level features are learned 98.44\% slower than low-level features. To address this issue, we introduce a new exponentially weighted stochastic gradient descent algorithm designed to achieve constant time complexity in deep learning models. We prove that the theoretical complexity of this learning method is constant. Evaluation of this method on Kernel U-Net (K-U-Net) on synthetic datasets shows a significant reduction in complexity while improving the accuracy of the test set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Functional Latent Dynamics for Irregularly Sampled Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03582v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Irregularly sampled time series with missing values are often observed in multiple real-world applications such as healthcare, climate and astronomy. They pose a significant challenge to standard deep learning models that operate only on fully observed and regularly sampled time series. In order to capture the continuous dynamics of the irregular time series, many models rely on solving an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in the hidden state. These ODE-based models tend to perform slow and require large memory due to sequential operations and a complex ODE solver. As an alternative to complex ODE-based models, we propose a family of models called Functional Latent Dynamics (FLD). Instead of solving the ODE, we use simple curves which exist at all time points to specify the continuous latent state in the model. The coefficients of these curves are learned only from the observed values in the time series ignoring the missing values. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FLD achieves better performance compared to the best ODE-based model while reducing the runtime and memory overhead. Specifically, FLD requires an order of magnitude less time to infer the forecasts compared to the best performing forecasting model.</p></details> |  |

Compared to previous methods that rely on descriptor field matching, RiEMann directly predicts the target poses of objects for manipulation without any object segmentation. RiEMann learns a manipulation task from scratch with 5 to 10 demonstrations, generalizes to unseen SE(3) transformations and instances of target objects, resists visual interference of distracting objects, and follows the near real-time pose change of the target object. The scalable action space of RiEMann facilitates the addition of custom equivariant actions such as the direction of turning the faucet, which makes articulated object manipulation possible for RiEMann. In simulation and real-world 6-DOF robot manipulation experiments, we test RiEMann on 5 categories of manipulation tasks with a total of 25 variants and show that RiEMann outperforms baselines in both task success rates and SE(3) geodesic distance errors on predicted poses (reduced by 68.6%), and achieves a 5.4 frames per second (FPS) network inference speed.

These patterns are used to produce a rich set of transaction features for downstream machine learning training and inference tasks such as detection of fraudulent financial transactions. We show that our enriched transaction features dramatically improve the prediction accuracy of gradient-boosting-based machine learning models. Our library exploits multicore parallelism, maintains a dynamic in-memory graph, and efficiently mines subgraph patterns in the incoming transaction stream, which enables it to be operated in a streaming manner. Our solution, which combines our Graph Feature Preprocessor and gradient-boosting-based machine learning models, can detect illicit transactions with higher minority-class F1 scores than standard graph neural networks in anti-money laundering and phishing datasets. In addition, the end-to-end throughput rate of our solution executed on a multicore CPU outperforms the graph neural network baselines executed on a powerful V100 GPU. Overall, the combination of high accuracy, a high throughput rate, and low latency of our solution demonstrates the practical value of our library in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM I...</summary><p>ACM ICAIF'24, extended version</p></details> |

Our algorithm solves a more general problem: given $n$ and $\omega$ as input, it computes the number of $\omega$-colorable labeled chordal graphs on $n$ vertices, using $O(n^7)$ arithmetic operations. A standard sampling-to-counting reduction then yields a polynomial-time exact sampler that generates an $\omega$-colorable labeled chordal graph on $n$ vertices uniformly at random. Our counting algorithm improves upon the previous best result by Wormald (1985), which computes the number of labeled chordal graphs on $n$ vertices in time exponential in $n$. An implementation of the polynomial-time counting algorithm gives the number of labeled chordal graphs on up to $30$ vertices in less than three minutes on a standard desktop computer. Previously, the number of labeled chordal graphs was only known for graphs on up to $15$ vertices. In addition, we design two approximation algorithms: (1) an approximate counting algorithm that computes a $(1\pm\varepsilon)$-approximation of the number of $n$-vertex labeled chordal graphs, and (2) an approximate sampling algorithm that generates a random labeled chordal graph according to a distribution whose total variation distance from the uniform distribution is at most $\varepsilon$. The approximate counting algorithm runs in $O(n^3\log{n}\log^7(1/\varepsilon))$ time, and the approximate sampling algorithm runs in $O(n^3\log{n}\log^7(1/\varepsilon))$ expected time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ESA 2023 (European Symposium on Algorithms); 52 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

While the theoretical guarantees for continuous-state diffusion models have been extensively studied, the convergence analysis of the discrete-state counterparts remains under-explored. In this paper, we study the theoretical aspects of score-based discrete diffusion models under the Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC) framework. We introduce a discrete-time sampling algorithm in the general state space $[S]^d$ that utilizes score estimators at predefined time points. We derive convergence bounds for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and total variation (TV) distance between the generated sample distribution and the data distribution, considering both scenarios with and without early stopping under specific assumptions. Notably, our KL divergence bounds are nearly linear in dimension $d$, aligning with state-of-the-art results for diffusion models. Our convergence analysis employs a Girsanov-based method and establishes key properties of the discrete score function, which are essential for characterizing the discrete-time sampling process.</p></details> | 31 pages, 1 figure |

AI-driven recognition systems provide notable advantages in the food sector, including improved nutrient tracking, tackling food waste, and boosting food production and consumption efficiency. Accurate food classification is a crucial initial step in utilizing advanced AI models, as the effectiveness of this process directly influences the success of subsequent operations; therefore, achieving high accuracy at a reasonable speed is essential. Despite existing research efforts, a gap persists in improving performance while ensuring rapid processing times, prompting researchers to pursue cost-effective and precise models. This study addresses this gap by employing the state-of-the-art EfficientNetB7 architecture, enhanced through transfer learning, data augmentation, and the CBAM attention module. This methodology results in a robust model that surpasses previous studies in accuracy while maintaining rapid processing suitable for real-world applications. The Food11 dataset from Kaggle was utilized, comprising 16643 imbalanced images across 11 diverse classes with significant intra-category diversities and inter-category similarities. Furthermore, the proposed methodology, bolstered by various deep learning techniques, consistently achieves an impressive average accuracy of 96.40%. Notably, it can classify over 60 images within one second during inference on unseen data, demonstrating its ability to deliver high accuracy promptly. This underscores its potential for practical applications in accurate food classification and enhancing efficiency in subsequent processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, six figures, two tables</p></details> |
| **[Archon: An Architecture Search Framework for Inference-Time Techniques](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15254v5)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time techniques are emerging as highly effective tools to enhance large language model (LLM) capabilities. However, best practices for developing systems that combine these techniques remain underdeveloped due to our limited understanding of the utility of individual inference-time techniques and the interactions between them. Additionally, efficiently and automatically searching the space of model choices, inference-time techniques, and their compositions is challenging due to the large design space. To address these challenges, we introduce Archon, a modular framework for selecting, combining, and stacking layers of inference-time techniques to construct optimized LLM systems for target benchmarks. Rather than relying on a single LLM called once, we leverage a diverse set of LLMs and inference-time techniques, creating LLM systems greater than the sum of their parts. Archon defines an extensible design space, encompassing techniques such as generation ensembling, repeated sampling, ranking, fusion, critiquing, verification, and unit testing. It transforms the problem of building LLM systems into a hyperparameter optimization objective. Given the available LLMs, inference-time techniques, and compute budget, Archon utilizes hyperparameter search techniques to discover optimized architectures for target benchmark(s). We evaluate Archon architectures across a range of instruction-following, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, including MT-Bench, Arena-Hard-Auto, AlpacaEval 2.0, MixEval, MixEval Hard, MATH, and CodeContests. Archon architectures outperform frontier models, such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, on these benchmarks, achieving an average accuracy increase of 15.1 percentage points by using all available LLMs. We make our code and datasets available publicly on Github: https://github.com/ScalingIntelligence/Archon.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art models often struggle to consider the data in the best way possible, as well as intrinsic uncertainties and the actual physics of the traffic. In this study, we propose a novel framework to incorporate travel times between stations into a weighted adjacency matrix of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture with information from traffic stations based on their data availability. To handle uncertainty, we utilized the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) method that adjusts prediction intervals based on real-time validation residuals. To validate our results, we model a microscopic traffic scenario and perform a Monte-Carlo simulation to get a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT), and this distribution is compared against the real-world data. Experiments show that the proposed model outperformed the next-best model by approximately 24% in MAE and 8% in RMSE and validation showed the simulated travel time closely matches the 95th percentile of the observed travel time value.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted at the IEEE International Transportation Systems Conference (ITSC) 2024 which will be held September 24- 27, 2024 in Edmonton, Canada</p></details> |

While a myriad of powerful deep learning models have been developed for this task, few works have explored the robustness of MTS forecasting models to malicious attacks, which is crucial for their trustworthy employment in high-stake scenarios. To address this gap, we dive deep into the backdoor attacks on MTS forecasting models and propose an effective attack method named BackTime.By subtly injecting a few stealthy triggers into the MTS data, BackTime can alter the predictions of the forecasting model according to the attacker's intent. Specifically, BackTime first identifies vulnerable timestamps in the data for poisoning, and then adaptively synthesizes stealthy and effective triggers by solving a bi-level optimization problem with a GNN-based trigger generator. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and state-of-the-art MTS forecasting models demonstrate the effectiveness, versatility, and stealthiness of \method{} attacks.

| **[Channel-aware Contrastive Conditional Diffusion for Multivariate Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02168v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting faithful trajectories of multivariate time series from practical scopes is essential for reasonable decision-making. Recent methods majorly tailor generative conditional diffusion models to estimate the target temporal predictive distribution. However, it remains an obstacle to enhance the exploitation efficiency of given implicit temporal predictive information to bolster conditional diffusion learning. To this end, we propose a generic channel-aware Contrastive Conditional Diffusion model entitled CCDM to achieve desirable Multivariate probabilistic forecasting, obviating the need for curated temporal conditioning inductive biases. In detail, we first design a channel-centric conditional denoising network to manage intra-variate variations and cross-variate correlations, which can lead to scalability on diverse prediction horizons and channel numbers. Then, we devise an ad-hoc denoising-based temporal contrastive learning to explicitly amplify the predictive mutual information between past observations and future forecasts. It can coherently complement naive step-wise denoising diffusion training and improve the forecasting accuracy and generality on unknown test time series. Besides, we offer theoretic insights on the benefits of such auxiliary contrastive training refinement from both neural mutual information and temporal distribution generalization aspects. The proposed CCDM can exhibit superior forecasting capability compared to current state-of-the-art diffusion forecasters over a comprehensive benchmark, with best MSE and CRPS outcomes on $66.67\%$ and $83.33\%$ cases. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/LSY-Cython/CCDM.</p></details> |  |

Our approach introduces an improved paradigm for source-model preparation and target-side adaptation, aiming to enhance training efficiency during target adaptation. Specifically, we reparameterize the source model's weights in a Tucker-style decomposed manner, factorizing the model into a compact form during the source model preparation phase. During target-side adaptation, only a subset of these decomposed factors is fine-tuned, leading to significant improvements in training efficiency. We demonstrate using PAC Bayesian analysis that this selective fine-tuning strategy implicitly regularizes the adaptation process by constraining the model's learning capacity. Furthermore, this re-parameterization reduces the overall model size and enhances inference efficiency, making the approach particularly well suited for resource-constrained devices. Additionally, we demonstrate that our framework is compatible with various SFDA methods and achieves significant computational efficiency, reducing the number of fine-tuned parameters and inference overhead in terms of MACs by over 90% while maintaining model performance.</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |

Despite the advancements in deep learning methods for TSF, their capacity to predict long-term series remains constrained. This limitation arises from the failure to account for both intra- and inter-variable variations meanwhile. To mitigate this challenge, we introduce the Fi$^2$VBlock, which leverages a \textbf{F}requency domain perspective to capture \textbf{i}ntra- and \textbf{i}nter-variable \textbf{V}ariations. After transforming into the frequency domain via the Frequency Transform Module, the Frequency Cross Attention between the real and imaginary parts is designed to obtain enhanced frequency representations and capture intra-variable variations. Furthermore, Inception blocks are employed to integrate information, thus capturing correlations across different variables. Our backbone network, Fi$^2$VTS, employs a residual architecture by concatenating multiple Fi$^2$VBlocks, thereby preventing degradation issues. Theoretically, we demonstrate that Fi$^2$VTS achieves a substantial reduction in both time and memory complexity, decreasing from $\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L)$ per Fi$^2$VBlock computation. Empirical evaluations reveal that Fi$^2$VTS outperforms other baselines on two benchmark datasets.

Our approach combines reduced basis (RB) space for rapidly convergent approximation of the parametric solution manifold, Galerkin projection of the underlying PDEs onto the RB space for dimensionality reduction, and high-order empirical interpolation for efficient treatment of the nonlinear terms. We propose a class of high-order empirical interpolation methods to derive basis functions and interpolation points by using high-order partial derivatives of the nonlinear terms. As these methods can generate high-quality basis functions and interpolation points from a snapshot set of full-order model (FOM) solutions, they significantly improve the approximation accuracy. We develop effective a posteriori estimator to quantify the interpolation errors and construct a parameter sample via greedy sampling. Furthermore, we implement two hyperreduction schemes to construct efficient reduced-order models: one that applies the empirical interpolation before Newton's method and another after. The latter scheme shows flexibility in controlling hyperreduction errors.

The approach integrates several ingredients to develop efficient and accurate reduced-order models. Proper orthogonal decomposition is used to construct a reduced-basis (RB) space which provides a rapidly convergent approximation of the parametric solution manifold. The Galerkin projection is employed to reduce the dimensionality of the problem by projecting the weak formulation of the governing PDEs onto the RB space. A major challenge in model reduction for nonlinear PDEs is the efficient treatment of nonlinear terms, which we address by unifying the implementation of several hyperreduction methods. We introduce a first-order empirical interpolation method to approximate the nonlinear terms and recover the computational efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology through its application to the Allen-Cahn equation, which models phase separation processes, and the Buckley-Leverett equation, which describes two-phase fluid flow in porous media.

There exist significant challenges in LTSF due to its complex temporal dependencies and high computational demands. Although Transformer-based models offer high forecasting accuracy, they are often too compute-intensive to be deployed on devices with hardware constraints. On the other hand, the linear models aim to reduce the computational overhead by employing either decomposition methods in the time domain or compact representations in the frequency domain. In this paper, we propose MixLinear, an ultra-lightweight multivariate time series forecasting model specifically designed for resource-constrained devices. MixLinear effectively captures both temporal and frequency domain features by modeling intra-segment and inter-segment variations in the time domain and extracting frequency variations from a low-dimensional latent space in the frequency domain. By reducing the parameter scale of a downsampled $n$-length input/output one-layer linear model from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$, MixLinear achieves efficient computation without sacrificing accuracy. Extensive evaluations with four benchmark datasets show that MixLinear attains forecasting performance comparable to, or surpassing, state-of-the-art models with significantly fewer parameters ($0.1K$), which makes it well-suited for deployment on devices with limited computational capacity.</p></details> |  |

LTSF requires capturing long-range dependencies between inputs and outputs, which poses significant challenges due to complex temporal dynamics and high computational demands. While linear models reduce model complexity by employing frequency domain decomposition, current approaches often assume stationarity and filter out high-frequency components that may contain crucial short-term fluctuations. In this paper, we introduce MMFNet, a novel model designed to enhance long-term multivariate forecasting by leveraging a multi-scale masked frequency decomposition approach. MMFNet captures fine, intermediate, and coarse-grained temporal patterns by converting time series into frequency segments at varying scales while employing a learnable mask to filter out irrelevant components adaptively. Extensive experimentation with benchmark datasets shows that MMFNet not only addresses the limitations of the existing methods but also consistently achieves good performance. Specifically, MMFNet achieves up to 6.0% reductions in the Mean Squared Error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art models designed for multivariate forecasting tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their large-scale training, VLAs are often brittle to task-irrelevant visual details such as distractor objects or background colors. We introduce Bring Your Own VLA (BYOVLA): a run-time intervention scheme that (1) dynamically identifies regions of the input image that the model is sensitive to, and (2) minimally alters task-irrelevant regions to reduce the model's sensitivity using automated image editing tools. Our approach is compatible with any off the shelf VLA without model fine-tuning or access to the model's weights. Hardware experiments on language-instructed manipulation tasks demonstrate that BYOVLA enables state-of-the-art VLA models to nearly retain their nominal performance in the presence of distractor objects and backgrounds, which otherwise degrade task success rates by up to 40%.

Most existing studies rely upon self-report or manual measures from bulky wearable sensors, thus lacking efficiency and accuracy in capturing quantitative screen exposure data. In this work, we developed a novel sensor informatics framework that utilizes egocentric images from a wearable sensor, termed the screen time tracker (STT), and a vision language model (VLM). In particular, we devised a multi-view VLM that takes multiple views from egocentric image sequences and interprets screen exposure dynamically. We validated our approach by using a dataset of children's free-living activities, demonstrating significant improvement over existing methods in plain vision language models and object detection models. Results supported the promise of this monitoring approach, which could optimize behavioral research on screen exposure in children's naturalistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepa...</summary><p>Prepare for submission</p></details> |

However, this framework might suffer from the problem of posterior collapse when applied to time series. In this paper, we first show that posterior collapse will reduce latent diffusion to a variational autoencoder (VAE), making it less expressive. This highlights the importance of addressing this issue. We then introduce a principled method: dependency measure, that quantifies the sensitivity of a recurrent decoder to input variables. Using this tool, we confirm that posterior collapse significantly affects time-series latent diffusion on real datasets, and a phenomenon termed dependency illusion is also discovered in the case of shuffled time series. Finally, building on our theoretical and empirical studies, we introduce a new framework that extends latent diffusion and has a stable posterior. Extensive experiments on multiple real time-series datasets show that our new framework is free from posterior collapse and significantly outperforms previous baselines in time series synthesis.</p></details> | Paper under review |
| **[Simplified Mamba with Disentangled Dependency Encoding for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12068v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning have led to the development of numerous models for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). However, most approaches still struggle to comprehensively capture reliable and informative dependencies inherent in time series data. In this paper, we identify and formally define three critical dependencies essential for improving forecasting accuracy: the order dependency and semantic dependency in the time dimension as well as cross-variate dependency in the variate dimension. Despite their significance, these dependencies are rarely considered holistically in existing models. Moreover, improper handling of these dependencies can introduce harmful noise that significantly impairs forecasting performance. To address these challenges, we explore the potential of Mamba for LTSF, highlighting its three key advantages to capture three dependencies, respectively. We further empirically observe that nonlinear activation functions used in vanilla Mamba are redundant for semantically sparse time series data. Therefore, we propose SAMBA, a Simplified Mamba with disentangled dependency encoding. Specifically, we first eliminate the nonlinearity of vanilla Mamba to make it more suitable for LTSF. Along this line, we propose a disentangled dependency encoding strategy to endow Mamba with efficient cross-variate dependency modeling capability while minimizing the interference between time and variate dimensions. We also provide rigorous theory as a justification for our design. Extensive experiments on nine real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SAMBA over state-of-the-art forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

Unlike recent rasterization based approach by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), our primitive based representation allows for exact volume rendering, rather than alpha compositing 3D Gaussian billboards. As such, unlike 3DGS our formulation does not suffer from popping artifacts and view dependent density, but still achieves frame rates of $\sim\!30$ FPS at 720p on an NVIDIA RTX4090. Since our approach is built upon ray tracing it enables effects such as defocus blur and camera distortion (e.g. such as from fisheye cameras), which are difficult to achieve by rasterization. We show that our method is more accurate with fewer blending issues than 3DGS and follow-up work on view-consistent rendering, especially on the challenging large-scale scenes from the Zip-NeRF dataset where it achieves sharpest results among real-time techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://half-potato.gitlab.io/posts/ever</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Test-Time Adaptation with State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12492v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model on test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most test-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts, leaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus on distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the wild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we propose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to temporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers time-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head. Through experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that our method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisionTS: Visual Masked Autoencoders Are Free-Lunch Zero-Shot Time Series Forecasters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17253v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have emerged as a promising approach in time series forecasting (TSF). Existing approaches either repurpose large language models (LLMs) or build large-scale time series datasets to develop TSF foundation models for universal forecasting. However, these methods face challenges due to the severe cross-domain gap or in-domain heterogeneity. This paper explores a new road to building a TSF foundation model from rich, high-quality natural images. Our key insight is that a visual masked autoencoder, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, can naturally be a numeric series forecaster. By reformulating TSF as an image reconstruction task, we bridge the gap between image pre-training and TSF downstream tasks. Surprisingly, without further adaptation in the time-series domain, the proposed VisionTS could achieve superior zero-shot forecasting performance compared to existing TSF foundation models. With fine-tuning for one epoch, VisionTS could further improve the forecasting and achieve state-of-the-art performance in most cases. Extensive experiments reveal intrinsic similarities between images and real-world time series, suggesting visual models may offer a ``free lunch'' for TSF and highlight the potential for future cross-modality research. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Keytoyze/VisionTS.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: a...</summary><p>v2: add more experiments</p></details> |

Our results include a dimension-free CSS for log-concave random vectors, a dimension-free CSS for sub-Gaussian random vectors, and CSSs for sub-$\psi$ random vectors (which includes sub-gamma, sub-Poisson, and sub-exponential distributions). For sub-Gaussian distributions we also provide a CSS which tracks a time-varying mean, generalizing Robbins' mixture approach to the multivariate setting. Finally, we provide several CSSs for heavy-tailed random vectors (two moments only). Our bounds hold under a martingale assumption on the mean and do not require that the observations be iid. Our work is based on PAC-Bayesian theory and inspired by an approach of Catoni and Giulini.</p></details> | 41 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Test Time Learning for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14012v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series forecasting has seen significant advancements with the introduction of token prediction mechanisms such as multi-head attention. However, these methods often struggle to achieve the same performance as in language modeling, primarily due to the quadratic computational cost and the complexity of capturing long-range dependencies in time-series data. State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba, have shown promise in addressing these challenges by offering efficient solutions with linear RNNs capable of modeling long sequences with larger context windows. However, there remains room for improvement in accuracy and scalability. We propose the use of Test-Time Training (TTT) modules in a parallel architecture to enhance performance in long-term time series forecasting. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that TTT modules consistently outperform state-of-the-art models, including the Mamba-based TimeMachine, particularly in scenarios involving extended sequence and prediction lengths. Our results show significant improvements in Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), especially on larger datasets such as Electricity, Traffic, and Weather, underscoring the effectiveness of TTT in capturing long-range dependencies. Additionally, we explore various convolutional architectures within the TTT framework, showing that even simple configurations like 1D convolution with small filters can achieve competitive results. This work sets a new benchmark for time-series forecasting and lays the groundwork for future research in scalable, high-performance forecasting models.</p></details> |  |

In such games, an efficient NE is defined as the maximizer of the potential function. Previous literature provides asymptotic convergence rates to efficient Nash equilibria, and existing finite-time rates are limited to potential games with further assumptions such as the interchangeability of players. In this paper, we prove the first finite-time convergence to an $\epsilon$-efficient NE in general potential games. Our bounds depend polynomially on $1/\epsilon$, an improvement over previous bounds that are exponential in $1/\epsilon$ and only hold for subclasses of potential games. We then strengthen our convergence result in two directions: first, we show that a variant of log-linear learning that requires a factor $A$ less feedback on the utility per round enjoys a similar convergence time; second, we demonstrate the robustness of our convergence guarantee if log-linear learning is subject to small perturbations such as alterations in the learning rule or noise-corrupted utilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 ma...</summary><p>12 main pages, 33 pages, 2 figures, 1 Table</p></details> |
| **[Time-Dependent VAE for Building Latent Representations from Visual Neural Activity with Complex Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07908v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seeking high-quality representations with latent variable models (LVMs) to reveal the intrinsic correlation between neural activity and behavior or sensory stimuli has attracted much interest. Most work has focused on analyzing motor neural activity that controls clear behavioral traces and has modeled neural temporal relationships in a way that does not conform to natural reality. For studies of visual brain regions, naturalistic visual stimuli are high-dimensional and time-dependent, making neural activity exhibit intricate dynamics. To cope with such conditions, we propose Time-Dependent Split VAE (TiDeSPL-VAE), a sequential LVM that decomposes visual neural activity into two latent representations while considering time dependence. We specify content latent representations corresponding to the component of neural activity driven by the current visual stimulus, and style latent representations corresponding to the neural dynamics influenced by the organism's internal state. To progressively generate the two latent representations over time, we introduce state factors to construct conditional distributions with time dependence and apply self-supervised contrastive learning to shape them. By this means, TiDeSPL-VAE can effectively analyze complex visual neural activity and model temporal relationships in a natural way. We compare our model with alternative approaches on synthetic data and neural data from the mouse visual cortex. The results show that our model not only yields the best decoding performance on naturalistic scenes/movies but also extracts explicit neural dynamics, demonstrating that it builds latent representations more relevant to visual stimuli.</p></details> |  |

Current methods that rely on self-supervision and entropy minimization underperform when the self-supervised learning (SSL) task does not align well with the primary objective. Additionally, minimizing entropy can lead to suboptimal solutions when there is limited diversity within minibatches. This paper introduces a meta-learning minimax framework for test-time training on batch normalization (BN) layers, ensuring that the SSL task aligns with the primary task while addressing minibatch overfitting. We adopt a mixed-BN approach that interpolates current test batch statistics with the statistics from source domains and propose a stochastic domain synthesizing method to improve model generalization and robustness to domain shifts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art techniques across various domain adaptation and generalization benchmarks, significantly enhancing the pre-trained model's robustness on unseen domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

The full execution-time opacity is defined as the problem in which an attacker must never be able to deduce whether some private location was visited, by only observing the execution time. The problem of full ET-opacity emptiness (i.e., the emptiness over the parameter valuations for which full execution-time opacity is satisfied) is known to be undecidable for general PTAs. We therefore focus here on one-clock PTAs with integer-valued parameters over dense time. We show that the full ET-opacity emptiness is undecidable for a sufficiently large number of parameters, but is decidable for a single parameter, and exact synthesis can be effectively achieved. Our proofs rely on a novel construction as well as on variants of Presburger arithmetics. We finally prove an additional decidability result on an existential variant of execution-time opacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author (and extended) version of the manuscript of the same name published in the proceedings of the 44th IARCS Annual Conference on Foundations of Software Technology and Theoretical Computer Science (FSTTCS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Statistics With Unknown Truncation, Polynomial Time Algorithms, Beyond Gaussians](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01656v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the estimation of distributional parameters when samples are shown only if they fall in some unknown set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$. Kontonis, Tzamos, and Zampetakis (FOCS'19) gave a $d^{\mathrm{poly}(1/\varepsilon)}$ time algorithm for finding $\varepsilon$-accurate parameters for the special case of Gaussian distributions with diagonal covariance matrix. Recently, Diakonikolas, Kane, Pittas, and Zarifis (COLT'24) showed that this exponential dependence on $1/\varepsilon$ is necessary even when $S$ belongs to some well-behaved classes. These works leave the following open problems which we address in this work: Can we estimate the parameters of any Gaussian or even extend beyond Gaussians? Can we design $\mathrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ time algorithms when $S$ is a simple set such as a halfspace? We make progress on both of these questions by providing the following results: 1. Toward the first question, we give a $d^{\mathrm{poly}(\ell/\varepsilon)}$ time algorithm for any exponential family that satisfies some structural assumptions and any unknown set $S$ that is $\varepsilon$-approximable by degree-$\ell$ polynomials. This result has two important applications: 1a) The first algorithm for estimating arbitrary Gaussian distributions from samples truncated to an unknown $S$; and 1b) The first algorithm for linear regression with unknown truncation and Gaussian features. 2. To address the second question, we provide an algorithm with runtime $\mathrm{poly}(d/\varepsilon)$ that works for a set of exponential families (containing all Gaussians) when $S$ is a halfspace or an axis-aligned rectangle. Along the way, we develop tools that may be of independent interest, including, a reduction from PAC learning with positive and unlabeled samples to PAC learning with positive and negative samples that is robust to certain covariate shifts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 65th IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science (FOCS), 2024; abstract shortened for arXiv</p></details> |

The objective is to estimate the on- and off-time distributions while only observing the aggregate number of edges. This inverse problem is dealt with, in a parametric context, by setting up an estimator based on the method of moments. We provide conditions under which the estimator is asymptotically normal, and we point out how the corresponding covariance matrix can be identified. It is also demonstrated how to adapt the estimation procedure if alternative subgraph counts are observed, such as the number of wedges or triangles.</p></details> |  |
| **[NuwaTS: a Foundation Model Mending Every Incomplete Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15317v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series imputation is critical for many real-world applications and has been widely studied. However, existing models often require specialized designs tailored to specific missing patterns, variables, or domains which limits their generalizability. In addition, current evaluation frameworks primarily focus on domain-specific tasks and often rely on time-wise train/validation/test data splits, which fail to rigorously assess a model's ability to generalize across unseen variables or domains. In this paper, we present \textbf{NuwaTS}, a novel framework that repurposes Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for general time series imputation. Once trained, NuwaTS can be applied to impute missing data across any domain. We introduce specialized embeddings for each sub-series patch, capturing information about the patch, its missing data patterns, and its statistical characteristics. By combining contrastive learning with the imputation task, we train PLMs to create a versatile, one-for-all imputation model. Additionally, we employ a plug-and-play fine-tuning approach, enabling efficient adaptation to domain-specific tasks with minimal adjustments. To evaluate cross-variable and cross-domain generalization, we propose a new benchmarking protocol that partitions the datasets along the variable dimension. Experimental results on over seventeen million time series samples from diverse domains demonstrate that NuwaTS outperforms state-of-the-art domain-specific models across various datasets under the proposed benchmarking protocol. Furthermore, we show that NuwaTS generalizes to other time series tasks, such as forecasting. Our codes are available at https://github.com/Chengyui/NuwaTS.</p></details> | 25 pages, 14 figures |

| **[PASS:Test-Time Prompting to Adapt Styles and Semantic Shapes in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01573v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising paradigm to handle the domain shifts at test time for medical images from different institutions without using extra training data. However, existing TTA solutions for segmentation tasks suffer from (1) dependency on modifying the source training stage and access to source priors or (2) lack of emphasis on shape-related semantic knowledge that is crucial for segmentation tasks.Recent research on visual prompt learning achieves source-relaxed adaptation by extended parameter space but still neglects the full utilization of semantic features, thus motivating our work on knowledge-enriched deep prompt learning. Beyond the general concern of image style shifts, we reveal that shape variability is another crucial factor causing the performance drop. To address this issue, we propose a TTA framework called PASS (Prompting to Adapt Styles and Semantic shapes), which jointly learns two types of prompts: the input-space prompt to reformulate the style of the test image to fit into the pretrained model and the semantic-aware prompts to bridge high-level shape discrepancy across domains. Instead of naively imposing a fixed prompt, we introduce an input decorator to generate the self-regulating visual prompt conditioned on the input data. To retrieve the knowledge representations and customize target-specific shape prompts for each test sample, we propose a cross-attention prompt modulator, which performs interaction between target representations and an enriched shape prompt bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of PASS over state-of-the-art methods on multiple medical image segmentation datasets.

Leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), CaRtGS achieves superior rendering quality and processing speed, which is crucial for scene photorealistic reconstruction. Our approach tackles computational misalignment in Gaussian Splatting SLAM (GS-SLAM) through an adaptive strategy that optimizes training, addresses long-tail optimization, and refines densification. Experiments on Replica and TUM-RGBD datasets demonstrate CaRtGS's effectiveness in achieving high-fidelity rendering with fewer Gaussian primitives.

Conventional Channel-Dependent (CD) models handle these dependencies separately, limiting their ability to model complex interactions such as lead-lag dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose TiVaT (Time-Variable Transformer), a novel architecture that integrates temporal and variate dependencies through its Joint-Axis (JA) attention mechanism. TiVaT's ability to capture intricate variate-temporal dependencies, including asynchronous interactions, is further enhanced by the incorporation of Distance-aware Time-Variable (DTV) Sampling, which reduces noise and improves accuracy through a learned 2D map that focuses on key interactions. TiVaT effectively models both temporal and variate dependencies, consistently delivering strong performance across diverse datasets. Notably, it excels in capturing complex patterns within multivariate time series, enabling it to surpass or remain competitive with state-of-the-art methods. This positions TiVaT as a new benchmark in MTS forecasting, particularly in handling datasets characterized by intricate and challenging dependencies.</p></details> | 15pages, 5 figures |
| **[Global Scheduling of Weakly-Hard Real-Time Tasks using Job-Level Priority Classes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01528v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time systems are intrinsic components of many pivotal applications, such as self-driving vehicles, aerospace and defense systems. The trend in these applications is to incorporate multiple tasks onto fewer, more powerful hardware platforms, e.g., multi-core systems, mainly for reducing cost and power consumption. Many real-time tasks, like control tasks, can tolerate occasional deadline misses due to robust algorithms. These tasks can be modeled using the weakly-hard model. Literature shows that leveraging the weakly-hard model can relax the over-provisioning associated with designed real-time systems. However, a wide-range of the research focuses on single-core platforms. Therefore, we strive to extend the state-of-the-art of scheduling weakly-hard real-time tasks to multi-core platforms. We present a global job-level fixed priority scheduling algorithm together with its schedulability analysis. The scheduling algorithm leverages the tolerable continuous deadline misses to assigning priorities to jobs. The proposed analysis extends the Response Time Analysis (RTA) for global scheduling to test the schedulability of tasks. Hence, our analysis scales with the number of tasks and number of cores because, unlike literature, it depends neither on Integer Linear Programming nor reachability trees. Schedulability analyses show that the schedulability ratio is improved by 40% comparing to the global Rate Monotonic (RM) scheduling and up to 60% more than the global EDF scheduling, which are the state-of-the-art schedulers on the RTEMS real-time operating system. Our evaluation on industrial embedded multi-core platform running RTEMS shows that the scheduling overhead of our proposal does not exceed 60 Nanosecond.</p></details> |  |

However, for low-latency speech processing systems, high efficiency is equally important. Therefore, we propose a speech separation model with significantly reduced parameters and computational costs: Time-frequency Interleaved Gain Extraction and Reconstruction network (TIGER). TIGER leverages prior knowledge to divide frequency bands and compresses frequency information. We employ a multi-scale selective attention module to extract contextual features, while introducing a full-frequency-frame attention module to capture both temporal and frequency contextual information. Additionally, to more realistically evaluate the performance of speech separation models in complex acoustic environments, we introduce a dataset called EchoSet. This dataset includes noise and more realistic reverberation (e.g., considering object occlusions and material properties), with speech from two speakers overlapping at random proportions. Experimental results showed that models trained on EchoSet had better generalization ability than those trained on other datasets to the data collected in the physical world, which validated the practical value of the EchoSet. On EchoSet and real-world data, TIGER significantly reduces the number of parameters by 94.3% and the MACs by 95.3% while achieving performance surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) model TF-GridNet. This is the first speech separation model with fewer than 1 million parameters that achieves performance comparable to the SOTA model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report, demo page: https://cslikai.cn/TIGER/</p></details> |

However, existing approaches are restricted to dense viewpoint settings, which limits their flexibility in free-viewpoint rendering across a wide range of camera view angle discrepancies. To address this limitation, we propose a real-time pipeline named EVA-Gaussian for 3D human novel view synthesis across diverse camera settings. Specifically, we first introduce an Efficient cross-View Attention (EVA) module to accurately estimate the position of each 3D Gaussian from the source images. Then, we integrate the source images with the estimated Gaussian position map to predict the attributes and feature embeddings of the 3D Gaussians. Moreover, we employ a recurrent feature refiner to correct artifacts caused by geometric errors in position estimation and enhance visual fidelity.To further improve synthesis quality, we incorporate a powerful anchor loss function for both 3D Gaussian attributes and human face landmarks. Experimental results on the THuman2.0 and THumansit datasets showcase the superiority of our EVA-Gaussian approach in rendering quality across diverse camera settings.

However, MPC solvers suffer from a high computational burden that restricts their application to systems with low sampling frequency. This issue is further amplified in nonlinear and constrained systems that require nesting MPC solvers within iterative procedures. In this paper, we address these issues by developing parallel-in-time algorithms for constrained nonlinear optimization problems that take advantage of massively parallel hardware to achieve logarithmic computational time scaling over the planning horizon. We develop time-parallel second-order solvers based on interior point methods and the alternating direction method of multipliers, leveraging fast convergence and lower computational cost per iteration. The parallelization is based on a reformulation of the subproblems in terms of associative operations that can be parallelized using the associative scan algorithm. We validate our approach on numerical examples of nonlinear and constrained dynamical systems.</p></details> |  |

Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such as emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this "Inner Monologue" method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech. Our resulting model is the first real-time full-duplex spoken large language model, with a theoretical latency of 160ms, 200ms in practice, and is available at https://github.com/kyutai-labs/moshi.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-MoE: Billion-Scale Time Series Foundation Models with Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16040v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning for time series forecasting has seen significant advancements over the past decades. However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

The Testbed is designed for physical layer research and experimentation following several emerging trends, such as cell-free networking, integrated communication, sensing, open disaggregated Radio Access Networks, AI-Native design, and multiband operation. The software is almost entirely based on free and open-source software, making contributing and reusing any component easy. The open Testbed is designed to provide real-time and labeled data on all parts of the physical layer, from raw IQ data to synchronization statistics, channel state information, or symbol/bit/packet error rates. Real-time labeled datasets can be collected by synchronizing the physical layer data logging with a positioning and motion capture system. One of the main goals of the design is to make it open and accessible to external users remotely. Most tests and data captures can easily be automated, and experiment code can be remotely deployed using standard containers (e.g., Docker or Podman). Finally, the paper describes how the Testbed can be used for our research on joint communication and sensing, over-the-air synchronization, distributed processing, and AI in the loop.</p></details> |  |

Their knowledge is then commonly evaluated using static benchmarks. However, factual knowledge is generally subject to time-sensitive changes, and static benchmarks cannot address those cases. We present an approach to dynamically evaluate the knowledge in LLMs and their time-sensitiveness against Wikidata, a publicly available up-to-date knowledge graph. We evaluate the time-sensitive knowledge in twenty-four private and open-source LLMs, as well as the effectiveness of four editing methods in updating the outdated facts. Our results show that 1) outdatedness is a critical problem across state-of-the-art LLMs; 2) LLMs output inconsistent answers when prompted with slight variations of the question prompt; and 3) the performance of the state-of-the-art knowledge editing algorithms is very limited, as they can not reduce the cases of outdatedness and output inconsistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Alignment of Diffusion Models with Direct Noise Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18881v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we focus on the alignment problem of diffusion models with a continuous reward function, which represents specific objectives for downstream tasks, such as increasing darkness or improving the aesthetics of images. The central goal of the alignment problem is to adjust the distribution learned by diffusion models such that the generated samples maximize the target reward function. We propose a novel alignment approach, named Direct Noise Optimization (DNO), that optimizes the injected noise during the sampling process of diffusion models. By design, DNO operates at inference-time, and thus is tuning-free and prompt-agnostic, with the alignment occurring in an online fashion during generation. We rigorously study the theoretical properties of DNO and also propose variants to deal with non-differentiable reward functions. Furthermore, we identify that naive implementation of DNO occasionally suffers from the out-of-distribution reward hacking problem, where optimized samples have high rewards but are no longer in the support of the pretrained distribution. To remedy this issue, we leverage classical high-dimensional statistics theory to an effective probability regularization technique. We conduct extensive experiments on several important reward functions and demonstrate that the proposed DNO approach can achieve state-of-the-art reward scores within a reasonable time budget for generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[FredNormer: Frequency Domain Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01860v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent normalization-based methods have shown great success in tackling the distribution shift issue, facilitating non-stationary time series forecasting. Since these methods operate in the time domain, they may fail to fully capture the dynamic patterns that are more apparent in the frequency domain, leading to suboptimal results. This paper first theoretically analyzes how normalization methods affect frequency components. We prove that the current normalization methods that operate in the time domain uniformly scale non-zero frequencies, and thus, they struggle to determine components that contribute to more robust forecasting. Therefore, we propose FredNormer, which observes datasets from a frequency perspective and adaptively up-weights the key frequency components. To this end, FredNormer consists of two components: a statistical metric that normalizes the input samples based on their frequency stability and a learnable weighting layer that adjusts stability and introduces sample-specific variations. Notably, FredNormer is a plug-and-play module, which does not compromise the efficiency compared to existing normalization methods. Extensive experiments show that FredNormer improves the averaged MSE of backbone forecasting models by 33.3% and 55.3% on the ETTm2 dataset. Compared to the baseline normalization methods, FredNormer achieves 18 top-1 results and 6 top-2 results out of 28 settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Inference-time Category-wise Safety Steering for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01174v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have seen unprecedented advancements in capabilities and applications across a variety of use-cases, safety alignment of these models is still an area of active research. The fragile nature of LLMs, even models that have undergone extensive alignment and safety training regimes, warrants additional safety steering steps via training-free, inference-time methods. While recent work in the area of mechanistic interpretability has investigated how activations in latent representation spaces may encode concepts, and thereafter performed representation engineering to induce such concepts in LLM outputs, the applicability of such for safety is relatively under-explored. Unlike recent inference-time safety steering works, in this paper we explore safety steering of LLM outputs using: (i) category-specific steering vectors, thereby enabling fine-grained control over the steering, and (ii) sophisticated methods for extracting informative steering vectors for more effective safety steering while retaining quality of the generated text. We demonstrate our exploration on multiple LLMs and datasets, and showcase the effectiveness of the proposed steering method, along with a discussion on the implications and best practices.</p></details> |  |

Yet, in real-life circumstances, individuals do not continuously generate text or voice their opinions. For instance, consumers pen product reviews after weighing the merits and demerits of a product, and professional analysts issue reports following significant news releases. In essence, opinion expression is typically prompted by particular reasons or signals. Despite long-standing developments in opinion mining, the appropriate timing for expressing an opinion remains largely unexplored. To address this deficit, our study introduces an innovative task - the identification of news-triggered opinion expressing timing. We ground this task in the actions of professional stock analysts and develop a novel dataset for investigation. Our approach is decision-focused, leveraging text generation models to steer the classification model, thus enhancing overall performance. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the text generated by our model contributes fresh insights from various angles, effectively aiding in identifying the optimal timing for opinion expression.</p></details> |  |
| **[KS+: Predicting Workflow Task Memory Usage Over Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12290v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific workflow management systems enable the reproducible execution of data analysis pipelines on cluster infrastructures managed by resource managers such as Kubernetes, Slurm, or HTCondor. These resource managers require resource estimates for each workflow task to be executed on one of the cluster nodes. However, task resource consumption varies significantly between different tasks and for the same task with different inputs. Furthermore, resource consumption also fluctuates during a task's execution. As a result, manually configuring static memory allocations is error-prone, often leading users to overestimate memory usage to avoid costly failures from under-provisioning, which results in significant memory wastage. We propose KS+, a method that predicts a task's memory consumption over time depending on its inputs. For this, KS+ dynamically segments the task execution and predicts the memory required for each segment. Our experimental evaluation shows an average reduction in memory wastage of 38% compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art baseline for two real-world workflows from the popular nf-core repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted in 2024 IEEE ReWorDS, eScience</p></details> |

These incidents can escalate over time, resulting in breakdowns, downtime, and safety risks. Fortunately, PD activities emit radio frequency (RF) signals, allowing for the development of a hardware platform for real-time, non-invasive PD detection and monitoring. The system uses an RF antenna and high-speed data acquisition to scan signals across a configurable frequency range (100MHz to 3GHz), utilizing intermediate frequency modulation and sliding frequency windows for detailed analysis. When signals exceed a threshold, the system records the events, capturing both raw signal data and spectrum snapshots. Real-time data is streamed to a cloud server, offering remote access through a dedicated smartphone application, enabling maintenance teams to monitor and respond promptly. Laboratory testing has confirmed the system's ability to accurately capture RF signals and provide real-time PD monitoring, enhancing the reliability and safety of high-speed rail infrastructure.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Introduction to Deep Survival Analysis Models for Predicting Time-to-Event Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01086v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications involve reasoning about time durations before a critical event happens--also called time-to-event outcomes. When will a customer cancel a subscription, a coma patient wake up, or a convicted criminal reoffend? Time-to-event outcomes have been studied extensively within the field of survival analysis primarily by the statistical, medical, and reliability engineering communities, with textbooks already available in the 1970s and '80s. This monograph aims to provide a reasonably self-contained modern introduction to survival analysis. We focus on predicting time-to-event outcomes at the individual data point level with the help of neural networks. Our goal is to provide the reader with a working understanding of precisely what the basic time-to-event prediction problem is, how it differs from standard regression and classification, and how key "design patterns" have been used time after time to derive new time-to-event prediction models, from classical methods like the Cox proportional hazards model to modern deep learning approaches such as deep kernel Kaplan-Meier estimators and neural ordinary differential equation models. We further delve into two extensions of the basic time-to-event prediction setup: predicting which of several critical events will happen first along with the time until this earliest event happens (the competing risks setting), and predicting time-to-event outcomes given a time series that grows in length over time (the dynamic setting). We conclude with a discussion of a variety of topics such as fairness, causal reasoning, interpretability, and statistical guarantees. Our monograph comes with an accompanying code repository that implements every model and evaluation metric that we cover in detail.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/georgehc/survival-intro</p></details> |

This encourages the deep net to learn higher-level representations. Contrary to this motivation, we hypothesize that the discarded activations are useful and can be incorporated on the fly to improve models' prediction. To validate our hypothesis, we propose a search and aggregate method to find useful activation maps to be used at test time. We applied our approach to the task of image classification and semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments over nine different architectures on multiple datasets show that our method consistently improves model test-time performance, complementing existing test-time augmentation techniques.

Focusing on a basin, which is a geologically and economically distinct drilling region, we model the production level of wells grouped by area and time, using priors as regulators of inferences. Our model accounts for area-level and time-level variations as well as well-level variations, incorporating lateral length, water usage, and sand usage. The Maidenhead Coordinate System is used to define uniform (small) geographic areas, many of which contain only a small number of wells in a given time period. The Bayesian small-area model is first built and checked, using data from the Eagle Ford region, covering the years 2014 to 2019. The model is expanded to accommodate temporal dynamics by introducing time-effect components, allowing for the analysis of production trends over times. We explore the impact of technological advancements by modeling water-sand intensity as a proxy for production efficiency. The Bayesian multilevel modeling provides robust and flexible tools for understanding oil and gas production at area and time levels, offering valuable insights for energy production prediction and management.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 2 charts, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Cascading Network for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12240v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of continual test-time adaption where the goal is to adapt a source pre-trained model to a sequence of unlabelled target domains at test time. Existing methods on test-time training suffer from several limitations: (1) Mismatch between the feature extractor and classifier; (2) Interference between the main and self-supervised tasks; (3) Lack of the ability to quickly adapt to the current distribution. In light of these challenges, we propose a cascading paradigm that simultaneously updates the feature extractor and classifier at test time, mitigating the mismatch between them and enabling long-term model adaptation. The pre-training of our model is structured within a meta-learning framework, thereby minimizing the interference between the main and self-supervised tasks and encouraging fast adaptation in the presence of limited unlabelled data. Additionally, we introduce innovative evaluation metrics, average accuracy and forward transfer, to effectively measure the model's adaptation capabilities in dynamic, real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our approach in a range of tasks including image classification, text classification, and speech recognition.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to existing benchmarks that focus on visual quality and textual relevance of generated videos, ChronoMagic-Bench focuses on the model's ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence. The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text query. For these purposes, ChronoMagic-Bench introduces 1,649 prompts and real-world videos as references, categorized into four major types of time-lapse videos: biological, human-created, meteorological, and physical phenomena, which are further divided into 75 subcategories. This categorization comprehensively evaluates the model's capacity to handle diverse and complex transformations. To accurately align human preference with the benchmark, we introduce two new automatic metrics, MTScore and CHScore, to evaluate the videos' metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence. MTScore measures the metamorphic amplitude, reflecting the degree of change over time, while CHScore assesses the temporal coherence, ensuring the generated videos maintain logical progression and continuity. Based on ChronoMagic-Bench, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of ten representative T2V models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different categories of prompts, and providing a thorough evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in video generation research. Moreover, we create a large-scale ChronoMagic-Pro dataset, containing 460k high-quality pairs of 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions ensuring high physical pertinence and large metamorphic amplitude.

As a result, both academia and industry are gradually shifting their attention towards the more complex challenges posed by understanding long-form videos. However, is this really the case? Our studies indicate that LMMs still lack many fundamental reasoning capabilities even when dealing with short videos. We introduce Vinoground, a temporal counterfactual LMM evaluation benchmark encompassing 1000 short and natural video-caption pairs. We demonstrate that existing LMMs severely struggle to distinguish temporal differences between different actions and object transformations. For example, the best model GPT-4o only obtains ~50% on our text and video scores, showing a large gap compared to the human baseline of ~90%. All open-source multimodal models and CLIP-based models perform much worse, producing mostly random chance performance. Through this work, we shed light onto the fact that temporal reasoning in short videos is a problem yet to be fully solved. The dataset and evaluation code are available at https://vinoground.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://vinoground.github.io</p></details> |

Like single-camera multiple-object tracking, it is commonly formulated as a graph problem of tracking-by-detection. Within this framework, existing online methods usually consist of two-stage procedures that cluster temporally first, then spatially, or vice versa. This is computationally expensive and prone to error accumulation. We introduce a graph representation that allows spatial-temporal clustering in a single, combined step: New detections are spatially and temporally connected with existing clusters. By keeping sparse appearance and positional cues of all detections in a cluster, our method can compare clusters based on the strongest available evidence. The final tracks are obtained online using a simple multicut assignment procedure. Our method does not require any training on the target scene, pre-extraction of single-camera tracks, or additional annotations. Notably, we outperform the online state-of-the-art on the CityFlow dataset in terms of IDF1 by more than 14%, and on the Synthehicle dataset by more than 25%, respectively. The code is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

Our goal is to reduce the amount of information transmitted from the distributed agents to the parameter server by exploiting temporal correlation in the local gradients. We use a linear predictor that \textit{combines past gradients to form a prediction of the current gradient}, with coefficients that are optimized by solving a least-square problem. In each iteration, every agent transmits the predictor coefficients to the server such that the predicted local gradient can be computed. The difference between the true local gradient and the predicted one, termed the \textit{prediction residual, is only transmitted when its norm is above some threshold.} When this additional communication step is omitted, the server uses the prediction as the estimated gradient. This proposed design shows notable performance gains compared to existing methods in the literature, achieving convergence with reduced communication costs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, presented at the 60th Allerton conference on Communication, Control, and Computing</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Meets Options: Hierarchical Generative Skill Composition for Temporally-Extended Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02389v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe and successful deployment of robots requires not only the ability to generate complex plans but also the capacity to frequently replan and correct execution errors. This paper addresses the challenge of long-horizon trajectory planning under temporally extended objectives in a receding horizon manner. To this end, we propose DOPPLER, a data-driven hierarchical framework that generates and updates plans based on instruction specified by linear temporal logic (LTL). Our method decomposes temporal tasks into chain of options with hierarchical reinforcement learning from offline non-expert datasets. It leverages diffusion models to generate options with low-level actions. We devise a determinantal-guided posterior sampling technique during batch generation, which improves the speed and diversity of diffusion generated options, leading to more efficient querying. Experiments on robot navigation and manipulation tasks demonstrate that DOPPLER can generate sequences of trajectories that progressively satisfy the specified formulae for obstacle avoidance and sequential visitation.

| **[Efficient Temporal Extrapolation of Multimodal Large Language Models with Temporal Grounding Bridge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16050v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite progress in multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the challenge of interpreting long-form videos in response to linguistic queries persists, largely due to the inefficiency in temporal grounding and limited pre-trained context window size. In this work, we introduce Temporal Grounding Bridge (TGB), a novel framework that bootstraps MLLMs with advanced temporal grounding capabilities and broadens their contextual scope. Our framework significantly enhances the temporal capabilities of current MLLMs through three key innovations: an efficient multi-span temporal grounding algorithm applied to low-dimension temporal features projected from flow; a multimodal length extrapolation training paradigm that utilizes low-dimension temporal features to extend the training context window size; and a bootstrapping framework that bridges our model with pluggable MLLMs without requiring annotation. We validate TGB across seven video benchmarks and demonstrate substantial performance improvements compared with prior MLLMs. Notably, our model, initially trained on sequences of four frames, effectively handles sequences up to 16 longer without sacrificing performance, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

We propose Contrastive Long-form Language-Audio Pretraining (\textbf{CoLLAP}) to significantly extend the perception window for both the input audio (up to 5 minutes) and the language descriptions (exceeding 250 words), while enabling contrastive learning across modalities and temporal dynamics. Leveraging recent Music-LLMs to generate long-form music captions for full-length songs, augmented with musical temporal structures, we collect 51.3K audio-text pairs derived from the large-scale AudioSet training dataset, where the average audio length reaches 288 seconds. We propose a novel contrastive learning architecture that fuses language representations with structured audio representations by segmenting each song into clips and extracting their embeddings. With an attention mechanism, we capture multimodal temporal correlations, allowing the model to automatically weigh and enhance the final fusion score for improved contrastive alignment. Finally, we develop two variants of the CoLLAP model with different types of backbone language models. Through comprehensive experiments on multiple long-form music-text retrieval datasets, we demonstrate consistent performance improvement in retrieval accuracy compared with baselines. We also show the pretrained CoLLAP models can be transferred to various music information retrieval tasks, with heterogeneous long-form multimodal contexts.</p></details> | 4 pages |

This framework incorporates two key innovations: (1) a redundant video feature removal module that filters out unnecessary visual information, and (2) a temporal-aware masking strategy that leverages temporal context for enhanced audio generation accuracy. In contrast to existing resource-heavy Unet-based models, MDSGen employs denoising masked diffusion transformers, facilitating efficient generation without reliance on pre-trained diffusion models. Evaluated on the benchmark VGGSound dataset, our smallest model (5M parameters) achieves 97.9% alignment accuracy, using 172x fewer parameters, 371% less memory, and offering 36x faster inference than the current 860M-parameter state-of-the-art model (93.9% accuracy). The larger model (131M parameters) reaches nearly 99% accuracy while requiring 6.5x fewer parameters. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 21 pages, 16 figures |
| **[HyperBrain: Anomaly Detection for Temporal Hypergraph Brain Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02087v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying unusual brain activity is a crucial task in neuroscience research, as it aids in the early detection of brain disorders. It is common to represent brain networks as graphs, and researchers have developed various graph-based machine learning methods for analyzing them. However, the majority of existing graph learning tools for the brain face a combination of the following three key limitations. First, they focus only on pairwise correlations between regions of the brain, limiting their ability to capture synchronized activity among larger groups of regions. Second, they model the brain network as a static network, overlooking the temporal changes in the brain. Third, most are designed only for classifying brain networks as healthy or disordered, lacking the ability to identify abnormal brain activity patterns linked to biomarkers associated with disorders. To address these issues, we present HyperBrain, an unsupervised anomaly detection framework for temporal hypergraph brain networks. HyperBrain models fMRI time series data as temporal hypergraphs capturing dynamic higher-order interactions. It then uses a novel customized temporal walk (BrainWalk) and neural encodings to detect abnormal co-activations among brain regions. We evaluate the performance of HyperBrain in both synthetic and real-world settings for Autism Spectrum Disorder and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder(ADHD). HyperBrain outperforms all other baselines on detecting abnormal co-activations in brain networks. Furthermore, results obtained from HyperBrain are consistent with clinical research on these brain disorders. Our findings suggest that learning temporal and higher-order connections in the brain provides a promising approach to uncover intricate connectivity patterns in brain networks, offering improved diagnosis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Temporal Decorrelation of State Estimates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02065v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many commercial and defense applications involve multisensor, multitarget tracking, requiring the fusion of information from a set of sensors. An interesting use case occurs when data available at a central node (due to geometric diversity or retrodiction) allows for the tailoring of state estimation for a target. For instance, if a target is initially tracked with a maneuvering target filter, yet the target is clearly not maneuvering in retrospect, it would be beneficial at the fusion node to refilter that data with a non-maneuvering target filter. If measurements can be shared to the central node, the refiltering process can be accomplished by simply passing source measurements through an updated state estimation process. It is often the case for large, distributed systems, however, that only track information can be passed to a fusion center. In this circumstance, refiltering data becomes less straightforward as track states are linearly dependent across time, and the correlation needs to be properly accounted for before/during refiltering. In this work, a model-based temporal decorrelation process for state estimates with process noise will be studied. A decorrelation procedure will be presented based on a linear algebraic formulation of the problem, and process noise estimates will be created that ensure a conservative system state estimate. Numerical examples will be given to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPP-LLM: Modeling Temporal Point Processes by Efficiently Fine-Tuning Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02062v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal point processes (TPPs) are widely used to model the timing and occurrence of events in domains such as social networks, transportation systems, and e-commerce. In this paper, we introduce TPP-LLM, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with TPPs to capture both the semantic and temporal aspects of event sequences. Unlike traditional methods that rely on categorical event type representations, TPP-LLM directly utilizes the textual descriptions of event types, enabling the model to capture rich semantic information embedded in the text. While LLMs excel at understanding event semantics, they are less adept at capturing temporal patterns. To address this, TPP-LLM incorporates temporal embeddings and employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to effectively learn temporal dynamics without extensive retraining. This approach improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that TPP-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sequence modeling and event prediction, highlighting the benefits of combining LLMs with TPPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engagement Measurement Based on Facial Landmarks and Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17175v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engagement in virtual learning is crucial for a variety of factors including student satisfaction, performance, and compliance with learning programs, but measuring it is a challenging task. There is therefore considerable interest in utilizing artificial intelligence and affective computing to measure engagement in natural settings as well as on a large scale. This paper introduces a novel, privacy-preserving method for engagement measurement from videos. It uses facial landmarks, which carry no personally identifiable information, extracted from videos via the MediaPipe deep learning solution. The extracted facial landmarks are fed to Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (ST-GCNs) to output the engagement level of the student in the video. To integrate the ordinal nature of the engagement variable into the training process, ST-GCNs undergo training in a novel ordinal learning framework based on transfer learning. Experimental results on two video student engagement measurement datasets show the superiority of the proposed method compared to previous methods with improved state-of-the-art on the EngageNet dataset with a 3.1% improvement in four-class engagement level classification accuracy and on the Online Student Engagement dataset with a 1.5% improvement in binary engagement classification accuracy. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was applied to the developed ST-GCNs to interpret the engagement measurements obtained by the proposed method in both the spatial and temporal domains. The relatively lightweight and fast ST-GCN and its integration with the real-time MediaPipe make the proposed approach capable of being deployed on virtual learning platforms and measuring engagement in real-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Test-Time Adaptation with State-Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12492v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shifts between training and test data are inevitable over the lifecycle of a deployed model, leading to performance decay. Adapting a model on test samples can help mitigate this drop in performance. However, most test-time adaptation methods have focused on synthetic corruption shifts, leaving a variety of distribution shifts underexplored. In this paper, we focus on distribution shifts that evolve gradually over time, which are common in the wild but challenging for existing methods, as we show. To address this, we propose STAD, a probabilistic state-space model that adapts a deployed model to temporal distribution shifts by learning the time-varying dynamics in the last set of hidden features. Without requiring labels, our model infers time-evolving class prototypes that act as a dynamic classification head. Through experiments on real-world temporal distribution shifts, we show that our method excels in handling small batch sizes and label shift.</p></details> |  |

After at least 25 years since its discovery, we are finally able to provide a long-awaited almost sure convergence analysis. Namely, we are the first to prove that, under very mild conditions, tabular average reward TD converges almost surely to a sample path dependent fixed point. Key to this success is a new general stochastic approximation result concerning nonexpansive mappings with Markovian and additive noise, built on recent advances in stochastic Krasnoselskii-Mann iterations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Graph Representation Learning via Edge Temporal States Modeling and Structure-reinforced Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10079v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph representation learning has emerged as a crucial research area, driven by the growing need for analyzing time-evolving graph data in real-world applications. While recent approaches leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown promise, they often fail to adequately capture the impact of temporal edge states on inter-node relationships, consequently overlooking the dynamic changes in node features induced by these evolving relationships. Furthermore, these methods suffer from GNNs' inherent over-smoothing problem, which hinders the extraction of global structural features. To address these challenges, we introduce the Recurrent Structure-reinforced Graph Transformer (RSGT), a novel framework for dynamic graph representation learning. It first designs a heuristic method to explicitly model edge temporal states by employing different edge types and weights based on the differences between consecutive snapshots, thereby integrating varying edge temporal states into the graph's topological structure. We then propose a structure-reinforced graph transformer that captures temporal node representations encoding both graph topology and evolving dynamics through a recurrent learning paradigm, enabling the extraction of both local and global structural features. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate RSGT's superior performance in discrete dynamic graph representation learning, consistently outperforming existing methods in dynamic link prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the Elsevier for possible publication.

| **[Exploring Scalability of Self-Training for Open-Vocabulary Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07024v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vocabulary size in temporal action localization (TAL) is limited by the scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets. To overcome this, recent works integrate vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, for open-vocabulary TAL (OV-TAL). However, despite the success of VLMs trained on extensive datasets, existing OV-TAL methods still rely on human-labeled TAL datasets of limited size to train action localizers, limiting their generalizability. In this paper, we explore the scalability of self-training with unlabeled YouTube videos for OV-TAL. Our approach consists of two stages: (1) a class-agnostic action localizer is trained on a human-labeled TAL dataset to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled videos, and (2) the large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset is then used to train the localizer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that leveraging web-scale videos in self-training significantly enhances the generalizability of an action localizer. Additionally, we identify limitations in existing OV-TAL evaluation schemes and propose a new benchmark for thorough assessment. Finally, we showcase the TAL performance of the large multimodal model Gemini-1.5 on our new benchmark. Code is released at https://github.com/HYUNJS/STOV-TAL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Autoencoders Reveal Temporal Difference Learning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01280v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning, the ability to adapt based on a few examples in the input prompt, is a ubiquitous feature of large language models (LLMs). However, as LLMs' in-context learning abilities continue to improve, understanding this phenomenon mechanistically becomes increasingly important. In particular, it is not well-understood how LLMs learn to solve specific classes of problems, such as reinforcement learning (RL) problems, in-context. Through three different tasks, we first show that Llama $3$ $70$B can solve simple RL problems in-context. We then analyze the residual stream of Llama using Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and find representations that closely match temporal difference (TD) errors. Notably, these representations emerge despite the model only being trained to predict the next token. We verify that these representations are indeed causally involved in the computation of TD errors and $Q$-values by performing carefully designed interventions on them. Taken together, our work establishes a methodology for studying and manipulating in-context learning with SAEs, paving the way for a more mechanistic understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning methods often rely on simplistic assumptions, typically including a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors. Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control settings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty, we enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive experimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the consistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance improvements.</p></details> |  |

TAVRNN captures temporal changes in network structure by modeling sequential snapshots of neuronal activity, enabling the identification of key connectivity patterns. Leveraging temporal attention mechanisms and variational graph techniques, TAVRNN uncovers how connectivity shifts align with behavior over time. We validate TAVRNN on two datasets: in vivo calcium imaging data from freely behaving rats and novel in vitro electrophysiological data from the DishBrain system, where biological neurons control a simulated environment during the game of pong. We show that TAVRNN outperforms previous baseline models in classification, clustering tasks and computational efficiency while accurately linking connectivity changes to performance variations. Crucially, TAVRNN reveals that high game performance in the DishBrain system correlates with the alignment of sensory and motor subregion channels, a relationship not evident in earlier models. This framework represents the first application of dynamic graph representation of electrophysiological (neuronal) data from DishBrain system, providing insights into the reorganization of neuronal networks during learning. TAVRNN's ability to differentiate between neuronal states associated with successful and unsuccessful learning outcomes, offers significant implications for real-time monitoring and manipulation of biological neuronal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 6 figures, 4 supplemental figures, 4 tables, 8 supplemental tables</p></details> |
| **[Arges: Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Ulcerative Colitis Severity Assessment in Endoscopy Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00536v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of disease severity from endoscopy videos in ulcerative colitis (UC) is crucial for evaluating drug efficacy in clinical trials. Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |
| **[Class-Agnostic Visio-Temporal Scene Sketch Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00266v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene sketch semantic segmentation is a crucial task for various applications including sketch-to-image retrieval and scene understanding. Existing sketch segmentation methods treat sketches as bitmap images, leading to the loss of temporal order among strokes due to the shift from vector to image format. Moreover, these methods struggle to segment objects from categories absent in the training data. In this paper, we propose a Class-Agnostic Visio-Temporal Network (CAVT) for scene sketch semantic segmentation. CAVT employs a class-agnostic object detector to detect individual objects in a scene and groups the strokes of instances through its post-processing module. This is the first approach that performs segmentation at both the instance and stroke levels within scene sketches. Furthermore, there is a lack of free-hand scene sketch datasets with both instance and stroke-level class annotations. To fill this gap, we collected the largest Free-hand Instance- and Stroke-level Scene Sketch Dataset (FrISS) that contains 1K scene sketches and covers 403 object classes with dense annotations. Extensive experiments on FrISS and other datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method over state-of-the-art scene sketch segmentation models. The code and dataset will be made public after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, long video understanding presents unique challenges due to the complexity of reasoning over extended timespans, even for zero-shot LLM-based approaches. The challenge of information redundancy in long videos prompts the question of what specific information is essential for large language models (LLMs) and how to leverage them for complex spatial-temporal reasoning in long-form video analysis. We propose a framework VideoINSTA, i.e. INformative Spatial-TemporAl Reasoning for zero-shot long-form video understanding. VideoINSTA contributes (1) a zero-shot framework for long video understanding using LLMs; (2) an event-based temporal reasoning and content-based spatial reasoning approach for LLMs to reason over spatial-temporal information in videos; (3) a self-reflective information reasoning scheme balancing temporal factors based on information sufficiency and prediction confidence. Our model significantly improves the state-of-the-art on three long video question-answering benchmarks: EgoSchema, NextQA, and IntentQA, and the open question answering dataset ActivityNetQA.

In this work, we focus on generating long-horizon trajectories that adhere to novel static and temporally-extended constraints/instructions at test time. We propose a data-driven diffusion-based framework, LTLDoG, that modifies the inference steps of the reverse process given an instruction specified using finite linear temporal logic ($\text{LTL}_f$). LTLDoG leverages a satisfaction value function on $\text{LTL}_f$ and guides the sampling steps using its gradient field. This value function can also be trained to generalize to new instructions not observed during training, enabling flexible test-time adaptability. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation illustrate that the method is able to generate trajectories that satisfy formulae that specify obstacle avoidance and visitation sequences.

| **[WeakSurg: Weakly supervised surgical instrument segmentation using temporal equivariance and semantic continuity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09551v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For robotic surgical videos, instrument presence annotations are typically recorded with video streams, which offering the potential to reduce the manually annotated costs for segmentation. However, weakly supervised surgical instrument segmentation with only instrument presence labels has been rarely explored in surgical domain due to the highly under-constrained challenges. Temporal properties can enhance representation learning by capturing sequential dependencies and patterns over time even in incomplete supervision situations. From this, we take the inherent temporal attributes of surgical video into account and extend a two-stage weakly supervised segmentation paradigm from different perspectives. Firstly, we make temporal equivariance constraint to enhance pixel-wise temporal consistency between adjacent features. Secondly, we constrain class-aware semantic continuity between global and local regions across temporal dimension. Finally, we generate temporal-enhanced pseudo masks from consecutive frames to suppress irrelevant regions. Extensive experiments are validated on two surgical video datasets, including one cholecystectomy surgery benchmark and one real robotic left lateral segment liver surgery dataset. We annotate instance-wise instrument labels with fixed time-steps which are double checked by a clinician with 3-years experience to evaluate segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performances of our method, which consistently achieves comparable or favorable results with previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSdetector: Temporal-Spatial Self-correction Collaborative Learning for Colonoscopy Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19983v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CNN-based object detection models that strike a balance between performance and speed have been gradually used in polyp detection tasks. Nevertheless, accurately locating polyps within complex colonoscopy video scenes remains challenging since existing methods ignore two key issues: intra-sequence distribution heterogeneity and precision-confidence discrepancy. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Temporal-Spatial self-correction detector (TSdetector), which first integrates temporal-level consistency learning and spatial-level reliability learning to detect objects continuously. Technically, we first propose a global temporal-aware convolution, assembling the preceding information to dynamically guide the current convolution kernel to focus on global features between sequences. In addition, we designed a hierarchical queue integration mechanism to combine multi-temporal features through a progressive accumulation manner, fully leveraging contextual consistency information together with retaining long-sequence-dependency features. Meanwhile, at the spatial level, we advance a position-aware clustering to explore the spatial relationships among candidate boxes for recalibrating prediction confidence adaptively, thus eliminating redundant bounding boxes efficiently. The experimental results on three publicly available polyp video dataset show that TSdetector achieves the highest polyp detection rate and outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

| **[LACOSTE: Exploiting stereo and temporal contexts for surgical instrument segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09360v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surgical instrument segmentation is instrumental to minimally invasive surgeries and related applications. Most previous methods formulate this task as single-frame-based instance segmentation while ignoring the natural temporal and stereo attributes of a surgical video. As a result, these methods are less robust against the appearance variation through temporal motion and view change. In this work, we propose a novel LACOSTE model that exploits Location-Agnostic COntexts in Stereo and TEmporal images for improved surgical instrument segmentation. Leveraging a query-based segmentation model as core, we design three performance-enhancing modules. Firstly, we design a disparity-guided feature propagation module to enhance depth-aware features explicitly. To generalize well for even only a monocular video, we apply a pseudo stereo scheme to generate complementary right images. Secondly, we propose a stereo-temporal set classifier, which aggregates stereo-temporal contexts in a universal way for making a consolidated prediction and mitigates transient failures. Finally, we propose a location-agnostic classifier to decouple the location bias from mask prediction and enhance the feature semantics. We extensively validate our approach on three public surgical video datasets, including two benchmarks from EndoVis Challenges and one real radical prostatectomy surgery dataset GraSP. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performances of our method, which consistently achieves comparable or favorable results with previous state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Medical Image Analysis</p></details> |
| **[Towards Unifying Diffusion Models for Probabilistic Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17360v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal graph learning is a fundamental problem in modern urban systems. Existing approaches tackle different tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs misalign with the current research efforts toward unifying spatio-temporal graph learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model these tasks in a unified probabilistic perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared dependencies. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly under the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising decoders that are task-specific. The encoder, optimized by pre-training strategies, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The decoders, utilizing attention mechanisms, generate predictions by leveraging learned patterns. Opting for forecasting and kriging, the decoders are designed as Spatial Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions. Combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic decoders, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both deterministic and probabilistic baselines, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the success of the transformer architecture, the spiking transformer architecture is explored to scale up dataset size and performance. However, existing works only consider the spatial self-attention in spiking transformer, neglecting the inherent temporal context across the timesteps. In this work, we introduce Spiking Transformer with Spatial-Temporal Attention (STAtten), a simple and straightforward architecture designed to integrate spatial and temporal information in self-attention with negligible additional computational load. The STAtten divides the temporal or token index and calculates the self-attention in a cross-manner to effectively incorporate spatial-temporal information. We first verify our spatial-temporal attention mechanism's ability to capture long-term temporal dependencies using sequential datasets. Moreover, we validate our approach through extensive experiments on varied datasets, including CIFAR10/100, ImageNet, CIFAR10-DVS, and N-Caltech101. Notably, our cross-attention mechanism achieves an accuracy of 78.39 % on the ImageNet dataset.</p></details> |  |

However, current large language models still have limited sensitivity to temporal information and their inadequate temporal reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that enhances temporal awareness and reasoning through Temporal Information-Aware Embedding and Granular Contrastive Reinforcement Learning. Experimental results on four TSQA datasets demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms existing LLMs in TSQA tasks, marking a step forward in bridging the performance gap between machine and human temporal understanding and reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

While SFUDA is well-developed in visual tasks, its application to Time-Series SFUDA (TS-SFUDA) remains limited due to the challenge of transferring crucial temporal dependencies across domains. Although a few researchers begin to explore this area, they rely on specific source domain designs, which are impractical as source data owners cannot be expected to follow particular pretraining protocols. To solve this, we propose Temporal Source Recovery (TemSR), a framework that transfers temporal dependencies for effective TS-SFUDA without requiring source-specific designs. TemSR features a recovery process that leverages masking, recovery, and optimization to generate a source-like distribution with recovered source temporal dependencies. To ensure effective recovery, we further design segment-based regularization to restore local dependencies and anchor-based recovery diversity maximization to enhance the diversity of the source-like distribution. The source-like distribution is then adapted to the target domain using traditional UDA techniques. Extensive experiments across multiple TS tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of TemSR, even surpassing existing TS-SFUDA method that requires source domain designs. Code is available in https://github.com/Frank-Wang-oss/TemSR.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%.

The champion solution from last year's first competition has explored the TSL by fusing audio and video modalities with the same weight. Considering the TSL task aims to localize sound events, we conduct relevant experiments that demonstrated the superiority of sound features (Section 3). Based on our findings, to enhance audio modality features, we employ various models to extract audio features, such as InterVideo, CaVMAE, and VideoMAE models. Our approach ranks first in the final test with a score of 0.4925.</p></details> |  |
| **[STTM: A New Approach Based Spatial-Temporal Transformer And Memory Network For Real-time Pressure Signal In On-demand Food Delivery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00057v1)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-demand Food Delivery (OFD) services have become very common around the world. For example, on the Ele.me platform, users place more than 15 million food orders every day. Predicting the Real-time Pressure Signal (RPS) is crucial for OFD services, as it is primarily used to measure the current status of pressure on the logistics system. When RPS rises, the pressure increases, and the platform needs to quickly take measures to prevent the logistics system from being overloaded. Usually, the average delivery time for all orders within a business district is used to represent RPS. Existing research on OFD services primarily focuses on predicting the delivery time of orders, while relatively less attention has been given to the study of the RPS. Previous research directly applies general models such as DeepFM, RNN, and GNN for prediction, but fails to adequately utilize the unique temporal and spatial characteristics of OFD services, and faces issues with insufficient sensitivity during sudden severe weather conditions or peak periods. To address these problems, this paper proposes a new method based on Spatio-Temporal Transformer and Memory Network (STTM). Specifically, we use a novel Spatio-Temporal Transformer structure to learn logistics features across temporal and spatial dimensions and encode the historical information of a business district and its neighbors, thereby learning both temporal and spatial information. Additionally, a Memory Network is employed to increase sensitivity to abnormal events. Experimental results on the real-world dataset show that STTM significantly outperforms previous methods in both offline experiments and the online A/B test, demonstrating the effectiveness of this method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining in Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05042v2)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data from various domains is continuously growing, and extracting and analyzing temporal patterns within these series can provide valuable insights. Temporal pattern mining (TPM) extends traditional pattern mining by incorporating event time intervals into patterns, making them more expressive but also increasing the computational complexity in terms of time and space. One important type of temporal pattern is the rare temporal pattern (RTP), which occurs infrequently but with high confidence. Mining these rare patterns poses several challenges, for example, the low support threshold can lead to a combinatorial explosion and the generation of many irrelevant patterns. To address this, an efficient approach to mine rare temporal patterns is essential. This paper introduces the Rare Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (RTPMfTS) method, designed to discover rare temporal patterns. The key contributions of this work are as follows: (1) An end-to-end RTPMfTS process that takes time series data as input and outputs rare temporal patterns. (2) A highly efficient Rare Temporal Pattern Mining (RTPM) algorithm, which leverages optimized data structures for fast event and pattern retrieval, as well as effective pruning techniques to accelerate the mining process. (3) A comprehensive experimental evaluation of RTPM, demonstrating that it outperforms the baseline in both runtime and memory efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2306.10994</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Consistency of Data and Information in Cyber-Physical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19309v1)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a large cyber-physical system, a temporal inconsistency of an output value can arise if there is a non-negligible delay between the instant when a sensor value is acquired from the environment and the instant when a setpoint, based on this sensor value, is used in the environment. Such a temporal inconsistency can be the cause of a critical malfunction of the cyber-physical system. This paper presents a solution of this temporal consistency problem that can best be implemented in a time-triggered architecture (TTA). In a TTA, the instants of sensor value acquisition, setpoint calculation, and actuation on the environment are statically configured, and the cyber-physical system implements software and hardware mechanisms to execute the respective actions tightly at these configured instants.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Existing studies often rely on outdated lexicons that do not capture the evolving nature of in-group language, nor the social structure of the community. This paper proposes a novel method for inducing in-group lexicons which incorporates its socio-temporal context. Using dynamic word and user embeddings trained on conversations from online anti-women communities, our approach outperforms prior methods for lexicon induction. We provide a new lexicon of manosphere terms, validated by human experts, which quantifies the relevance of each term to a specific sub-community. We present novel insights on in-group language which illustrate the utility of this approach.</p></details> |  |

FLINT can flexibly handle different types of scenarios with (1) a flow field being partially available for some members (e.g., omitted due to space constraints) or (2) no flow field being available at all (e.g., because it could not be acquired during an experiment). The design of our architecture allows to flexibly cater to both cases simply by adapting our modular loss functions, effectively treating the different scenarios as flow-supervised and flow-unsupervised problems, respectively (with respect to the presence or absence of ground-truth flow). To the best of our knowledge, FLINT is the first approach to perform flow estimation from scientific ensembles, generating a corresponding flow field for each discrete timestep, even in the absence of original flow information. Additionally, FLINT produces high-quality temporal interpolants between scalar fields. FLINT employs several neural blocks, each featuring several convolutional and deconvolutional layers. We demonstrate performance and accuracy for different usage scenarios with scientific ensembles from both simulations and experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages (with Appendix), 17 figures</p></details> |
| **[Optimization-based Task and Motion Planning under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications using Logic Network Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19168v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes an optimization-based task and motion planning framework, named ``Logic Network Flow", to integrate signal temporal logic (STL) specifications into efficient mixed-binary linear programmings. In this framework, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron constraints on each edge of the network flow, instead of as constraints between the nodes as in the traditional Logic Tree formulation. Synthesized with Dynamic Network Flows, Logic Network Flows render a tighter convex relaxation compared to Logic Trees derived from these STL specifications. Our formulation is evaluated on several multi-robot motion planning case studies. Empirical results demonstrate that our formulation outperforms Logic Tree formulation in terms of computation time for several planning problems. As the problem size scales up, our method still discovers better lower and upper bounds by exploring fewer number of nodes during the branch-and-bound process, although this comes at the cost of increased computational load for each node when exploring branches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signal Temporal Logic Planning with Time-Varying Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19131v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter aims to generate a continuous-time trajectory consisting of piecewise B\'ezier curves that satisfy signal temporal logic (STL) specifications with piecewise time-varying robustness. Our time-varying robustness is less conservative than the real-valued robustness, which enables more effective tracking in practical applications. Specifically, our continuous-time trajectories account for dynamic feasibility, leading to smaller tracking errors and ensuring that the STL specifications can be met by the tracking trajectory. Comparative experiments demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal queries for dynamic temporal forests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18750v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a temporal forest each edge has an associated set of time labels that specify the time instants in which the edges are available. A temporal path from vertex $u$ to vertex $v$ in the forest is a selection of a label for each edge in the unique path from $u$ to $v$, assuming it exists, such that the labels selected for any two consecutive edges are non-decreasing. We design linear-size data structures that maintain a temporal forest of rooted trees under addition and deletion of both edge labels and singleton vertices, insertion of root-to-node edges, and removal of edges with no labels. Such data structures can answer temporal reachability, earliest arrival, and latest departure queries. All queries and updates are handled in polylogarithmic worst-case time. Our results can be adapted to deal with latencies. More precisely, all the worst-case time bounds are asymptotically unaffected when latencies are uniform. For arbitrary latencies, the update time becomes amortized in the incremental case where only label additions and edge/singleton insertions are allowed as well as in the decremental case in which only label deletions and edge/singleton removals are allowed. To the best of our knowledge, the only previously known data structure supporting temporal reachability queries is due to Brito, Albertini, Casteigts, and Traven\c{c}olo [Social Network Analysis and Mining, 2021], which can handle general temporal graphs, answers queries in logarithmic time in the worst case, but requires an amortized update time that is quadratic in the number of vertices, up to polylogarithmic factors.</p></details> | ISAAC 2024 |

Ensuring that such models verify some temporal properties requires to use something beyond simulation. In this work we use the model checker Uppaal to verify a class of recurrent quantitative temporal properties appearing in RT-DEVS models. Secondly, by introducing mutations to quantitative temporal properties we are able to find errors in RT-DEVS models and their implementations. A case study from the railway domain is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synchronous Team Semantics for Temporal Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18667v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present team semantics for two of the most important linear and branching time specification languages, Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Computation Tree Logic (CTL). With team semantics, LTL is able to express hyperproperties, which have in the last decade been identified as a key concept in the verification of information flow properties. We study basic properties of the logic and classify the computational complexity of its satisfiability, path, and model checking problem. Further, we examine how extensions of the basic logic react to adding additional atomic operators. Finally, we compare its expressivity to the one of HyperLTL, another recently introduced logic for hyperproperties. Our results show that LTL with team semantics is a viable alternative to HyperLTL, which complements the expressivity of HyperLTL and has partially better algorithmic properties. For CTL with team semantics, we investigate the computational complexity of the satisfiability and model checking problem. The satisfiability problem is shown to be EXPTIME-complete while we show that model checking is PSPACE-complete.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this by integrating two diffusion models: a Latent Image Diffusion Model (LIDM) trained on images and a Latent Video Diffusion Model (LVDM) trained on video data. Our method combines these models in the reverse diffusion process, where the LIDM enhances image quality and the LVDM ensures temporal consistency. This unique combination allows us to effectively handle the complex spatio-temporal dynamics in video generation. Our results demonstrate quantitative and qualitative improvements in producing realistic and coherent videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[TemporalPaD: a reinforcement-learning framework for temporal feature representation and dimension reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18597v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in feature representation and dimension reduction have highlighted their crucial role in enhancing the efficacy of predictive modeling. This work introduces TemporalPaD, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework designed for temporal pattern datasets. TemporalPaD integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with neural networks to achieve concurrent feature representation and feature reduction. The framework consists of three cooperative modules: a Policy Module, a Representation Module, and a Classification Module, structured based on the Actor-Critic (AC) framework. The Policy Module, responsible for dimensionality reduction through RL, functions as the actor, while the Representation Module for feature extraction and the Classification Module collectively serve as the critic. We comprehensively evaluate TemporalPaD using 29 UCI datasets, a well-known benchmark for validating feature reduction algorithms, through 10 independent tests and 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, given that TemporalPaD is specifically designed for time series data, we apply it to a real-world DNA classification problem involving enhancer category and enhancer strength. The results demonstrate that TemporalPaD is an efficient and effective framework for achieving feature reduction, applicable to both structured data and sequence datasets. The source code of the proposed TemporalPaD is freely available as supplementary material to this article and at http://www.healthinformaticslab.org/supp/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompt-Driven Temporal Domain Adaptation for Nighttime UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18533v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nighttime UAV tracking under low-illuminated scenarios has achieved great progress by domain adaptation (DA). However, previous DA training-based works are deficient in narrowing the discrepancy of temporal contexts for UAV trackers. To address the issue, this work proposes a prompt-driven temporal domain adaptation training framework to fully utilize temporal contexts for challenging nighttime UAV tracking, i.e., TDA. Specifically, the proposed framework aligns the distribution of temporal contexts from daytime and nighttime domains by training the temporal feature generator against the discriminator. The temporal-consistent discriminator progressively extracts shared domain-specific features to generate coherent domain discrimination results in the time series. Additionally, to obtain high-quality training samples, a prompt-driven object miner is employed to precisely locate objects in unannotated nighttime videos. Moreover, a new benchmark for long-term nighttime UAV tracking is constructed. Exhaustive evaluations on both public and self-constructed nighttime benchmarks demonstrate the remarkable performance of the tracker trained in TDA framework, i.e., TDA-Track. Real-world tests at nighttime also show its practicality. The code and demo videos are available at https://github.com/vision4robotics/TDA-Track.</p></details> | Accepted by IROS2024 |
| **[Temporal2Seq: A Unified Framework for Temporal Video Understanding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18478v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of video understanding, there is a proliferation of tasks for clip-level temporal video analysis, including temporal action detection (TAD), temporal action segmentation (TAS), and generic event boundary detection (GEBD). While task-specific video understanding models have exhibited outstanding performance in each task, there remains a dearth of a unified framework capable of simultaneously addressing multiple tasks, which is a promising direction for the next generation of AI. To this end, in this paper, we propose a single unified framework, coined as Temporal2Seq, to formulate the output of these temporal video understanding tasks as a sequence of discrete tokens. With this unified token representation, Temporal2Seq can train a generalist model within a single architecture on different video understanding tasks. In the absence of multi-task learning (MTL) benchmarks, we compile a comprehensive co-training dataset by borrowing the datasets from TAD, TAS, and GEBD tasks. We evaluate our Temporal2Seq generalist model on the corresponding test sets of three tasks, demonstrating that Temporal2Seq can produce reasonable results on various tasks and achieve advantages compared with single-task training on this framework. We also investigate the generalization performance of our generalist model on new datasets from different tasks, which yields superior performance to the specific model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Query matching for spatio-temporal action detection with query-based object detector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18408v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a method that extends the query-based object detection model, DETR, to spatio-temporal action detection, which requires maintaining temporal consistency in videos. Our proposed method applies DETR to each frame and uses feature shift to incorporate temporal information. However, DETR's object queries in each frame may correspond to different objects, making a simple feature shift ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose query matching across different frames, ensuring that queries for the same object are matched and used for the feature shift. Experimental results show that performance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features are shifted using the proposed query matching.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Dynamical Operator: Continuous Spatial-Temporal Model with Gradient-Based and Derivative-Free Optimization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11798v4)** | 2024-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven modeling techniques have been explored in the spatial-temporal modeling of complex dynamical systems for many engineering applications. However, a systematic approach is still lacking to leverage the information from different types of data, e.g., with different spatial and temporal resolutions, and the combined use of short-term trajectories and long-term statistics. In this work, we build on the recent progress of neural operator and present a data-driven modeling framework called neural dynamical operator that is continuous in both space and time. A key feature of the neural dynamical operator is the resolution-invariance with respect to both spatial and temporal discretizations, without demanding abundant training data in different temporal resolutions. To improve the long-term performance of the calibrated model, we further propose a hybrid optimization scheme that leverages both gradient-based and derivative-free optimization methods and efficiently trains on both short-term time series and long-term statistics. We investigate the performance of the neural dynamical operator with three numerical examples, including the viscous Burgers' equation, the Navier-Stokes equations, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. The results confirm the resolution-invariance of the proposed modeling framework and also demonstrate stable long-term simulations with only short-term time series data. In addition, we show that the proposed model can better predict long-term statistics via the hybrid optimization scheme with a combined use of short-term and long-term data.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

We fine-tune Temporal Adapters for Llama 3 8B on full timelines from a panel of British Twitter users, and extract longitudinal aggregates of emotions and attitudes with established questionnaires. We validate our estimates against representative British survey data and find strong positive, significant correlations for several collective emotions. The obtained estimates are robust across multiple training seeds and prompt formulations, and in line with collective emotions extracted using a traditional classification model trained on labeled data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend the analysis of affect in LLMs to a longitudinal setting through Temporal Adapters. Our work enables new approaches towards the longitudinal analysis of social media data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/dess-mannheim/temporal-adapters</p></details> |

However, previous works primarily relied on a single masking criterion, resulting in the model overfitting specific features and overlooking other effective information. In this paper, we introduce a hierarchy and attention guided cross-masking framework (HA-CM) that applies masking to skeleton sequences from both spatial and temporal perspectives. Specifically, in spatial graphs, we utilize hyperbolic space to maintain joint distinctions and effectively preserve the hierarchical structure of high-dimensional skeletons, employing joint hierarchy as the masking criterion. In temporal flows, we substitute traditional distance metrics with the global attention of joints for masking, addressing the convergence of distances in high-dimensional space and the lack of a global perspective. Additionally, we incorporate cross-contrast loss based on the cross-masking framework into the loss function to enhance the model's learning of instance-level features. HA-CM shows efficiency and universality on three public large-scale datasets, NTU-60, NTU-120, and PKU-MMD.

Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception.

This work focuses on temporal hierarchies, such as aggregating monthly time series data to annual data. We explore the impact of various forecast reconciliation methods on temporally aggregated ARIMA models, thereby bridging the fields of hierarchical forecast reconciliation and temporal aggregation both theoretically and experimentally. Our paper is the first to theoretically examine the effects of temporal hierarchical forecast reconciliation, demonstrating that the optimal method aligns with a bottom-up aggregation approach. To assess the practical implications and performance of the reconciled forecasts, we conduct a series of simulation studies, confirming that the findings extend to more complex models. This result helps explain the strong performance of the bottom-up approach observed in many prior studies. Finally, we apply our methods to real data examples, where we observe similar results.</p></details> |  |

Previous methods usually quantize the entire body pose into one code, which not only faces the difficulty in encoding all joints within one vector but also loses the spatial relationship between different joints. Differently, in this work we quantize each individual joint into one vector, which i) simplifies the quantization process as the complexity associated with a single joint is markedly lower than that of the entire pose; ii) maintains a spatial-temporal structure that preserves both the spatial relationships among joints and the temporal movement patterns; iii) yields a 2D token map, which enables the application of various 2D operations widely used in 2D images. Grounded in the 2D motion quantization, we build a spatial-temporal modeling framework, where 2D joint VQVAE, temporal-spatial 2D masking technique, and spatial-temporal 2D attention are proposed to take advantage of spatial-temporal signals among the 2D tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous methods across different datasets, with a $26.6\%$ decrease of FID on HumanML3D and a $29.9\%$ decrease on KIT-ML.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

This paper introduces SEA-ViT, an advanced deep learning model that integrates Vision Transformer (ViT) with bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to capture spatio-temporal covariance for predicting sea surface currents (U, V) using high-frequency radar (HF) data. The name SEA-ViT is derived from ``Sea Surface Currents Forecasting using Vision Transformer,'' highlighting the model's emphasis on ocean dynamics and its use of the ViT architecture to enhance forecasting capabilities. SEA-ViT is designed to unravel complex dependencies by leveraging a rich dataset spanning over 30 years and incorporating ENSO indices (El Ni\~no, La Ni\~na, and neutral phases) to address the intricate relationship between geographic coordinates and climatic variations. This development enhances the predictive capabilities for sea surface currents, supporting the efforts of the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency (GISTDA) in Thailand's maritime regions.

In this paper, we propose a data-driven learning framework, that leverages the predictive and feature extraction capabilities of the mixture models and seq2seq-based neural networks while addressing prevalent challenges caused by error propagation and dimensionality reduction. After training with this framework, the learned model can improve long-step prediction accuracy significantly given the past trajectories and the context information. The accuracy and effectiveness of the approach are evaluated by comparing the predicted trajectories with the ground truth. The results indicate that the proposed method has outperformed the state-of-the-art predicting methods on a terminal airspace flight trajectory dataset. The trajectories generated by the proposed method have a higher temporal resolution(1 timestep per second vs 0.1 timestep per second) and are closer to the ground truth.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AIAA-JAIS</p></details> |
| **[Walker: Self-supervised Multiple Object Tracking by Walking on Temporal Appearance Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17221v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The supervision of state-of-the-art multiple object tracking (MOT) methods requires enormous annotation efforts to provide bounding boxes for all frames of all videos, and instance IDs to associate them through time. To this end, we introduce Walker, the first self-supervised tracker that learns from videos with sparse bounding box annotations, and no tracking labels. First, we design a quasi-dense temporal object appearance graph, and propose a novel multi-positive contrastive objective to optimize random walks on the graph and learn instance similarities. Then, we introduce an algorithm to enforce mutually-exclusive connective properties across instances in the graph, optimizing the learned topology for MOT. At inference time, we propose to associate detected instances to tracklets based on the max-likelihood transition state under motion-constrained bi-directional walks. Walker is the first self-supervised tracker to achieve competitive performance on MOT17, DanceTrack, and BDD100K. Remarkably, our proposal outperforms the previous self-supervised trackers even when drastically reducing the annotation requirements by up to 400x.</p></details> | ECCV 2024 |
| **[Detecting Temporal Ambiguity in Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17046v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting and answering ambiguous questions has been a challenging task in open-domain question answering. Ambiguous questions have different answers depending on their interpretation and can take diverse forms. Temporally ambiguous questions are one of the most common types of such questions. In this paper, we introduce TEMPAMBIQA, a manually annotated temporally ambiguous QA dataset consisting of 8,162 open-domain questions derived from existing datasets. Our annotations focus on capturing temporal ambiguity to study the task of detecting temporally ambiguous questions. We propose a novel approach by using diverse search strategies based on disambiguated versions of the questions. We also introduce and test non-search, competitive baselines for detecting temporal ambiguity using zero-shot and few-shot approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

To exploit event cameras for object/action recognition, existing methods predominantly sample and aggregate events in a second-level duration at every fixed temporal interval (or frequency). However, they often face difficulties in capturing the spatiotemporal relationships for longer, e.g., minute-level, events and generalizing across varying temporal frequencies. To fill the gap, we present a novel framework, dubbed PAST-SSM, exhibiting superior capacity in recognizing events with arbitrary duration (e.g., 0.1s to 4.5s) and generalizing to varying inference frequencies. Our key insight is to learn the spatiotemporal relationships from the encoded event features via the state space model (SSM) -- whose linear complexity makes it ideal for modeling high temporal resolution events with longer sequences. To achieve this goal, we first propose a Path-Adaptive Event Aggregation and Scan (PEAS) module to encode events of varying duration into features with fixed dimensions by adaptively scanning and selecting aggregated event frames. On top of PEAS, we introduce a novel Multi-faceted Selection Guiding (MSG) loss to minimize the randomness and redundancy of the encoded features. This subtly enhances the model generalization across different inference frequencies. Lastly, the SSM is employed to better learn the spatiotemporal properties from the encoded features. Moreover, we build a minute-level event-based recognition dataset, named ArDVS100, with arbitrary duration for the benefit of the community. Extensive experiments prove that our method outperforms prior arts by +3.45%, +0.38% and +8.31% on the DVS Action, SeAct and HARDVS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | First version |

This paper introduces CVT-Occ, a novel approach that leverages temporal fusion through the geometric correspondence of voxels over time to improve the accuracy of 3D occupancy predictions. By sampling points along the line of sight of each voxel and integrating the features of these points from historical frames, we construct a cost volume feature map that refines current volume features for improved prediction outcomes. Our method takes advantage of parallax cues from historical observations and employs a data-driven approach to learn the cost volume. We validate the effectiveness of CVT-Occ through rigorous experiments on the Occ3D-Waymo dataset, where it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D occupancy prediction with minimal additional computational cost.

The aerial agent needs to not only understand tactically evolving maneuvers of fighter jets from a long-term perspective but also react to rapidly changing aerodynamics of aircraft from a short-term viewpoint. In this paper, we introduce TempFuser, a novel long short-term temporal fusion transformer architecture that can learn agile, tactical, and acrobatic flight maneuvers in complex dogfight problems. Our approach integrates two distinct temporal transition embeddings into a transformer-based network to comprehensively capture both the long-term tactics and short-term agility of aerial agents. By incorporating these perspectives, our policy network generates end-to-end flight commands that secure dominant positions over the long term and effectively outmaneuver agile opponents. After training in a high-fidelity flight simulator, our model successfully learns to execute strategic maneuvers, outperforming baseline policy models against various types of opponent aircraft. Notably, our model exhibits human-like acrobatic maneuvers even when facing adversaries with superior specifications, all without relying on prior knowledge. Moreover, it demonstrates robust pursuit performance in challenging supersonic and low-altitude situations.

| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Graph Pruning Based Spatial and Temporal Graph Convolutional Network with Transfer Learning for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16532v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the process of urbanization and the rapid growth of population, the issue of traffic congestion has become an increasingly critical concern. Intelligent transportation systems heavily rely on real-time and precise prediction algorithms to address this problem. While Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) methods in deep learning have demonstrated high accuracy in predicting road conditions when sufficient data is available, forecasting in road networks with limited data remains a challenging task. This study proposed a novel Spatial-temporal Convolutional Network (TL-GPSTGN) based on graph pruning and transfer learning framework to tackle this issue. Firstly, the essential structure and information of the graph are extracted by analyzing the correlation and information entropy of the road network structure and feature data. By utilizing graph pruning techniques, the adjacency matrix of the graph and the input feature data are processed, resulting in a significant improvement in the model's migration performance. Subsequently, the well-characterized data are inputted into the spatial-temporal graph convolutional network to capture the spatial-temporal relationships and make predictions regarding the road conditions. Furthermore, this study conducts comprehensive testing and validation of the TL-GPSTGN method on real datasets, comparing its prediction performance against other commonly used models under identical conditions. The results demonstrate the exceptional predictive accuracy of TL-GPSTGN on a single dataset, as well as its robust migration performance across different datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, accepted by ICIAAI2023, withdrawn from proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Glitch in Time: Exploiting Temporal Misalignment of IMU For Eavesdropping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16438v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of voice assistants and related applications has raised significant concerns about the security of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in smartphones. These devices are vulnerable to acoustic eavesdropping attacks, jeopardizing user privacy. In response, Google imposed a rate limit of 200 Hz on permission-free access to IMUs, aiming to neutralize such side-channel attacks. Our research introduces a novel exploit, STAG, which circumvents these protections. It induces a temporal misalignment between the gyroscope and accelerometer, cleverly combining their data to resample at higher rates and reviving the potential for eavesdropping attacks previously curtailed by Google's security enhancements. Compared to prior methods, STAG achieves an 83.4% reduction in word error rate, highlighting its effectiveness in exploiting IMU data under restricted access and emphasizing the persistent security risks associated with these sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Distillation on Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11798v4)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient real-time traffic prediction is crucial for reducing transportation time. To predict traffic conditions, we employ a spatio-temporal graph neural network (ST-GNN) to model our real-time traffic data as temporal graphs. Despite its capabilities, it often encounters challenges in delivering efficient real-time predictions for real-world traffic data. Recognizing the significance of timely prediction due to the dynamic nature of real-time data, we employ knowledge distillation (KD) as a solution to enhance the execution time of ST-GNNs for traffic prediction. In this paper, We introduce a cost function designed to train a network with fewer parameters (the student) using distilled data from a complex network (the teacher) while maintaining its accuracy close to that of the teacher. We use knowledge distillation, incorporating spatial-temporal correlations from the teacher network to enable the student to learn the complex patterns perceived by the teacher. However, a challenge arises in determining the student network architecture rather than considering it inadvertently. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that utilizes the cost function to calculate pruning scores, addressing small network architecture search issues, and jointly fine-tunes the network resulting from each pruning stage using KD. Ultimately, we evaluate our proposed ideas on two real-world datasets, PeMSD7 and PeMSD8. The results indicate that our method can maintain the student's accuracy close to that of the teacher, even with the retention of only 3% of network parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow to Rare Events: An Application of Normalizing Flow in Temporal Importance Sampling for Automated Vehicle Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07320v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Vehicle (AV) validation based on simulated testing requires unbiased evaluation and high efficiency. One effective solution is to increase the exposure to risky rare events while reweighting the probability measure. However, characterizing the distribution of risky events is particularly challenging due to the paucity of samples and the temporality of continuous scenario variables. To solve it, we devise a method to represent, generate, and reweight the distribution of risky rare events. We decompose the temporal evolution of continuous variables into distribution components based on conditional probability. By introducing the Risk Indicator Function, the distribution of risky rare events is theoretically precipitated out of naturalistic driving distribution. This targeted distribution is practically generated via Normalizing Flow, which achieves exact and tractable probability evaluation of intricate distribution. The rare event distribution is then demonstrated as the advantageous Importance Sampling distribution. We also promote the technique of temporal Importance Sampling. The combined method, named as TrimFlow, is executed to estimate the collision rate of Car-following scenarios as a tentative practice. The results showed that sampling background vehicle maneuvers from rare event distribution could evolve testing scenarios to hazardous states. TrimFlow reduced 86.1% of tests compared to generating testing scenarios according to their exposure in the naturalistic driving environment. In addition, the TrimFlow method is not limited to one specific type of functional scenario.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Mixture-of-Graph-Experts for Multi-Type Crime Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15764v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As various types of crime continue to threaten public safety and economic development, predicting the occurrence of multiple types of crimes becomes increasingly vital for effective prevention measures. Although extensive efforts have been made, most of them overlook the heterogeneity of different crime categories and fail to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution. In this work, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Mixture-of-Graph-Experts (ST-MoGE) framework for collective multiple-type crime prediction. To enhance the model's ability to identify diverse spatial-temporal dependencies and mitigate potential conflicts caused by spatial-temporal heterogeneity of different crime categories, we introduce an attentive-gated Mixture-of-Graph-Experts (MGEs) module to capture the distinctive and shared crime patterns of each crime category. Then, we propose Cross-Expert Contrastive Learning(CECL) to update the MGEs and force each expert to focus on specific pattern modeling, thereby reducing blending and redundancy. Furthermore, to address the issue of imbalanced spatial distribution, we propose a Hierarchical Adaptive Loss Re-weighting (HALR) approach to eliminate biases and insufficient learning of data-scarce regions. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two real-world crime datasets and compare our results with twelve advanced baselines. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer for Stock Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15662v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have achieved significant success in various time series forecasting tasks. However, due to the lack of explicit and fixed spatial relationships in stock prediction tasks, many STGNNs fail to perform effectively in this domain. While some STGNNs learn spatial relationships from time series, they often lack comprehensiveness. Research indicates that modeling time series using feature changes as tokens reveals entirely different information compared to using time steps as tokens. To more comprehensively extract dynamic spatial information from stock data, we propose a Double-Path Adaptive-correlation Spatial-Temporal Inverted Transformer (DPA-STIFormer). DPA-STIFormer models each node via continuous changes in features as tokens and introduces a Double Direction Self-adaptation Fusion mechanism. This mechanism decomposes node encoding into temporal and feature representations, simultaneously extracting different spatial correlations from a double path approach, and proposes a Double-path gating mechanism to fuse these two types of correlation information. Experiments conducted on four stock market datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art results, validating the model's superior capability in uncovering latent temporal-correlation patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critical Node Detection in Temporal Social Networks, Based on Global and Semi-local Centrality Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15142v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nodes that play strategic roles in networks are called critical or influential nodes. For example, in an epidemic, we can control the infection spread by isolating critical nodes; in marketing, we can use certain nodes as the initial spreaders aiming to reach the largest part of the network, or they can be selected for removal in targeted attacks to maximise the fragmentation of the network. In this study, we focus on critical node detection in temporal networks. We propose three new measures to identify the critical nodes in temporal networks: the temporal supracycle ratio, temporal semi-local integration, and temporal semi-local centrality. We analyse the performance of these measures based on their effect on the SIR epidemic model in three scenarios: isolating the influential nodes when an epidemic happens, using the influential nodes as seeds of the epidemic, or removing them to analyse the robustness of the network. We compare the results with existing centrality measures, particularly temporal betweenness, temporal centrality, and temporal degree deviation. The results show that the introduced measures help identify influential nodes more accurately. The proposed methods can be used to detect nodes that need to be isolated to reduce the spread of an epidemic or as initial nodes to speedup dissemination of information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments and criticisms are welcomed</p></details> |

Yet, achieving this objective is a non-trivial task as it involves modeling the knowledge state across multiple knowledge components (KCs) while considering their temporal and relational dynamics during the learning process. Knowledge tracing methods have tackled this task by either modeling KCs' temporal dynamics using recurrent models or relational dynamics across KCs and questions using graph models. Albeit, there is a lack of methods that could learn joint embedding between relational and temporal dynamics of the task. Moreover, many methods that count for the impact of a student's forgetting behavior during the learning process use hand-crafted features, limiting their generalization on different scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel method that jointly models the relational and temporal dynamics of the knowledge state using a deep temporal graph memory network. In addition, we propose a generic technique for representing a student's forgetting behavior using temporal decay constraints on the graph memory module. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using multiple knowledge tracing benchmarks while comparing it to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a challenge to produce temporally aligned audio to synchronize the generated video, considering the complicated semantic information included in the latter. In this work, inspired by the recent success of text-to-audio (TTA) generation, we first investigate the video-to-audio (VTA) generation framework based on latent diffusion model (LDM). Similar to latest pioneering exploration in VTA, our preliminary results also show great potentials of LDM in VTA task, but it still suffers from sub-optimal temporal alignment. To this end, we propose to enhance the temporal alignment of VTA with frame-level semantic information. With the recently popular grounding segment anything model (Grounding SAM), we can extract the fine-grained semantics in video frames to enable VTA to produce better-aligned audio signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our system on both objective and subjective evaluation metrics, which shows both better audio quality and fine-grained temporal alignment.</p></details> |  |

This work extends traditional prediction approaches by focusing on four-dimensional (4D) CSI, which includes predictions over time, bandwidth, and antenna (TX and RX) space. Such a comprehensive framework is essential for addressing the dynamic nature of mobility environments within intelligent transportation systems, necessitating the capture of both temporal and spatial dependencies across diverse domains. To address this complexity, we propose a novel context-conditioned spatiotemporal predictive learning method. This method leverages causal convolutional long short-term memory (CA-ConvLSTM) to effectively capture dependencies within 4D CSI data, and incorporates context-conditioned attention mechanisms to enhance the efficiency of spatiotemporal memory updates. Additionally, we introduce an adaptive meta-learning scheme tailored for recurrent networks to mitigate the issue of accumulative prediction errors. We validate the proposed method through empirical studies conducted across three different geometric configurations and mobility scenarios. Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art predictive models, achieving superior performance across various geometries. Moreover, we show that the meta-learning framework significantly enhances the performance of recurrent-based predictive models in highly challenging cross-geometry settings, thus highlighting its robustness and adaptability.</p></details> |  |

Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Vision-Language Pretrained Models with Temporal-Aware Adaptation for Referring Video Object Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10610v2)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The crux of Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) lies in modeling dense text-video relations to associate abstract linguistic concepts with dynamic visual contents at pixel-level. Current RVOS methods typically use vision and language models pretrained independently as backbones. As images and texts are mapped to uncoupled feature spaces, they face the arduous task of learning Vision-Language (VL) relation modeling from scratch. Witnessing the success of Vision-Language Pretrained (VLP) models, we propose to learn relation modeling for RVOS based on their aligned VL feature space. Nevertheless, transferring VLP models to RVOS is a deceptively challenging task due to the substantial gap between the pretraining task (static image/region-level prediction) and the RVOS task (dynamic pixel-level prediction). To address this transfer challenge, we introduce a framework named VLP-RVOS which harnesses VLP models for RVOS through temporal-aware adaptation. We first propose a temporal-aware prompt-tuning method, which not only adapts pretrained representations for pixel-level prediction but also empowers the vision encoder to model temporal contexts. We further customize a cube-frame attention mechanism for robust spatial-temporal reasoning. Besides, we propose to perform multi-stage VL relation modeling while and after feature extraction for comprehensive VL understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms and exhibits strong generalization abilities.</p></details> |  |

To remedy this issue, we present VITATECS, a diagnostic VIdeo-Text dAtaset for the evaluation of TEmporal Concept underStanding. Specifically, we first introduce a fine-grained taxonomy of temporal concepts in natural language in order to diagnose the capability of VidLMs to comprehend different temporal aspects. Furthermore, to disentangle the correlation between static and temporal information, we generate counterfactual video descriptions that differ from the original one only in the specified temporal aspect. We employ a semi-automatic data collection framework using large language models and human-in-the-loop annotation to obtain high-quality counterfactual descriptions efficiently. Evaluation of representative video-language understanding models confirms their deficiency in temporal understanding, revealing the need for greater emphasis on the temporal elements in video-language research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024. 19 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables.

Recently, significant attempts have been made to benchmark datasets and metrics to evaluate LLMs for these traits. However, structural simplicity (subject-relation-object) and contemporary association in their query formulation limit the broader definition of factuality and consistency. In this study, we introduce TeCFaP, a novel Temporally Consistent Factuality Probe task to expand the consistent factuality probe in the temporal dimension. To this end, we propose TEMP-COFAC, a high-quality dataset of prefix-style English query paraphrases. Subsequently, we extend the definitions of existing metrics to represent consistent factuality across temporal dimension. We experiment with a diverse set of LLMs and find most of them performing poorly on TeCFaP. Next, we propose a novel solution CoTSeLF (Consistent-Time-Sensitive Learning Framework) combining multi-task instruction tuning (MT-IT) with consistent-time-sensitive reinforcement learning (CTSRL) to improve temporally consistent factuality in LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of CoTSeLF over several baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatiotemporal Forecasting of Traffic Flow using Wavelet-based Temporal Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04440v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal forecasting of traffic flow data represents a typical problem in the field of machine learning, impacting urban traffic management systems. In general, spatiotemporal forecasting problems involve complex interactions, nonlinearities, and long-range dependencies due to the interwoven nature of the temporal and spatial dimensions. Due to this, traditional statistical and machine learning methods cannot adequately handle the temporal and spatial dependencies in these complex traffic flow datasets. A prevalent approach in the field combines graph convolutional networks and multi-head attention mechanisms for spatiotemporal processing. This paper proposes a wavelet-based temporal attention model, namely a wavelet-based dynamic spatiotemporal aware graph neural network (W-DSTAGNN), for tackling the traffic forecasting problem. Wavelet decomposition can help by decomposing the signal into components that can be analyzed independently, reducing the impact of non-stationarity and handling long-range dependencies of traffic flow datasets. Benchmark experiments using three popularly used statistical metrics confirm that our proposal efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations and outperforms ten state-of-the-art models (including both temporal and spatiotemporal benchmarks) on three publicly available traffic datasets. Our proposed ensemble method can better handle dynamic temporal and spatial dependencies and make reliable long-term forecasts. In addition to point forecasts, our proposed model can generate interval forecasts that significantly enhance probabilistic forecasting for traffic datasets.</p></details> |  |

Our method relies upon effectively capturing the gradual change in word usage via a bandwidth estimate for the non-parametric Generalized Linear Models (Fan, Heckman, and Wand, 1995). The number of possible rank orders needed to search through for cost functions related to the bandwidth can be quite large, even for a small set of documents. We tackle this problem of combinatorial optimization using the Simulated Annealing algorithm, which allows us to obtain the optimal document temporal orders. Our rank ordering method significantly improved the temporal sequencing of both corpora compared to a randomly sequenced baseline. This unsupervised approach should enable the temporal ordering of undated document sets.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods are limited to highway or highly simplified intersection scenarios due to the intricacy and diversity of traffic scenarios. In response, we propose Traffic Scenario Logic (TSL), which is a spatial-temporal logic designed for modeling and reasoning of urban pedestrian-free traffic scenarios. TSL provides a formal representation of the urban road network that can be derived from OpenDRIVE, i.e., the de facto industry standard of high-definition maps for autonomous driving, enabling the representation of a broad range of traffic scenarios without discretization approximations. We implemented the reasoning of TSL using Telingo, i.e., a solver for temporal programs based on the Answer Set Programming, and tested it on different urban road layouts. Demonstrations show the effectiveness of TSL in test scenario generation and its potential value in areas like decision-making and control verification of autonomous driving. The code for TSL reasoning is opened.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main text, 19 pages of technical appendix</p></details> |

| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remember and Recall: Associative-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02201v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a pivotal component of autonomous driving systems, enabling the application of accumulated movement experience to current scenarios. Although most existing methods concentrate on learning continuous representations to gain valuable experience, they often suffer from computational inefficiencies and struggle with unfamiliar situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fragmented-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction (FMTP) model, inspired by the remarkable learning capabilities of humans, particularly their ability to leverage accumulated experience and recall relevant memories in unfamiliar situations. The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, we design a learnable memory array by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using defined quantization operations during the training phase. This approach further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, we develop an advanced reasoning engine based on language models to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations. Our method has been evaluated on various public datasets, including ETH-UCY, inD, SDD, nuScenes, Waymo, and VTL-TP. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance and extracts more valuable experience from past trajectories to inform the current state.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Irregular Time-Series Representation Learning for Health Trajectory Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02133v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations. This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> |  |

Recently, C-ADMM has been studied in robotics applications such as multi-vehicle target tracking and collaborative manipulation tasks. However, few works have investigated the performance of C-ADMM applied to non-convex problems in robotics applications due to a lack of theoretical guarantees. For this project, we aim to quantitatively explore and examine the convergence behavior of non-convex C-ADMM through the scope of distributed multi-robot trajectory planning. We propose a convex trajectory planning problem by leveraging C-ADMM and Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVCs) to get around the non-convex collision avoidance constraint and compare this convex C-ADMM algorithm to a non-convex C-ADMM baseline with non-convex collision avoidance constraints. We show that the convex C-ADMM algorithm requires 1000 fewer iterations to achieve convergence in a multi-robot waypoint navigation scenario. We also confirm that the non-convex C-ADMM baseline leads to sub-optimal solutions and violation of safety constraints in trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Entropy-Based Uncertainty Modeling for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01628v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, accurate motion prediction is essential for safe and efficient motion planning. To ensure safety, planners must rely on reliable uncertainty information about the predicted future behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. This paper addresses the so-far neglected problem of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction. We adopt a holistic approach that focuses on uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the influence of model composition. Our method is based on a theoretically grounded information-theoretic approach to measure uncertainty, allowing us to decompose total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to assess how different model architectures and configurations affect uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Learning Representations (2025)</p></details> |

In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording. We propose a two-stage process. In the first stage we extract the demonstration trajectory offline. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. In the online trajectory generation stage, we first re-detect all objects, then warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene and execute it on the robot. To complete these steps, our method leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect and quantitatively test on demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios. We make the code publicly available at http://ditto.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted at IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Contact-Implicit Model Predictive Control: Controlling Diverse Quadruped Motions Without Pre-Planned Contact Modes or Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08961v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a contact-implicit model predictive control (MPC) framework for the real-time discovery of multi-contact motions, without predefined contact mode sequences or foothold positions. This approach utilizes the contact-implicit differential dynamic programming (DDP) framework, merging the hard contact model with a linear complementarity constraint. We propose the analytical gradient of the contact impulse based on relaxed complementarity constraints to further the exploration of a variety of contact modes. By leveraging a hard contact model-based simulation and computation of search direction through a smooth gradient, our methodology identifies dynamically feasible state trajectories, control inputs, and contact forces while simultaneously unveiling new contact mode sequences. However, the broadened scope of contact modes does not always ensure real-world applicability. Recognizing this, we implemented differentiable cost terms to guide foot trajectories and make gait patterns. Furthermore, to address the challenge of unstable initial roll-outs in an MPC setting, we employ the multiple shooting variant of DDP. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world demonstrations using a 45 kg HOUND quadruped robot, performing various tasks in simulation and showcasing actual experiments involving a forward trot and a front-leg rearing motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version for The International Journal of Robotics Research (2024); published version at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241273645 / Videos at https://youtu.be/SXD4BJIfyoY</p></details> |
| **[Demystifying Trajectory Recovery From Ash: An Open-Source Evaluation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14645v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Once analysed, location trajectories can provide valuable insights beneficial to various applications. However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN'24).

Multimodal trajectory prediction enhances decision-making by considering multiple possible future trajectories based on diverse sources of environmental data. In this approach, we leverage ResNet-50 to extract image features from high-definition map data and use IMU sensor data to calculate speed, acceleration, and yaw rate. A temporal probabilistic network is employed to compute potential trajectories, selecting the most accurate and highly probable trajectory paths. This method integrates HD map data to improve the robustness and reliability of trajectory predictions for autonomous vehicles.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a preprint of a paper submitted to the 26th Irish Machine Vision and Image Processing Conference (IMVIP 2024).

Computation of this measure of safety is posed as a peak-minimizing optimal control problem.

The crash-safety framework is extended towards data-driven safety analysis by measuring safety as the maximum amount of data corruption required to crash into the unsafe set.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Algorithmic Considerations for Effective Global Search of Robust Low-Thrust Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00297v1)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing interest in the cislunar domain over the past decade has led to an increasing demand for low-thrust missions to key orbits within this region. These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |
| **[CVVLSNet: Vehicle Location and Speed Estimation Using Partial Connected Vehicle Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00132v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time estimation of vehicle locations and speeds is crucial for developing many beneficial transportation applications in traffic management and control, e.g., adaptive signal control. Recent advances in communication technologies facilitate the emergence of connected vehicles (CVs), which can share traffic information with nearby CVs or infrastructures. At the early stage of connectivity, only a portion of vehicles are CVs. The locations and speeds for those non-CVs (NCs) are not accessible and must be estimated to obtain the full traffic information. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a novel CV-based Vehicle Location and Speed estimation network, CVVLSNet, to simultaneously estimate the vehicle locations and speeds exclusively using partial CV trajectory data. A road cell occupancy (RCO) method is first proposed to represent the variable vehicle state information. Spatiotemporal interactions can be integrated by simply fusing the RCO representations. Then, CVVLSNet, taking the Coding-RAte TransformEr (CRATE) network as a backbone, is introduced to estimate the vehicle locations and speeds. Moreover, physical vehicle size constraints are also considered in loss functions. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly outperformed the existing method under various CV penetration rates, signal timings, and volume-to-capacity ratios.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEADS-UP: Head-Mounted Egocentric Dataset for Trajectory Prediction in Blind Assistance Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20324v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce HEADS-UP, the first egocentric dataset collected from head-mounted cameras, designed specifically for trajectory prediction in blind assistance systems. With the growing population of blind and visually impaired individuals, the need for intelligent assistive tools that provide real-time warnings about potential collisions with dynamic obstacles is becoming critical. These systems rely on algorithms capable of predicting the trajectories of moving objects, such as pedestrians, to issue timely hazard alerts. However, existing datasets fail to capture the necessary information from the perspective of a blind individual. To address this gap, HEADS-UP offers a novel dataset focused on trajectory prediction in this context. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a semi-local trajectory prediction approach to assess collision risks between blind individuals and pedestrians in dynamic environments. Unlike conventional methods that separately predict the trajectories of both the blind individual (ego agent) and pedestrians, our approach operates within a semi-local coordinate system, a rotated version of the camera's coordinate system, facilitating the prediction process. We validate our method on the HEADS-UP dataset and implement the proposed solution in ROS, performing real-time tests on an NVIDIA Jetson GPU through a user study. Results from both dataset evaluations and live tests demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In the Violina framework, we optimize the coefficient matrices of state-space model and memory kernel in the given space using a projected gradient descent method so that its model prediction matches the set of multiple observed data. Using Violina we can identify a linear non-Markovian dynamical system with constraints corresponding to a priori knowledge on the model parameters and memory effects. Using synthetic data, we numerically demonstrate that the Markovian and non-Markovian state-space models identified by the proposed method have considerably better generalization performances compared to the models identified by an existing dynamic decomposition-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 18.9% to 23.4%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ACC 2025.

This paper proposes a suboptimal joint trajectory replanning (SJTR) method, which formulates the joint optimization problem of target orbit and flight trajectory after a fault within a convex optimization framework. By incorporating penalty coefficients for terminal constraints, the optimization solution adheres to the orbit redecision principle, thereby avoiding complex decision-making processes and resulting in a concise and rapid solution to the replanning problem. A learning-based warm-start scheme is proposed in conjunction with the designed SJTR method. Offline, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a dataset generated by the SJTR method. Online, the DNN provides initial guesses for the time optimization variables based on the current fault situation, enhancing the solving efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. Numerical simulations of the MAV flight scenario under the thrust drop faults are performed, and Monte Carlo experiments and case studies across all orbit types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted paper on https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/accepted-papers/</p></details> |
| **[Real-time Planning of Minimum-time Trajectories for Agile UAV Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16074v2)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of real-time planning of minimum-time trajectories over multiple waypoints, onboard multirotor UAVs. Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by employing traditional LSTM architectures, but these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in processing large datasets. In response to this challenge, we propose VecLSTM, a novel framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of LSTM-based neural networks. Unlike conventional approaches, VecLSTM incorporates vectorization layers, leveraging optimized mathematical operations to process input sequences more efficiently. We have implemented VecLSTM and incorporated it into the MySQL database. To evaluate the effectiveness of VecLSTM, we compare its performance against a conventional LSTM model using a dataset comprising 1,467,652 samples with seven unique labels. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, with VecLSTM achieving a validation accuracy of 85.57\%, a test accuracy of 85.47\%, and a weighted F1-score of 0.86. Furthermore, VecLSTM significantly reduces training time, offering a 26.2\% reduction compared to traditional LSTM models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Thus, the focus of existing research has been on where a user goes. On the other hand, the study of how a user moves between locations has great potential for new research opportunities. Kinematic features describe how an individual moves between locations and can be used for tasks such as identification of individuals or anomaly detection. Unfortunately, data availability and quality challenges make kinematic trajectory mining difficult. In this paper, we leverage the Geolife dataset of human trajectories to investigate the viability of using kinematic features to identify individuals and detect anomalies. We show that humans have an individual "kinematic profile" which can be used as a strong signal to identify individual humans. We experimentally show that, for the two use-cases of individual identification and anomaly detection, simple kinematic features fed to standard classification and anomaly detection algorithms significantly improve results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline.

Methods for trajectory classification are particularly important to detect different movement patterns, while methods for regression to compute motility metrics and forecasting. Recent advances in computer vision have facilitated the processing of trajectories rendered as images via artificial neural networks with 2d convolutional layers (CNNs). This approach leverages the capability of CNNs to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, necessary to recognize complex shapes. Moreover, it overcomes the limitation of other machine learning methods that require input trajectories with a fixed number of points. However, rendering trajectories as images can introduce poorly investigated artifacts such as information loss due to the plotting of coordinates on a discrete grid, and spectral changes due to line thickness and aliasing. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CNNs for solving classification and regression problems from synthetic trajectories that have been rendered as images using different modalities. The parameters considered in this study include line thickness, image resolution, usage of motion history (color-coding of the temporal component) and anti-aliasing. Results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate image resolution according to model depth and motion history in applications where movement direction is critical.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

This choice enables the development of a Lyapunov-based trajectory controller with guaranteed performance and small computation time. We demonstrate the correctness of our approach with both simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper introduces BoT-Drive, a planning algorithm that addresses uncertainties at both behavior and trajectory levels within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. BoT-Drive employs driver models to characterize unknown behavioral intentions and utilizes their model parameters to infer hidden driving styles. By also treating driver models as decision-making actions for the autonomous vehicle, BoT-Drive effectively tackles the exponential complexity inherent in POMDPs. To enhance safety and robustness, the planner further applies importance sampling to refine the driving trajectory conditioned on the planned high-level behavior. Evaluation on real-world data shows that BoT-Drive consistently outperforms both existing planning methods and learning-based methods in regular and complex urban driving scenes, demonstrating significant improvements in driving safety and reliability.</p></details> |  |

Compared to urban structured roads, unstructured roads in mining sites have uneven boundaries and lack clearly defined lane markings. This leads to a lack of sufficient constraint information for predicting the trajectories of other human-driven vehicles, resulting in higher uncertainty in trajectory prediction problems. A method is proposed to predict multiple possible trajectories and their probabilities of the target vehicle. The surrounding environment and historical trajectories of the target vehicle are encoded as a rasterized image, which is used as input to our deep convolutional network to predict the target vehicle's multiple possible trajectories. The method underwent offline testing on a dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios in open-pit mining and was compared and evaluated against physics-based method.

Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced MEC networks can leverage the high mobility of UAVs to flexibly adjust network topology, further expanding the applicability of MEC. However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively designs the 3D flight trajectories of UAVs, enabling rapid terminal coverage. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves efficient resource deployment and scheduling, outperforming comparative algorithms by at least 16.7%, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICPR 2024, Kolkata</p></details> |

However, due to the mobility of the vehicles and the limited computational resources for performing task offloading in near-real-time, such schemes may require high latency, thus, become even infeasible. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a Trajectory Prediction-based Pre-offloading Decision (TPPD) algorithm for analyzing the historical trajectories of vehicles to predict their future coordinates, thereby allowing for computational resource allocation in advance. We first utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model to predict each vehicle's movement trajectory. Then, based on the task requirements and the predicted trajectories, we devise a dynamic resource allocation algorithm using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) that enables the edge server to minimize task processing delay, while ensuring effective utilization of the available computational resources. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing that, as compared with traditional real-time task offloading strategies, the proposed TPPD algorithm significantly reduces task processing delay while improving resource utilization.</p></details> |  |

Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

Accurate trajectory planning is the key to reliable vehicle deployments in open-world environment, where unstructured obstacles bring in uncertainties that are impossible to fully capture by training data. For traditional machine learning tasks, such uncertainties are often addressed reasonably well via methods such as continual learning. On the one hand, naively applying those methods to trajectory prediction can result in continuous data collection and frequent model updates, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, the predicted trajectories can be far away from the true trajectories, leading to unsafe decision-making. In this paper, we aim to establish real-time awareness of out-of-distribution in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. We focus on the challenging and practically relevant setting where the out-of-distribution is deceptive, that is, the one not easily detectable by human intuition. Drawing on the well-established techniques of sequential analysis, we build real-time awareness of out-of-distribution by monitoring prediction errors using the quickest change point detection (QCD). Our solutions are lightweight and can handle the occurrence of out-of-distribution at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments.

Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle trajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction remains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties. Additionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is another challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction into a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the appropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two sub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head attention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The GNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to four baseline models. We provide interpretable visualization results to highlight the multi-modality and inherent nature of our neural physics framework. Additionally, ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our key designs.</p></details> |  |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation. EF-Calib provides a convenient and accurate toolbox for calibrating the system that fuses events and frames.

Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance.

To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, it is challenging for aircraft to sustain efficient air-ground communication in urban circumstances. Without continuous air-ground communication, aircraft may experience course deviation and safety accidents. To address these problems, a reconfigurable intelligent surface(RIS)-aided trajectory optimization scheme is proposed enabling efficient air-ground communication and safe aviation in UAM with a layered airspace structure. This paper first devises a dual-plane RIS communication scheme for layered airspace. It fully engages the omnidirectional and directional signal attributes to reduce the transmission delay of the air-ground communication. Based on the dual-plane RIS configuration, we jointly develop the intra- and inter-layer trajectory scheme to optimize communication and safe aviation. In the intra-layer trajectory optimization, we propose a dual-time-scale flight scheme to improve communication capacity and horizontal flight safety. Meanwhile, we propose a safe layer-switching method to ensure collision avoidance during vertical flight in the inter-layer trajectory optimization. The communication load of the proposed scheme can be improved 40% and the time of safe separation restoration can be lessened 66% compared with the benchmarks in the layered airspace.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In complex traffic scenarios, there are two significant issues with the current autonomous driving system: the cognitive uncertainty of prediction and the lack of risk awareness, which limit the further development of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction model that incorporates insights and principles from driving behavior, ethical decision-making, and risk assessment. Based on joint prediction, our model consists of interaction, intention, and risk assessment modules. The dynamic variation of interaction between vehicles can be comprehensively captured at each timestamp in the interaction module. Based on interaction information, our model considers primary intentions for vehicles to enhance the diversity of trajectory generation. The optimization of predicted trajectories follows the advanced risk-aware decision-making principles. Experimental results are evaluated on the DeepAccident dataset; our approach shows its remarkable prediction performance on normal and accident scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by at least 28.9\% and 26.5\%, respectively. The proposed model improves the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction in complex traffic scenarios. The code for the proposed model is available at https://sites.google.com/view/ir-prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Crowd Trip Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15224v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for various applications in active traffic management, urban planning, traffic control, crowd management, and autonomous driving, aiming to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a deep understanding of individual behaviors, social interactions, and road environments. Existing studies have developed various models to capture the influence of social interactions and road conditions on pedestrian trajectories. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of a comprehensive view of social interactions and road environments. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction, we propose a novel approach incorporating trip information as a new modality into pedestrian trajectory models. We propose RNTransformer, a generic model that utilizes crowd trip information to capture global information on social interactions. We incorporated RNTransformer with various socially aware local pedestrian trajectory prediction models to demonstrate its performance. Specifically, by leveraging a pre-trained RNTransformer when training different pedestrian trajectory prediction models, we observed improvements in performance metrics: a 1.3/2.2% enhancement in ADE/FDE on Social-LSTM, a 6.5/28.4% improvement on Social-STGCNN, and an 8.6/4.3% improvement on S-Implicit. Evaluation results demonstrate that RNTransformer significantly enhances the accuracy of various pedestrian trajectory prediction models across multiple datasets. Further investigation reveals that the RNTransformer effectively guides local models to more accurate directions due to the consideration of global information. By exploring crowd behavior within the road network, our approach shows great promise in improving pedestrian safety through accurate trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialCircle+: Learning the Angle-based Conditioned Interaction Representation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14984v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial aspect of understanding human behaviors. Researchers have made efforts to represent socially interactive behaviors among pedestrians and utilize various networks to enhance prediction capability. Unfortunately, they still face challenges not only in fully explaining and measuring how these interactive behaviors work to modify trajectories but also in modeling pedestrians' preferences to plan or participate in social interactions in response to the changeable physical environments as extra conditions. This manuscript mainly focuses on the above explainability and conditionality requirements for trajectory prediction networks. Inspired by marine animals perceiving other companions and the environment underwater by echolocation, this work constructs an angle-based conditioned social interaction representation SocialCircle+ to represent the socially interactive context and its corresponding conditions. It employs a social branch and a conditional branch to describe how pedestrians are positioned in prediction scenes socially and physically in angle-based-cyclic-sequence forms. Then, adaptive fusion is applied to fuse the above conditional clues onto the social ones to learn the final interaction representation. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of SocialCircle+ with different trajectory prediction backbones. Moreover, counterfactual interventions have been made to simultaneously verify the modeling capacity of causalities among interactive variables and the conditioning capability.</p></details> |  |

Chronic wound treatment is currently a manual process, and we envision a future where robotics and automation will aid in this treatment to reduce cost and improve patient care. In this work, we present the development of the first robotic system for wound dressing removal which is reported to be the worst aspect of living with chronic wounds. Our method leverages differentiable physics-based simulation to perform gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimized trajectory planning. By integrating fracture mechanics of adhesion, we are able to model the peeling effect inherent to dressing adhesion. The system is further guided by carefully designed objective functions that promote both efficient and safe control, reducing the risk of tissue damage. We validated the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments conducted on both synthetic skin phantoms and real human subjects. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to achieve precise and safe dressing removal trajectories, offering a promising solution for automating this essential healthcare procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11721v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments, possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory. In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn the optimal distributionally robust policy without modelling the environment, thus the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion. Despite the algorithm's complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Integrated Decision Making and Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Under Multimodal Uncertainties: A Bayesian Game Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13993v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interaction between traffic agents is a key issue in designing safe and non-conservative maneuvers in autonomous driving. This problem can be challenging when multi-modality and behavioral uncertainties are engaged. Existing methods either fail to plan interactively or consider unimodal behaviors that could lead to catastrophic results. In this paper, we introduce an integrated decision-making and trajectory planning framework based on Bayesian game (i.e., game of incomplete information). Human decisions inherently exhibit discrete characteristics and therefore are modeled as types of players in the game. A general solver based on no-regret learning is introduced to obtain a corresponding Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibrium, which captures the interaction between traffic agents in the multimodal context. With the attained equilibrium, decision-making and trajectory planning are performed simultaneously, and the resulting interactive strategy is shown to be optimal over the expectation of rivals' driving intentions. Closed-loop simulations on different traffic scenarios are performed to illustrate the generalizability and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis of combined efficacy and safety outcomes for risk-benefit analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13946v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and effectively communicating the efficacy and toxicity of treatment is the basis of risk benefit analysis (RBA). More efficient and objective tools are needed. We apply Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) to perform RBA with superior objectivity, power, and clarity. We used CWTA to perform 1000-fold simulations of RCTs using ordinal endpoints for both treatment efficacy and toxicity. RCTs were simulated with 1:1 allocation at defined sample sizes and hazard ratios. We studied the simplest case of 3 levels each of toxicity and efficacy and the general case of the advanced cancer trial, with efficacy graded by five RECIST 1.1 health statuses and toxicity by the six-point CTCAE scale (6 x 5 matrix). The latter model was applied to a real-world dose escalation phase I trial in advanced cancer. Simulations in both the 3 x 3 and the 6 x 5 advanced cancer matrix confirmed that drugs with both superior efficacy and toxicity profiles synergize for greater statistical power with CWTA-RBA. The CWTA-RBA 6 x 5 matrix reduced sample size requirements over CWTA efficacy-only analysis. Application to the dose finding phase I clinical trial provided objective, statistically significant validation for the selected dose. CWTA-RBA, by incorporating both drug efficacy and toxicity, provides a single test statistic and plot that analyzes and effectively communicates therapeutic risks and benefits. CWTA-RBA requires fewer patients than CWTA efficacy-only analysis when the experimental drug is both more effective and less toxic. CWTA-RBA facilitates the objective and efficient assessment of new therapies throughout the drug development pathway. Furthermore, several advantages over competing tests in communicating risk-benefit will assist regulatory review, clinical adoption, and understanding of therapeutic risks and benefits by clinicians and patients alike.</p></details> |  |
| **[CUQDS: Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12100v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Concurrent and Scalable Trajectory Optimization for Manufacturing with Redundant Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13448v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a concurrent and scalable trajectory optimization method for redundant robots in this paper to improve the quality of robot-assisted manufacturing. The joint angles, the tool orientations and the manufacturing time-sequences are optimized simultaneously on input trajectories with large numbers of waypoints to improve the kinematic smoothness while incorporating the manufacturing constraints. Differently, existing methods always determine them in a decoupled manner. To deal with the large number of waypoints on a toolpath, we propose a decomposition based numerical scheme to optimize the trajectory in an out-of-core manner which can also run in parallel to improve the efficiency. Simulations and physical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method in examples of robot-assisted additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, the complexity of human mobility patterns is oversimplified by these similarities (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. Moreover, we also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to comprehensively assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-71.5% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Velocity Field: An Informative Traveling Cost Representation for Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13282v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning involves generating a series of space points to be followed in the near future. However, due to the complex and uncertain nature of the driving environment, it is impractical for autonomous vehicles~(AVs) to exhaustively design planning rules for optimizing future trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a local map representation method called Velocity Field. This approach provides heading and velocity priors for trajectory planning tasks, simplifying the planning process in complex urban driving. The heading and velocity priors can be learned from demonstrations of human drivers using our proposed loss. Additionally, we developed an iterative sampling-based planner to train and compare the differences between local map representations. We investigated local map representation forms for planning performance on a real-world dataset. Compared to learned rasterized cost maps, our method demonstrated greater reliability and computational efficiency.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |

However, dynamic MRI faces a major challenge: long acquisition times needed to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to higher costs, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and lower image quality. Compressed Sensing (CS) addresses this problem by acquiring a reduced amount of MR data in the Fourier domain, based on a chosen sampling pattern, and reconstructing the full image from this partial data. While various deep learning methods have been developed to optimize these sampling patterns and improve reconstruction, they often struggle with slow optimization and inference times or are limited to specific temporal dimensions used during training. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-compressed sensing approach that uses 3D window attention and flexible, temporally extendable acquisition trajectories. Our method significantly reduces both training and inference times compared to existing approaches, while also adapting to different temporal dimensions during inference without requiring additional training. Tests with real data show that our approach outperforms current state-of-theart techniques. The code for reproducing all experiments will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistically Robust Trajectory Planning of Multiple Aerial Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12718v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on robust trajectory planning for autonomous agents aims to mitigate uncertainties arising from disturbances and modeling errors while ensuring guaranteed safety. Existing methods primarily utilize stochastic optimal control techniques with chance constraints to maintain a minimum distance among agents with a guaranteed probability. However, these approaches face challenges, such as the use of simplifying assumptions that result in linear system models or Gaussian disturbances, which limit their practicality in complex realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, this work introduces a novel probabilistically robust distributed controller enabling autonomous agents to plan safe trajectories, even under non-Gaussian uncertainty and nonlinear systems. Leveraging exact uncertainty propagation techniques based on mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moment propagation, this method transforms non-Gaussian chance constraints into deterministic ones, seamlessly integrating them into a distributed model predictive control framework solvable with standard optimization tools. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, highlighting its ability to consistently handle various types of uncertainty, ensuring robust and accurate path planning in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV 2024)</p></details> |

Arguably, the maritime domain lags behind, as ships operate on many more degrees of freedom (thus, a much larger search space): there is less physical infrastructure, and rules are less consistent and constraining than what is found on roads. The problem is further complicated by the inevitable co-existence of autonomous and human-operated ships: the latter may take unpredictable decisions, which require adjustments on the autonomous ones. Finally, the problem is inherently decentralised, there is no central authority, and communication means can be very diverse in terms of communication distance and performance, mandating special care on which information is shared and how. In this work, we elaborate on the challenges of trajectory prediction and adaptation for mixed autonomous and human-operated ships, and we propose initial ideas on potential approaches to address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SISSY 2024</p></details> |

As opposed to the standard method of uniformly sampling control inputs (which lead to biased samples of the configuration space), C-Uniform trajectories are generated by control actions which lead to uniform sampling of the configuration space. After presenting an intuitive closed-form solution to generate C-Uniform trajectories for the 1D random-walker, we present a network-flow based optimization method to precompute C-Uniform trajectories for general robot systems. We apply the notion of C-Uniformity to the design of Model Predictive Path Integral controllers. Through simulation experiments, we show that using C-Uniform trajectories significantly improves the performance of MPPI-style controllers, achieving up to 40% coverage performance gain compared to the best baseline. We demonstrate the practical applicability of our method with an implementation on a 1/10th scale racer.</p></details> |  |

This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a novel trajectory-guided approach, the Patch Intensity Convergence (PIC) technique, which generates high-fidelity bounding boxes for UAV detection without manual labeling. This technique forms the foundation of UAVDB, a dedicated database designed specifically for UAV detection. Unlike datasets that often focus on large UAVs or simple backgrounds, UAVDB utilizes high-resolution RGB video to capture UAVs at various scales, from hundreds of pixels to near-single-digit sizes. This extensive scale variation enables robust evaluation of detection algorithms under diverse conditions. Using the PIC technique, bounding boxes can be efficiently generated from trajectory or position data. We benchmark UAVDB using state-of-the-art (SOTA) YOLO series detectors, providing a comprehensive performance analysis.

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

In the existing literatures, All-Wheel-Steering (AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibit inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates non-linearity characteristics, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS (C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by iROS 2024</p></details> |

Understanding environmental dynamics is challenging, not only due to the complexities of modeling pair-wise spatial and temporal interactions but also the diverse influence of group-wise interactions. To decode the comprehensive pair-wise and group-wise interactions in crowded scenarios, we introduce Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network. Hyper-STTN outperformes other state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models on 5 real-world pedestrian motion datasets.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn towards amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and present TOAST: Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and present a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a Lunar rover problem and a 3-degrees-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that TOAST outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/KrishnaswamyLab/ImageFlowNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated narration and moved ablation to main text</p></details> |

This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marginal Structural Modeling of Representative Treatment Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04933v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Marginal structural models (MSMs) are widely used in observational studies to estimate the causal effect of time-varying treatments. Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model. We apply latent growth curve analysis to identify representative treatment trajectories from the observed data and use the posterior probability of latent class membership to summarize the different treatment trajectories. We demonstrate its use in parameterizing the MSMs, which facilitates the interpretations of the results. We apply the method to analyze data from an existing cohort of lung transplant recipients to estimate the effect of Tacrolimus concentrations on the risk of incident chronic kidney disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have discovered that the core idea of our paper overlaps with a previously published work.

| **[Maneuver Decision-Making with Trajectory Streams Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10165v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making, motion planning, and trajectory prediction are crucial in autonomous driving systems. By accurately forecasting the movements of other road users, the decision-making capabilities of the autonomous system can be enhanced, making it more effective in responding to dynamic and unpredictable environments and more adaptive to diverse road scenarios. This paper presents the FFStreams++ approach for decision-making and motion planning of different maneuvers, including unprotected left turn, overtaking, and keep-lane. FFStreams++ is a combination of sampling-based and search-based approaches, where iteratively new sampled trajectories for different maneuvers are generated and optimized, and afterward, a heuristic search planner is called, searching for an optimal plan. We model the autonomous diving system in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and search for the optimal plan using a heuristic Fast-Forward planner. In this approach, the initial state of the problem is modified iteratively through streams, which will generate maneuver-specific trajectory candidates, increasing the iterating level until an optimal plan is found. FFStreams++ integrates a query-connected network model for predicting possible future trajectories for each surrounding obstacle along with their probabilities. The proposed approach was tested on the CommonRoad simulation framework. We use a collection of randomly generated driving scenarios for overtaking and unprotected left turns at intersections to evaluate the FFStreams++ planner. The test results confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively execute various maneuvers to ensure safety and reduce the risk of collisions with nearby traffic agents.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |
| **[From a Single Trajectory to Safety Controller Synthesis of Discrete-Time Nonlinear Polynomial Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10026v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work is concerned with developing a data-driven approach for learning control barrier certificates (CBCs) and associated safety controllers for discrete-time nonlinear polynomial systems with unknown mathematical models, guaranteeing system safety over an infinite time horizon. The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Predictive Planning: Trajectory Planning in Obstruction-Dense Environments for Low-Agility Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16024v2)** | 2024-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Model Predictive Planning (MPP), a trajectory planner for low-agility vehicles such as a fixed-wing aircraft to navigate obstacle-laden environments. MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</p></details> |  |

| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Estimating Generalization Performance Along the Trajectory of Proximal SGD in Robust Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02629v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the generalization performance of iterates obtained by Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and their proximal variants in high-dimensional robust regression problems. The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remember and Recall: Associative-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02201v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a pivotal component of autonomous driving systems, enabling the application of accumulated movement experience to current scenarios. Although most existing methods concentrate on learning continuous representations to gain valuable experience, they often suffer from computational inefficiencies and struggle with unfamiliar situations. To address this issue, we propose the Fragmented-Memory-based Trajectory Prediction (FMTP) model, inspired by the remarkable learning capabilities of humans, particularly their ability to leverage accumulated experience and recall relevant memories in unfamiliar situations. The FMTP model employs discrete representations to enhance computational efficiency by reducing information redundancy while maintaining the flexibility to utilize past experiences. Specifically, we design a learnable memory array by consolidating continuous trajectory representations from the training set using defined quantization operations during the training phase. This approach further eliminates redundant information while preserving essential features in discrete form. Additionally, we develop an advanced reasoning engine based on language models to deeply learn the associative rules among these discrete representations. Our method has been evaluated on various public datasets, including ETH-UCY, inD, SDD, nuScenes, Waymo, and VTL-TP. The extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance and extracts more valuable experience from past trajectories to inform the current state.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajGPT: Irregular Time-Series Representation Learning for Health Trajectory Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02133v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many domains, such as healthcare, time-series data is often irregularly sampled with varying intervals between observations. This poses challenges for classical time-series models that require equally spaced data. To address this, we propose a novel time-series Transformer called Trajectory Generative Pre-trained Transformer (TrajGPT). TrajGPT employs a novel Selective Recurrent Attention (SRA) mechanism, which utilizes a data-dependent decay to adaptively filter out irrelevant past information based on contexts. By interpreting TrajGPT as discretized ordinary differential equations (ODEs), it effectively captures the underlying continuous dynamics and enables time-specific inference for forecasting arbitrary target timesteps. Experimental results demonstrate that TrajGPT excels in trajectory forecasting, drug usage prediction, and phenotype classification without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. By evolving the learned continuous dynamics, TrajGPT can interpolate and extrapolate disease risk trajectories from partially-observed time series. The visualization of predicted health trajectories shows that TrajGPT forecasts unseen diseases based on the history of clinically relevant phenotypes (i.e., contexts).</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Equality Constrained Diffusion for Direct Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01939v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success of diffusion-based generative models in image and natural language processing has ignited interest in diffusion-based trajectory optimization for nonlinear control systems. Existing methods cannot, however, handle the nonlinear equality constraints necessary for direct trajectory optimization. As a result, diffusion-based trajectory optimizers are currently limited to shooting methods, where the nonlinear dynamics are enforced by forward rollouts. This precludes many of the benefits enjoyed by direct methods, including flexible state constraints, reduced numerical sensitivity, and easy initial guess specification. In this paper, we present a method for diffusion-based optimization with equality constraints. This allows us to perform direct trajectory optimization, enforcing dynamic feasibility with constraints rather than rollouts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based optimization algorithm that supports the general nonlinear equality constraints required for direct trajectory optimization.</p></details> |  |

Recently, C-ADMM has been studied in robotics applications such as multi-vehicle target tracking and collaborative manipulation tasks. However, few works have investigated the performance of C-ADMM applied to non-convex problems in robotics applications due to a lack of theoretical guarantees. For this project, we aim to quantitatively explore and examine the convergence behavior of non-convex C-ADMM through the scope of distributed multi-robot trajectory planning. We propose a convex trajectory planning problem by leveraging C-ADMM and Buffered Voronoi Cells (BVCs) to get around the non-convex collision avoidance constraint and compare this convex C-ADMM algorithm to a non-convex C-ADMM baseline with non-convex collision avoidance constraints. We show that the convex C-ADMM algorithm requires 1000 fewer iterations to achieve convergence in a multi-robot waypoint navigation scenario. We also confirm that the non-convex C-ADMM baseline leads to sub-optimal solutions and violation of safety constraints in trajectory generation.</p></details> |  |

To ensure safety, planners must rely on reliable uncertainty information about the predicted future behavior of surrounding agents, yet this aspect has received limited attention. This paper addresses the so-far neglected problem of uncertainty modeling in trajectory prediction. We adopt a holistic approach that focuses on uncertainty quantification, decomposition, and the influence of model composition. Our method is based on a theoretically grounded information-theoretic approach to measure uncertainty, allowing us to decompose total uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components. We conduct extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset to assess how different model architectures and configurations affect uncertainty quantification and model robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to International Conference on Learning Representations (2025)</p></details> |

In this work, we address the problem of one-shot imitation from a single human demonstration, given by an RGB-D video recording. We propose a two-stage process. In the first stage we extract the demonstration trajectory offline. This entails segmenting manipulated objects and determining their relative motion in relation to secondary objects such as containers. In the online trajectory generation stage, we first re-detect all objects, then warp the demonstration trajectory to the current scene and execute it on the robot. To complete these steps, our method leverages several ancillary models, including those for segmentation, relative object pose estimation, and grasp prediction. We systematically evaluate different combinations of correspondence and re-detection methods to validate our design decision across a diverse range of tasks. Specifically, we collect and quantitatively test on demonstrations of ten different tasks including pick-and-place tasks as well as articulated object manipulation. Finally, we perform extensive evaluations on a real robot system to demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our approach in real-world scenarios. We make the code publicly available at http://ditto.cs.uni-freiburg.de.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, accepted at IROS 2024</p></details> |

This approach utilizes the contact-implicit differential dynamic programming (DDP) framework, merging the hard contact model with a linear complementarity constraint. We propose the analytical gradient of the contact impulse based on relaxed complementarity constraints to further the exploration of a variety of contact modes. By leveraging a hard contact model-based simulation and computation of search direction through a smooth gradient, our methodology identifies dynamically feasible state trajectories, control inputs, and contact forces while simultaneously unveiling new contact mode sequences. However, the broadened scope of contact modes does not always ensure real-world applicability. Recognizing this, we implemented differentiable cost terms to guide foot trajectories and make gait patterns. Furthermore, to address the challenge of unstable initial roll-outs in an MPC setting, we employ the multiple shooting variant of DDP. The efficacy of the proposed framework is validated through simulations and real-world demonstrations using a 45 kg HOUND quadruped robot, performing various tasks in simulation and showcasing actual experiments involving a forward trot and a front-leg rearing motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted version for The International Journal of Robotics Research (2024); published version at https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/02783649241273645 / Videos at https://youtu.be/SXD4BJIfyoY</p></details> |

However, such data is also highly sensitive, rendering them susceptible to privacy risks in the event of mismanagement, for example, revealing an individual's identity, home address, or political affiliations. Hence, ensuring that privacy is preserved for this data is a priority. One commonly taken measure to mitigate this concern is aggregation. Previous work by Xu et al. shows that trajectories are still recoverable from anonymised and aggregated datasets. However, the study lacks implementation details, obfuscating the mechanisms of the attack. Additionally, the attack was evaluated on commercial non-public datasets, rendering the results and subsequent claims unverifiable. This study reimplements the trajectory recovery attack from scratch and evaluates it on two open-source datasets, detailing the preprocessing steps and implementation. Results confirm that privacy leakage still exists despite common anonymisation and aggregation methods but also indicate that the initial accuracy claims may have been overly ambitious. We release all code as open-source to ensure the results are entirely reproducible and, therefore, verifiable. Moreover, we propose a stronger attack by designing a series of enhancements to the baseline attack. These enhancements yield higher accuracies by up to 16%, providing an improved benchmark for future research in trajectory recovery methods. Our improvements also enable online execution of the attack, allowing partial attacks on larger datasets previously considered unprocessable, thereby furthering the extent of privacy leakage. The findings emphasise the importance of using strong privacy-preserving mechanisms when releasing aggregated mobility data and not solely relying on aggregation as a means of anonymisation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 17th International Conference on Security of Information and Networks (SIN'24).

These low-thrust missions, typically characterized by long thrust arcs, are highly susceptible to operational disruptions such as unforeseen thruster outages or missed thrust events. Consequently, there is a critical need for efficient trajectory design frameworks which incorporate robustness against such anomalies. In this study, we utilize a robust trajectory design framework to explore the solution space for the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) module to the Earth-Moon L2 Southern 9:2 Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit. We propose algorithmic enhancements to improve the global search for robust solutions, and present a comprehensive analysis of two approaches: a nonconditional approach which involves a purely random search for robust solutions versus a conditional approach which involves warm-starting the search for robust solutions using the non-robust solutions. Our results indicate that by using non-robust solutions as initial guesses for the robust solutions, it is possible to achieve significant improvements in both the rate of convergence and the robustness of the final solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was submitted to Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages with theoretical proof</p></details> |

Recent advances in communication technologies facilitate the emergence of connected vehicles (CVs), which can share traffic information with nearby CVs or infrastructures. At the early stage of connectivity, only a portion of vehicles are CVs. The locations and speeds for those non-CVs (NCs) are not accessible and must be estimated to obtain the full traffic information. To address the above problem, this paper proposes a novel CV-based Vehicle Location and Speed estimation network, CVVLSNet, to simultaneously estimate the vehicle locations and speeds exclusively using partial CV trajectory data. A road cell occupancy (RCO) method is first proposed to represent the variable vehicle state information. Spatiotemporal interactions can be integrated by simply fusing the RCO representations. Then, CVVLSNet, taking the Coding-RAte TransformEr (CRATE) network as a backbone, is introduced to estimate the vehicle locations and speeds. Moreover, physical vehicle size constraints are also considered in loss functions. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly outperformed the existing method under various CV penetration rates, signal timings, and volume-to-capacity ratios.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

With the growing population of blind and visually impaired individuals, the need for intelligent assistive tools that provide real-time warnings about potential collisions with dynamic obstacles is becoming critical. These systems rely on algorithms capable of predicting the trajectories of moving objects, such as pedestrians, to issue timely hazard alerts. However, existing datasets fail to capture the necessary information from the perspective of a blind individual. To address this gap, HEADS-UP offers a novel dataset focused on trajectory prediction in this context. Leveraging this dataset, we propose a semi-local trajectory prediction approach to assess collision risks between blind individuals and pedestrians in dynamic environments. Unlike conventional methods that separately predict the trajectories of both the blind individual (ego agent) and pedestrians, our approach operates within a semi-local coordinate system, a rotated version of the camera's coordinate system, facilitating the prediction process. We validate our method on the HEADS-UP dataset and implement the proposed solution in ROS, performing real-time tests on an NVIDIA Jetson GPU through a user study. Results from both dataset evaluations and live tests demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |

In the Violina framework, we optimize the coefficient matrices of state-space model and memory kernel in the given space using a projected gradient descent method so that its model prediction matches the set of multiple observed data. Using Violina we can identify a linear non-Markovian dynamical system with constraints corresponding to a priori knowledge on the model parameters and memory effects. Using synthetic data, we numerically demonstrate that the Markovian and non-Markovian state-space models identified by the proposed method have considerably better generalization performances compared to the models identified by an existing dynamic decomposition-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 18.9% to 23.4%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |

We formulate an inverse learning problem in a Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower, where each player's action is the trajectory of a dynamical system. We propose an active inverse learning method for the leader to infer which hypothesis among a finite set of candidates best describes the follower's objective function. Instead of using passively observed trajectories like existing methods, we actively maximize the differences in the follower's trajectories under different hypotheses by optimizing the leader's control inputs. Compared with uniformly random inputs, the optimized inputs accelerate the convergence of the estimated probability of different hypotheses conditioned on the follower's trajectory. We demonstrate the proposed method in a receding-horizon repeated trajectory game and simulate the results using virtual TurtleBots in Gazebo.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ACC 2025.

This paper proposes a suboptimal joint trajectory replanning (SJTR) method, which formulates the joint optimization problem of target orbit and flight trajectory after a fault within a convex optimization framework. By incorporating penalty coefficients for terminal constraints, the optimization solution adheres to the orbit redecision principle, thereby avoiding complex decision-making processes and resulting in a concise and rapid solution to the replanning problem. A learning-based warm-start scheme is proposed in conjunction with the designed SJTR method. Offline, a deep neural network (DNN) is trained using a dataset generated by the SJTR method. Online, the DNN provides initial guesses for the time optimization variables based on the current fault situation, enhancing the solving efficiency and reliability of the algorithm. Numerical simulations of the MAV flight scenario under the thrust drop faults are performed, and Monte Carlo experiments and case studies across all orbit types demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional outlier detection relies on heuristic rules, which requires domain knowledge and limits its ability to identify unseen outliers. Besides, there lacks a comprehensive approach that can jointly consider multi-modal data across spatial, temporal, and textual dimensions. Addressing the need for a domain-agnostic model, we propose the Transferable Outlier Detection for Human Semantic Trajectories (TOD4Traj) framework.TOD4Traj first introduces a modality feature unification module to align diverse data feature representations, enabling the integration of multi-modal information and enhancing transferability across different datasets. A contrastive learning module is further pro-posed for identifying regular mobility patterns both temporally and across populations, allowing for a joint detection of outliers based on individual consistency and group majority patterns. Our experimental results have shown TOD4Traj's superior performance over existing models, demonstrating its effectiveness and adaptability in detecting human trajectory outliers across various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an accepted paper on https://sigspatial2024.sigspatial.org/accepted-papers/</p></details> |
| **[Real-time Planning of Minimum-time Trajectories for Agile UAV Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16074v2)** | 2024-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenge of real-time planning of minimum-time trajectories over multiple waypoints, onboard multirotor UAVs. Previous works demonstrated that achieving a truly time-optimal trajectory is computationally too demanding to enable frequent replanning during agile flight, especially on less powerful flight computers. Our approach overcomes this stumbling block by utilizing a point-mass model with a novel iterative thrust decomposition algorithm, enabling the UAV to use all of its collective thrust, something previous point-mass approaches could not achieve. The approach enables gravity and drag modeling integration, significantly reducing tracking errors in high-speed trajectories, which is proven through an ablation study. When combined with a new multi-waypoint optimization algorithm, which uses a gradient-based method to converge to optimal velocities in waypoints, the proposed method generates minimum-time multi-waypoint trajectories within milliseconds. The proposed approach, which we provide as open-source package, is validated both in simulation and in real-world, using Nonlinear Model Predictive Control. With accelerations of up to 3.5g and speeds over 100 km/h, trajectories generated by the proposed method yield similar or even smaller tracking errors than the trajectories generated for a full multirotor model.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have attempted to mitigate this problem by employing traditional LSTM architectures, but these approaches often suffer from inefficiencies in processing large datasets. In response to this challenge, we propose VecLSTM, a novel framework that enhances the performance and efficiency of LSTM-based neural networks. Unlike conventional approaches, VecLSTM incorporates vectorization layers, leveraging optimized mathematical operations to process input sequences more efficiently. We have implemented VecLSTM and incorporated it into the MySQL database. To evaluate the effectiveness of VecLSTM, we compare its performance against a conventional LSTM model using a dataset comprising 1,467,652 samples with seven unique labels. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and efficiency compared to the state-of-the-art, with VecLSTM achieving a validation accuracy of 85.57\%, a test accuracy of 85.47\%, and a weighted F1-score of 0.86. Furthermore, VecLSTM significantly reduces training time, offering a 26.2\% reduction compared to traditional LSTM models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Kinematic Detection of Anomalies in Human Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19136v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Historically, much of the research in understanding, modeling, and mining human trajectory data has focused on where an individual stays. Thus, the focus of existing research has been on where a user goes. On the other hand, the study of how a user moves between locations has great potential for new research opportunities. Kinematic features describe how an individual moves between locations and can be used for tasks such as identification of individuals or anomaly detection. Unfortunately, data availability and quality challenges make kinematic trajectory mining difficult. In this paper, we leverage the Geolife dataset of human trajectories to investigate the viability of using kinematic features to identify individuals and detect anomalies. We show that humans have an individual "kinematic profile" which can be used as a strong signal to identify individual humans. We experimentally show that, for the two use-cases of individual identification and anomaly detection, simple kinematic features fed to standard classification and anomaly detection algorithms significantly improve results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Trajectory Optimization Framework for Differential Drive Robot Class](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07924v2)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential drive robots are widely used in various scenarios thanks to their straightforward principle, from household service robots to disaster response field robots. There are several types of driving mechanisms for real-world applications, including two-wheeled, four-wheeled skid-steering, tracked robots, and so on. The differences in the driving mechanisms usually require specific kinematic modeling when precise control is desired. Furthermore, the nonholonomic dynamics and possible lateral slip lead to different degrees of difficulty in getting feasible and high-quality trajectories. Therefore, a comprehensive trajectory optimization framework to compute trajectories efficiently for various kinds of differential drive robots is highly desirable. In this paper, we propose a universal trajectory optimization framework that can be applied to differential drive robots, enabling the generation of high-quality trajectories within a restricted computational timeframe. We introduce a novel trajectory representation based on polynomial parameterization of motion states or their integrals, such as angular and linear velocities, which inherently matches the robots' motion to the control principle. The trajectory optimization problem is formulated to minimize complexity while prioritizing safety and operational efficiency. We then build a full-stack autonomous planning and control system to demonstrate its feasibility and robustness. We conduct extensive simulations and real-world testing in crowded environments with three kinds of differential drive robots to validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | 15 pages, 15 figures |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline. This approach enhances efficient GPS data preparation and facilitates a deeper understanding of cycling behavior and the cycling environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2nd ACM SIGSPATIAL Workshop on Sustainable Urban Mobility (SUMob 2024)</p></details> |

Methods for trajectory classification are particularly important to detect different movement patterns, while methods for regression to compute motility metrics and forecasting. Recent advances in computer vision have facilitated the processing of trajectories rendered as images via artificial neural networks with 2d convolutional layers (CNNs). This approach leverages the capability of CNNs to learn spatial hierarchies of features from images, necessary to recognize complex shapes. Moreover, it overcomes the limitation of other machine learning methods that require input trajectories with a fixed number of points. However, rendering trajectories as images can introduce poorly investigated artifacts such as information loss due to the plotting of coordinates on a discrete grid, and spectral changes due to line thickness and aliasing. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CNNs for solving classification and regression problems from synthetic trajectories that have been rendered as images using different modalities. The parameters considered in this study include line thickness, image resolution, usage of motion history (color-coding of the temporal component) and anti-aliasing. Results highlight the importance of choosing an appropriate image resolution according to model depth and motion history in applications where movement direction is critical.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

They have complex dynamics, with many parameters that are difficult to identify and that change significantly based on the operating conditions. We propose a simple pseudo-kinematic model, where the intricate dynamic effects underlying the vehicle's motion are captured in a small set of velocity-dependent parameters. This choice enables the development of a Lyapunov-based trajectory controller with guaranteed performance and small computation time. We demonstrate the correctness of our approach with both simulation and experimental data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing trajectory anomaly detection methods are primarily focused on vehicle-level traffic, while human-level trajectory anomaly detection remains under-explored. Since human trajectory data is often very sparse, machine learning methods have become the preferred approach for identifying complex patterns. However, concerns regarding potential biases and the robustness of these models have intensified the demand for more transparent and explainable alternatives. In response to these challenges, our research focuses on developing a lightweight anomaly detection model specifically designed to detect anomalies in human trajectories. We propose a Neural Collaborative Filtering approach to model and predict normal mobility. Our method is designed to model users' daily patterns of life without requiring prior knowledge, thereby enhancing performance in scenarios where data is sparse or incomplete, such as in cold start situations. Our algorithm consists of two main modules. The first is the collaborative filtering module, which applies collaborative filtering to model normal mobility of individual humans to places of interest. The second is the neural module, responsible for interpreting the complex spatio-temporal relationships inherent in human trajectory data. To validate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments using simulated and real-world datasets comparing to numerous state-of-the-art trajectory anomaly detection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the 1st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Workshop on Geospatial Anomaly Detection (GeoAnomalies'24)</p></details> |

This paper introduces BoT-Drive, a planning algorithm that addresses uncertainties at both behavior and trajectory levels within a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework. BoT-Drive employs driver models to characterize unknown behavioral intentions and utilizes their model parameters to infer hidden driving styles. By also treating driver models as decision-making actions for the autonomous vehicle, BoT-Drive effectively tackles the exponential complexity inherent in POMDPs. To enhance safety and robustness, the planner further applies importance sampling to refine the driving trajectory conditioned on the planned high-level behavior. Evaluation on real-world data shows that BoT-Drive consistently outperforms both existing planning methods and learning-based methods in regular and complex urban driving scenes, demonstrating significant improvements in driving safety and reliability.</p></details> |  |

Compared to urban structured roads, unstructured roads in mining sites have uneven boundaries and lack clearly defined lane markings. This leads to a lack of sufficient constraint information for predicting the trajectories of other human-driven vehicles, resulting in higher uncertainty in trajectory prediction problems. A method is proposed to predict multiple possible trajectories and their probabilities of the target vehicle. The surrounding environment and historical trajectories of the target vehicle are encoded as a rasterized image, which is used as input to our deep convolutional network to predict the target vehicle's multiple possible trajectories. The method underwent offline testing on a dataset specifically designed for autonomous driving scenarios in open-pit mining and was compared and evaluated against physics-based method.

Integrating Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with enhanced MEC networks can leverage the high mobility of UAVs to flexibly adjust network topology, further expanding the applicability of MEC. However, in highly dynamic and complex real-world environments, it is crucial to balance task offloading effectiveness with algorithm performance. This paper investigates a multi-UAV communication network equipped with edge computing nodes to assist terminal users in task computation. Our goal is to reduce the task processing delay for users through the joint optimization of discrete computation modes, continuous 3D trajectories, and resource assignment. To address the challenges posed by the mixed action space, we propose a Multi-UAV Edge Computing Resource Scheduling (MUECRS) algorithm, which comprises two key components: 1) trajectory optimization, and 2) computation mode and resource management. Experimental results demonstrate our method effectively designs the 3D flight trajectories of UAVs, enabling rapid terminal coverage. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm achieves efficient resource deployment and scheduling, outperforming comparative algorithms by at least 16.7%, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

We introduce generative modeling of molecular trajectories as a paradigm for learning flexible multi-task surrogate models of MD from data. By conditioning on appropriately chosen frames of the trajectory, we show such generative models can be adapted to diverse tasks such as forward simulation, transition path sampling, and trajectory upsampling. By alternatively conditioning on part of the molecular system and inpainting the rest, we also demonstrate the first steps towards dynamics-conditioned molecular design. We validate the full set of these capabilities on tetrapeptide simulations and show that our model can produce reasonable ensembles of protein monomers. Altogether, our work illustrates how generative modeling can unlock value from MD data towards diverse downstream tasks that are not straightforward to address with existing methods or even MD itself.

Current state-of-the-art motion prediction methods rely on High Definition (HD) maps for capturing the surrounding context of the ego vehicle. Such systems lack scalability in real-world deployment as HD maps are expensive to produce and update in real-time. To overcome this issue, we propose Context Aware Scene Prediction Transformer (CASPFormer), which can perform multi-modal motion prediction from rasterized Bird-Eye-View (BEV) images. Our system can be integrated with any upstream perception module that is capable of generating BEV images. Moreover, CASPFormer directly decodes vectorized trajectories without any postprocessing. Trajectories are decoded recurrently using deformable attention, as it is computationally efficient and provides the network with the ability to focus its attention on the important spatial locations of the BEV images. In addition, we also address the issue of mode collapse for generating multiple scene-consistent trajectories by incorporating learnable mode queries. We evaluate our model on the nuScenes dataset and show that it reaches state-of-the-art across multiple metrics</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review at ICPR 2024, Kolkata</p></details> |

However, due to the mobility of the vehicles and the limited computational resources for performing task offloading in near-real-time, such schemes may require high latency, thus, become even infeasible. To address this issue, in this paper, we present a Trajectory Prediction-based Pre-offloading Decision (TPPD) algorithm for analyzing the historical trajectories of vehicles to predict their future coordinates, thereby allowing for computational resource allocation in advance. We first utilize the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network model to predict each vehicle's movement trajectory. Then, based on the task requirements and the predicted trajectories, we devise a dynamic resource allocation algorithm using a Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) that enables the edge server to minimize task processing delay, while ensuring effective utilization of the available computational resources. Our simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showcasing that, as compared with traditional real-time task offloading strategies, the proposed TPPD algorithm significantly reduces task processing delay while improving resource utilization.</p></details> |  |

Accurately predicting the trajectories of neighboring vehicles is a vital component in understanding the complex driving environment. Yet, training trajectory prediction models is challenging in two ways. Processing the large-scale data is computation-intensive. Moreover, easy-medium driving scenarios often overwhelmingly dominate the dataset, leaving challenging driving scenarios such as dense traffic under-represented. For example, in the Argoverse motion prediction dataset, there are very few instances with $\ge 50$ agents, while scenarios with $10 \thicksim 20$ agents are far more common. In this paper, to mitigate data redundancy in the over-represented driving scenarios and to reduce the bias rooted in the data scarcity of complex ones, we propose a novel data-efficient training method based on coreset selection. This method strategically selects a small but representative subset of data while balancing the proportions of different scenario difficulties. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce a method capable of effectively condensing large-scale trajectory dataset, while achieving a state-of-the-art compression ratio. Notably, even when using only 50% of the Argoverse dataset, the model can be trained with little to no decline in performance. Moreover, the selected coreset maintains excellent generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

Accurate trajectory planning is the key to reliable vehicle deployments in open-world environment, where unstructured obstacles bring in uncertainties that are impossible to fully capture by training data. For traditional machine learning tasks, such uncertainties are often addressed reasonably well via methods such as continual learning. On the one hand, naively applying those methods to trajectory prediction can result in continuous data collection and frequent model updates, which can be resource-intensive. On the other hand, the predicted trajectories can be far away from the true trajectories, leading to unsafe decision-making. In this paper, we aim to establish real-time awareness of out-of-distribution in trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles. We focus on the challenging and practically relevant setting where the out-of-distribution is deceptive, that is, the one not easily detectable by human intuition. Drawing on the well-established techniques of sequential analysis, we build real-time awareness of out-of-distribution by monitoring prediction errors using the quickest change point detection (QCD). Our solutions are lightweight and can handle the occurrence of out-of-distribution at any time during trajectory prediction inference. Experimental results on multiple real-world datasets using a benchmark trajectory prediction model demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, generative AI models have demonstrated promising results in capturing short and long range dependencies in time series data. While these models have also been applied in healthcare, most of them only predict one value at a time, which is unrealistic in a clinical setting where multiple measures are taken at once. In this work, we extend the framework temporal fusion transformer (TFT), a multi-horizon time series prediction tool, and propose TFT-multi, an end-to-end framework that can predict multiple vital trajectories simultaneously. We apply TFT-multi to forecast 5 vital signs recorded in the intensive care unit: blood pressure, pulse, SpO2, temperature and respiratory rate. We hypothesize that by jointly predicting these measures, which are often correlated with one another, we can make more accurate predictions, especially in variables with large missingness. We validate our model on the public MIMIC dataset and an independent institutional dataset, and demonstrate that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art univariate prediction tools including the original TFT and Prophet, as well as vector regression modeling for multivariate prediction. Furthermore, we perform a study case analysis by applying our pipeline to forecast blood pressure changes in response to actual and hypothetical pressor administration.</p></details> |  |

Despite this success, they have seen only limited use in real-world robotics tasks such as trajectory optimization. Two key factors have contributed to this limited success. First, it is challenging to reason about collisions in radiance models. Second, it is difficult to perform inference of radiance models fast enough for real-time trajectory synthesis. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing SPLANNING, a risk-aware trajectory optimizer that operates in a Gaussian Splatting model. This paper first derives a method for rigorously upper-bounding the probability of collision between a robot and a radiance field. Second, this paper introduces a normalized reformulation of Gaussian Splatting that enables the efficient computation of the collision bound in a Gaussian Splat. Third, a method is presented to optimize trajectories while avoiding collisions with a scene represented by a Gaussian Splat. Experiments demonstrate that SPLANNING outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating collision-free trajectories in highly cluttered environments.

Numerous studies have been conducted to predict short-term vehicle trajectories in the immediate future. However, long-term trajectory prediction remains a major challenge due to accumulated errors and uncertainties. Additionally, balancing accuracy with interpretability in the prediction is another challenging issue in predicting vehicle trajectory. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Goal-based Neural Physics Vehicle Trajectory Prediction Model (GNP). The GNP model simplifies vehicle trajectory prediction into a two-stage process: determining the vehicle's goal and then choosing the appropriate trajectory to reach this goal. The GNP model contains two sub-modules to achieve this process. The first sub-module employs a multi-head attention mechanism to accurately predict goals. The second sub-module integrates a deep learning model with a physics-based social force model to progressively predict the complete trajectory using the generated goals. The GNP demonstrates state-of-the-art long-term prediction accuracy compared to four baseline models. We provide interpretable visualization results to highlight the multi-modality and inherent nature of our neural physics framework. Additionally, ablation studies are performed to validate the effectiveness of our key designs.</p></details> |  |

However, calibrating stereo vision systems that incorporate both event and frame-based cameras remains a significant challenge. In this letter, we present EF-Calib, a spatiotemporal calibration framework for event- and frame-based cameras using continuous-time trajectories. A novel calibration pattern applicable to both camera types and the corresponding event recognition algorithm is proposed. Leveraging the asynchronous nature of events, a derivable piece-wise B-spline to represent camera pose continuously is introduced, enabling calibration for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset, with analytical Jacobians provided. Various experiments are carried out to evaluate the calibration performance of EF-Calib, including calibration experiments for intrinsic parameters, extrinsic parameters, and time offset. Experimental results show that EF-Calib achieves the most accurate intrinsic parameters compared to current SOTA, the close accuracy of the extrinsic parameters compared to the frame-based results, and accurate time offset estimation.

| **[Distribution Backtracking Builds A Faster Convergence Trajectory for Diffusion Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15991v2)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the sampling speed of diffusion models remains a significant challenge. Recent score distillation methods distill a heavy teacher model into a student generator to achieve one-step generation, which is optimized by calculating the difference between the two score functions on the samples generated by the student model. However, there is a score mismatch issue in the early stage of the distillation process, because existing methods mainly focus on using the endpoint of pre-trained diffusion models as teacher models, overlooking the importance of the convergence trajectory between the student generator and the teacher model. To address this issue, we extend the score distillation process by introducing the entire convergence trajectory of teacher models and propose Distribution Backtracking Distillation (DisBack). DisBask is composed of two stages: Degradation Recording and Distribution Backtracking. Degradation Recording is designed to obtain the convergence trajectory of the teacher model, which records the degradation path from the trained teacher model to the untrained initial student generator. The degradation path implicitly represents the teacher model's intermediate distributions, and its reverse can be viewed as the convergence trajectory from the student generator to the teacher model. Then Distribution Backtracking trains a student generator to backtrack the intermediate distributions along the path to approximate the convergence trajectory of teacher models. Extensive experiments show that DisBack achieves faster and better convergence than the existing distillation method and accomplishes comparable generation performance, with FID score of 1.38 on ImageNet 64x64 dataset. Notably, DisBack is easy to implement and can be generalized to existing distillation methods to boost performance. Our code is publicly available on https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/SYZhang0805/DisBack</p></details> |
| **[Surrogate Modeling of Trajectory Map-matching in Urban Road Networks using Transformer Sequence-to-Sequence Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12460v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for offline map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 75%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.</p></details> | 15 pages, 10 figures |

However, it is challenging for aircraft to sustain efficient air-ground communication in urban circumstances. Without continuous air-ground communication, aircraft may experience course deviation and safety accidents. To address these problems, a reconfigurable intelligent surface(RIS)-aided trajectory optimization scheme is proposed enabling efficient air-ground communication and safe aviation in UAM with a layered airspace structure. This paper first devises a dual-plane RIS communication scheme for layered airspace. It fully engages the omnidirectional and directional signal attributes to reduce the transmission delay of the air-ground communication. Based on the dual-plane RIS configuration, we jointly develop the intra- and inter-layer trajectory scheme to optimize communication and safe aviation. In the intra-layer trajectory optimization, we propose a dual-time-scale flight scheme to improve communication capacity and horizontal flight safety. Meanwhile, we propose a safe layer-switching method to ensure collision avoidance during vertical flight in the inter-layer trajectory optimization. The communication load of the proposed scheme can be improved 40% and the time of safe separation restoration can be lessened 66% compared with the benchmarks in the layered airspace.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

In complex traffic scenarios, there are two significant issues with the current autonomous driving system: the cognitive uncertainty of prediction and the lack of risk awareness, which limit the further development of autonomous driving. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel trajectory prediction model that incorporates insights and principles from driving behavior, ethical decision-making, and risk assessment. Based on joint prediction, our model consists of interaction, intention, and risk assessment modules. The dynamic variation of interaction between vehicles can be comprehensively captured at each timestamp in the interaction module. Based on interaction information, our model considers primary intentions for vehicles to enhance the diversity of trajectory generation. The optimization of predicted trajectories follows the advanced risk-aware decision-making principles. Experimental results are evaluated on the DeepAccident dataset; our approach shows its remarkable prediction performance on normal and accident scenarios and outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms by at least 28.9\% and 26.5\%, respectively. The proposed model improves the proficiency and adaptability of trajectory prediction in complex traffic scenarios.

| **[Enhancing Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Crowd Trip Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15224v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is essential for various applications in active traffic management, urban planning, traffic control, crowd management, and autonomous driving, aiming to enhance traffic safety and efficiency. Accurately predicting pedestrian trajectories requires a deep understanding of individual behaviors, social interactions, and road environments. Existing studies have developed various models to capture the influence of social interactions and road conditions on pedestrian trajectories. However, these approaches are limited by the lack of a comprehensive view of social interactions and road environments. To address these limitations and enhance the accuracy of pedestrian trajectory prediction, we propose a novel approach incorporating trip information as a new modality into pedestrian trajectory models. We propose RNTransformer, a generic model that utilizes crowd trip information to capture global information on social interactions. We incorporated RNTransformer with various socially aware local pedestrian trajectory prediction models to demonstrate its performance. Specifically, by leveraging a pre-trained RNTransformer when training different pedestrian trajectory prediction models, we observed improvements in performance metrics: a 1.3/2.2% enhancement in ADE/FDE on Social-LSTM, a 6.5/28.4% improvement on Social-STGCNN, and an 8.6/4.3% improvement on S-Implicit. Evaluation results demonstrate that RNTransformer significantly enhances the accuracy of various pedestrian trajectory prediction models across multiple datasets. Further investigation reveals that the RNTransformer effectively guides local models to more accurate directions due to the consideration of global information. By exploring crowd behavior within the road network, our approach shows great promise in improving pedestrian safety through accurate trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SocialCircle+: Learning the Angle-based Conditioned Interaction Representation for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14984v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is a crucial aspect of understanding human behaviors. Researchers have made efforts to represent socially interactive behaviors among pedestrians and utilize various networks to enhance prediction capability. Unfortunately, they still face challenges not only in fully explaining and measuring how these interactive behaviors work to modify trajectories but also in modeling pedestrians' preferences to plan or participate in social interactions in response to the changeable physical environments as extra conditions. This manuscript mainly focuses on the above explainability and conditionality requirements for trajectory prediction networks. Inspired by marine animals perceiving other companions and the environment underwater by echolocation, this work constructs an angle-based conditioned social interaction representation SocialCircle+ to represent the socially interactive context and its corresponding conditions. It employs a social branch and a conditional branch to describe how pedestrians are positioned in prediction scenes socially and physically in angle-based-cyclic-sequence forms. Then, adaptive fusion is applied to fuse the above conditional clues onto the social ones to learn the final interaction representation. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of SocialCircle+ with different trajectory prediction backbones. Moreover, counterfactual interventions have been made to simultaneously verify the modeling capacity of causalities among interactive variables and the conditioning capability.</p></details> |  |

Chronic wound treatment is currently a manual process, and we envision a future where robotics and automation will aid in this treatment to reduce cost and improve patient care. In this work, we present the development of the first robotic system for wound dressing removal which is reported to be the worst aspect of living with chronic wounds. Our method leverages differentiable physics-based simulation to perform gradient-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) for optimized trajectory planning. By integrating fracture mechanics of adhesion, we are able to model the peeling effect inherent to dressing adhesion. The system is further guided by carefully designed objective functions that promote both efficient and safe control, reducing the risk of tissue damage. We validated the efficacy of our approach through a series of experiments conducted on both synthetic skin phantoms and real human subjects. Our results demonstrate the system's ability to achieve precise and safe dressing removal trajectories, offering a promising solution for automating this essential healthcare procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

However, in the human task-solving trajectories, we observe significant misalignments between human intentions and the recorded trajectories, which can undermine AI model training. This paper addresses the challenges of these misalignments by proposing a visualization tool and a heuristic algorithm designed to detect and categorize discrepancies in trajectory data. Although the heuristic algorithm requires a set of predefined human intentions to function, which we currently cannot extract, the visualization tool offers valuable insights into the nature of these misalignments. We expect that eliminating these misalignments could significantly improve the utility of trajectory data for AI model training. We also propose that future work should focus on developing methods, such as Topic Modeling, to accurately extract human intentions from trajectory data, thereby enhancing the alignment between user actions and AI learning processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Trajectory Distributionally Robust Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11721v2)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To mitigate the limitation that the classical reinforcement learning (RL) framework heavily relies on identical training and test environments, Distributionally Robust RL (DRRL) has been proposed to enhance performance across a range of environments, possibly including unknown test environments. As a price for robustness gain, DRRL involves optimizing over a set of distributions, which is inherently more challenging than optimizing over a fixed distribution in the non-robust case. Existing DRRL algorithms are either model-based or fail to learn from a single sample trajectory. In this paper, we design a first fully model-free DRRL algorithm, called distributionally robust Q-learning with single trajectory (DRQ). We delicately design a multi-timescale framework to fully utilize each incrementally arriving sample and directly learn the optimal distributionally robust policy without modelling the environment, thus the algorithm can be trained along a single trajectory in a model-free fashion. Despite the algorithm's complexity, we provide asymptotic convergence guarantees by generalizing classical stochastic approximation tools. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the superior robustness and sample complexity of our proposed algorithm, compared to non-robust methods and other robust RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contribute equally</p></details> |
| **[Integrated Decision Making and Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Under Multimodal Uncertainties: A Bayesian Game Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13993v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling the interaction between traffic agents is a key issue in designing safe and non-conservative maneuvers in autonomous driving. This problem can be challenging when multi-modality and behavioral uncertainties are engaged. Existing methods either fail to plan interactively or consider unimodal behaviors that could lead to catastrophic results. In this paper, we introduce an integrated decision-making and trajectory planning framework based on Bayesian game (i.e., game of incomplete information). Human decisions inherently exhibit discrete characteristics and therefore are modeled as types of players in the game. A general solver based on no-regret learning is introduced to obtain a corresponding Bayesian Coarse Correlated Equilibrium, which captures the interaction between traffic agents in the multimodal context. With the attained equilibrium, decision-making and trajectory planning are performed simultaneously, and the resulting interactive strategy is shown to be optimal over the expectation of rivals' driving intentions. Closed-loop simulations on different traffic scenarios are performed to illustrate the generalizability and the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis of combined efficacy and safety outcomes for risk-benefit analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13946v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing and effectively communicating the efficacy and toxicity of treatment is the basis of risk benefit analysis (RBA). More efficient and objective tools are needed. We apply Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) to perform RBA with superior objectivity, power, and clarity. We used CWTA to perform 1000-fold simulations of RCTs using ordinal endpoints for both treatment efficacy and toxicity. RCTs were simulated with 1:1 allocation at defined sample sizes and hazard ratios. We studied the simplest case of 3 levels each of toxicity and efficacy and the general case of the advanced cancer trial, with efficacy graded by five RECIST 1.1 health statuses and toxicity by the six-point CTCAE scale (6 x 5 matrix). The latter model was applied to a real-world dose escalation phase I trial in advanced cancer. Simulations in both the 3 x 3 and the 6 x 5 advanced cancer matrix confirmed that drugs with both superior efficacy and toxicity profiles synergize for greater statistical power with CWTA-RBA. The CWTA-RBA 6 x 5 matrix reduced sample size requirements over CWTA efficacy-only analysis. Application to the dose finding phase I clinical trial provided objective, statistically significant validation for the selected dose. CWTA-RBA, by incorporating both drug efficacy and toxicity, provides a single test statistic and plot that analyzes and effectively communicates therapeutic risks and benefits. CWTA-RBA requires fewer patients than CWTA efficacy-only analysis when the experimental drug is both more effective and less toxic. CWTA-RBA facilitates the objective and efficient assessment of new therapies throughout the drug development pathway. Furthermore, several advantages over competing tests in communicating risk-benefit will assist regulatory review, clinical adoption, and understanding of therapeutic risks and benefits by clinicians and patients alike.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

The joint angles, the tool orientations and the manufacturing time-sequences are optimized simultaneously on input trajectories with large numbers of waypoints to improve the kinematic smoothness while incorporating the manufacturing constraints. Differently, existing methods always determine them in a decoupled manner. To deal with the large number of waypoints on a toolpath, we propose a decomposition based numerical scheme to optimize the trajectory in an out-of-core manner which can also run in parallel to improve the efficiency. Simulations and physical experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the performance of our method in examples of robot-assisted additive manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Synthetic Human Trajectories: Imitative Generation and Benchmarks Beyond Datasaurus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13790v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human trajectory data, which plays a crucial role in various applications such as crowd management and epidemic prevention, is challenging to obtain due to practical constraints and privacy concerns. In this context, synthetic human trajectory data is generated to simulate as close as possible to real-world human trajectories, often under summary statistics and distributional similarities. However, the complexity of human mobility patterns is oversimplified by these similarities (a.k.a. ``Datasaurus''), resulting in intrinsic biases in both generative model design and benchmarks of the generated trajectories. Against this background, we propose MIRAGE, a huMan-Imitative tRAjectory GenErative model designed as a neural Temporal Point Process integrating an Exploration and Preferential Return model. It imitates the human decision-making process in trajectory generation, rather than fitting any specific statistical distributions as traditional methods do, thus avoiding the Datasaurus issue. Moreover, we also propose a comprehensive task-based evaluation protocol beyond Datasaurus to systematically benchmark trajectory generative models on four typical downstream tasks, integrating multiple techniques and evaluation metrics for each task, to comprehensively assess the ultimate utility of the generated trajectories. We conduct a thorough evaluation of MIRAGE on three real-world user trajectory datasets against a sizeable collection of baselines. Results show that compared to the best baselines, MIRAGE-generated trajectory data not only achieves the best statistical and distributional similarities with 59.0-71.5% improvement, but also yields the best performance in the task-based evaluation with 10.9-33.4% improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[TISIS : Trajectory Indexing for SImilarity Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11301v2)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media platforms enable users to share diverse types of information, including geolocation data that captures their movement patterns. Such geolocation data can be leveraged to reconstruct the trajectory of a user's visited Points of Interest (POIs). A key requirement in numerous applications is the ability to measure the similarity between such trajectories, as this facilitates the retrieval of trajectories that are similar to a given reference trajectory. This is the main focus of our work. Existing methods predominantly rely on applying a similarity function to each candidate trajectory to identify those that are sufficiently similar. However, this approach becomes computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale datasets. To mitigate this challenge, we propose TISIS, an efficient method that uses trajectory indexing to quickly find similar trajectories that share common POIs in the same order. Furthermore, to account for scenarios where POIs in trajectories may not exactly match but are contextually similar, we introduce TISIS*, a variant of TISIS that incorporates POI embeddings. This extension allows for more comprehensive retrieval of similar trajectories by considering semantic similarities between POIs, beyond mere exact matches. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms a baseline method based on the well-known Longest Common SubSequence (LCSS) algorithm, yielding substantial performance improvements across various real-world datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the complex and uncertain nature of the driving environment, it is impractical for autonomous vehicles~(AVs) to exhaustively design planning rules for optimizing future trajectories. To address this issue, we propose a local map representation method called Velocity Field. This approach provides heading and velocity priors for trajectory planning tasks, simplifying the planning process in complex urban driving. The heading and velocity priors can be learned from demonstrations of human drivers using our proposed loss. Additionally, we developed an iterative sampling-based planner to train and compare the differences between local map representations. We investigated local map representation forms for planning performance on a real-world dataset. Compared to learned rasterized cost maps, our method demonstrated greater reliability and computational efficiency.</p></details> | ROBIO 2023 |

However, dynamic MRI faces a major challenge: long acquisition times needed to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution. This leads to higher costs, patient discomfort, motion artifacts, and lower image quality. Compressed Sensing (CS) addresses this problem by acquiring a reduced amount of MR data in the Fourier domain, based on a chosen sampling pattern, and reconstructing the full image from this partial data. While various deep learning methods have been developed to optimize these sampling patterns and improve reconstruction, they often struggle with slow optimization and inference times or are limited to specific temporal dimensions used during training. In this work, we introduce a novel deep-compressed sensing approach that uses 3D window attention and flexible, temporally extendable acquisition trajectories. Our method significantly reduces both training and inference times compared to existing approaches, while also adapting to different temporal dimensions during inference without requiring additional training. Tests with real data show that our approach outperforms current state-of-theart techniques. The code for reproducing all experiments will be made available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily utilize stochastic optimal control techniques with chance constraints to maintain a minimum distance among agents with a guaranteed probability. However, these approaches face challenges, such as the use of simplifying assumptions that result in linear system models or Gaussian disturbances, which limit their practicality in complex realistic scenarios. To address these limitations, this work introduces a novel probabilistically robust distributed controller enabling autonomous agents to plan safe trajectories, even under non-Gaussian uncertainty and nonlinear systems. Leveraging exact uncertainty propagation techniques based on mixed-trigonometric-polynomial moment propagation, this method transforms non-Gaussian chance constraints into deterministic ones, seamlessly integrating them into a distributed model predictive control framework solvable with standard optimization tools. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique, highlighting its ability to consistently handle various types of uncertainty, ensuring robust and accurate path planning in complex scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>18th ...</summary><p>18th International Conference on Control, Automation, Robotics and Vision (ICARCV 2024)</p></details> |

Arguably, the maritime domain lags behind, as ships operate on many more degrees of freedom (thus, a much larger search space): there is less physical infrastructure, and rules are less consistent and constraining than what is found on roads. The problem is further complicated by the inevitable co-existence of autonomous and human-operated ships: the latter may take unpredictable decisions, which require adjustments on the autonomous ones. Finally, the problem is inherently decentralised, there is no central authority, and communication means can be very diverse in terms of communication distance and performance, mandating special care on which information is shared and how. In this work, we elaborate on the challenges of trajectory prediction and adaptation for mixed autonomous and human-operated ships, and we propose initial ideas on potential approaches to address them.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SISSY 2024</p></details> |

As opposed to the standard method of uniformly sampling control inputs (which lead to biased samples of the configuration space), C-Uniform trajectories are generated by control actions which lead to uniform sampling of the configuration space. After presenting an intuitive closed-form solution to generate C-Uniform trajectories for the 1D random-walker, we present a network-flow based optimization method to precompute C-Uniform trajectories for general robot systems. We apply the notion of C-Uniformity to the design of Model Predictive Path Integral controllers. Through simulation experiments, we show that using C-Uniform trajectories significantly improves the performance of MPPI-style controllers, achieving up to 40% coverage performance gain compared to the best baseline.

This method leverages the similarities between language statements and trajectories, both of which consist of ordered elements requiring coherence through external rules and contextual variations. By treating trajectories as sequences of tokens, our model learns the probability distributions over trajectories, enabling the identification of anomalous locations with high precision. We incorporate user-specific tokens to account for individual behavior patterns, enhancing anomaly detection tailored to user context. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LM-TAD on both synthetic and real-world datasets. In particular, the model outperforms existing methods on the Pattern of Life (PoL) dataset by detecting user-contextual anomalies and achieves competitive results on the Porto taxi dataset, highlighting its adaptability and robustness. Additionally, we introduce the use of perplexity and surprisal rate metrics for detecting outliers and pinpointing specific anomalous locations within trajectories. The LM-TAD framework supports various trajectory representations, including GPS coordinates, staypoints, and activity types, proving its versatility in handling diverse trajectory data. Moreover, our approach is well-suited for online trajectory anomaly detection, significantly reducing computational latency by caching key-value states of the attention mechanism, thereby avoiding repeated computations.</p></details> |  |

However, this task is generally nontrivial due to the inherent stochasticity of human motion, which naturally requires the predictor to generate multi-modal prediction. Previous works leverage various generative methods, such as GAN and VAE, for pedestrian trajectory prediction. Nevertheless, these methods may suffer from mode collapse and relatively low-quality results. The denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) has recently been applied to trajectory prediction due to its simple training process and powerful reconstruction ability. However, current diffusion-based methods do not fully utilize input information and usually require many denoising iterations that lead to a long inference time or an additional network for initialization. To address these challenges and facilitate the use of diffusion models in multi-modal trajectory prediction, we propose GDTS, a novel Goal-Guided Diffusion Model with Tree Sampling for multi-modal trajectory prediction. Considering the "goal-driven" characteristics of human motion, GDTS leverages goal estimation to guide the generation of the diffusion network. A two-stage tree sampling algorithm is presented, which leverages common features to reduce the inference time and improve accuracy for multi-modal prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance with real-time inference speed in public datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |

In the existing literatures, All-Wheel-Steering (AWS) robots, incorporating modes such as rotation-free translation maneuvers, in-situ rotational maneuvers, and proportional steering, exhibit inefficient performance due to time-consuming mode switches. This inefficiency arises from wheel rotation constraints and inter-wheel cooperation requirements. The direct application of a holonomic moving strategy can lead to significant slip angles or even structural failure. Additionally, the limited steering range of AWS wheeled robots exacerbates non-linearity characteristics, thereby complicating control processes. To address these challenges, we developed a novel planning method termed Constrained AWS (C-AWS), which integrates second-order discrete search with predictive control techniques. Experimental results demonstrate that our method adeptly generates feasible and smooth trajectories for C-AWS while adhering to steering angle constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by iROS 2024</p></details> |

Understanding environmental dynamics is challenging, not only due to the complexities of modeling pair-wise spatial and temporal interactions but also the diverse influence of group-wise interactions. To decode the comprehensive pair-wise and group-wise interactions in crowded scenarios, we introduce Hyper-STTN, a Hypergraph-based Spatial-Temporal Transformer Network for crowd trajectory prediction. In Hyper-STTN, crowded group-wise correlations are constructed using a set of multi-scale hypergraphs with varying group sizes, captured through random-walk robability-based hypergraph spectral convolution. Additionally, a spatial-temporal transformer is adapted to capture pedestrians' pair-wise latent interactions in spatial-temporal dimensions. These heterogeneous group-wise and pair-wise are then fused and aligned though a multimodal transformer network. Hyper-STTN outperformes other state-of-the-art baselines and ablation models on 5 real-world pedestrian motion datasets.</p></details> |  |

In particular, reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in the synthesis of controllers for systems with complex dynamics and modest online compute budgets. However, the poor sample efficiency of RL and the challenges of reward design make training slow and sometimes unstable, especially for high-dimensional systems. In this work, we leverage the inherent Lie group symmetries of robotic systems with a floating base to mitigate these challenges when learning tracking controllers. We model a general tracking problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) that captures the evolution of both the physical and reference states. Next, we prove that symmetry in the underlying dynamics and running costs leads to an MDP homomorphism, a mapping that allows a policy trained on a lower-dimensional "quotient" MDP to be lifted to an optimal tracking controller for the original system. We compare this symmetry-informed approach to an unstructured baseline, using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to learn tracking controllers for three systems: the Particle (a forced point mass), the Astrobee (a fullyactuated space robot), and the Quadrotor (an underactuated system). Results show that a symmetry-aware approach both accelerates training and reduces tracking error after the same number of training steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first three authors contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Pseudo-labeling approaches to semi-supervised learning adopt a teacher-student framework in which machine-generated pseudo-labels on a large unlabeled dataset are used in combination with a small manually-labeled dataset for training. In this work, we address the problem of improving pseudo-label quality through leveraging long-term temporal information captured in driving scenes. More specifically, we leverage pre-trained motion-forecasting models to generate object trajectories on pseudo-labeled data to further enhance the student model training. Our approach improves pseudo-label quality in two distinct manners: first, we suppress false positive pseudo-labels through establishing consistency across multiple frames of motion forecasting outputs. Second, we compensate for false negative detections by directly inserting predicted object tracks into the pseudo-labeled scene. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, improving the performance of standard semi-supervised approaches in a variety of settings.</p></details> |  |

However, the nonlinear optimization solvers required remain too slow for use on relatively resource-constrained flight-grade computers. In this work, we turn towards amortized optimization, a learning-based technique for accelerating optimization run times, and present TOAST: Trajectory Optimization with Merit Function Warm Starts. Offline, using data collected from a simulation, we train a neural network to learn a mapping to the full primal and dual solutions given the problem parameters. Crucially, we build upon recent results from decision-focused learning and present a set of decision-focused loss functions using the notion of merit functions for optimization problems. We show that training networks with such constraint-informed losses can better encode the structure of the trajectory optimization problem and jointly learn to reconstruct the primal-dual solution while yielding improved constraint satisfaction. Through numerical experiments on a Lunar rover problem and a 3-degrees-of-freedom Mars powered descent guidance problem, we demonstrate that TOAST outperforms benchmark approaches in terms of both computation times and network prediction constraint satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

However, predictive modeling of such data remains challenging due to high dimensionality, irregular sampling, and data sparsity. To address these issues, we propose ImageFlowNet, a novel model designed to forecast disease trajectories from initial images while preserving spatial details. ImageFlowNet first learns multiscale joint representation spaces across patients and time points, then optimizes deterministic or stochastic flow fields within these spaces using a position-parameterized neural ODE/SDE framework. The model leverages a UNet architecture to create robust multiscale representations and mitigates data scarcity by combining knowledge from all patients. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We validate ImageFlowNet on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma, demonstrating its ability to effectively forecast disease progression and outperform existing methods. Our contributions include the development of ImageFlowNet, its theoretical underpinnings, and empirical validation on real-world datasets.

This formulation provides a new framework for analyzing and designing feedback control laws. We show that any stable closed-loop system can be expressed in this form with appropriate values for the step size and value matrices. Furthermore, we show that this parameterization of the closed-loop system is equivalent to a linear quadratic regulator for appropriately chosen weighting matrices. We also show that trajectories can be shaped using this approach to achieve a desired closed-loop behavior.</p></details> |  |

Despite its popularity, limited attention has been paid to summarizing the treatment history in the outcome model, which proves particularly challenging when individuals' treatment trajectories exhibit complex patterns over time. Commonly used metrics such as the average treatment level fail to adequately capture the treatment history, hindering causal interpretation. For scenarios where treatment histories exhibit distinct temporal patterns, we develop a new approach to parameterize the outcome model. We apply latent growth curve analysis to identify representative treatment trajectories from the observed data and use the posterior probability of latent class membership to summarize the different treatment trajectories. We demonstrate its use in parameterizing the MSMs, which facilitates the interpretations of the results. We apply the method to analyze data from an existing cohort of lung transplant recipients to estimate the effect of Tacrolimus concentrations on the risk of incident chronic kidney disease.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have discovered that the core idea of our paper overlaps with a previously published work.

| **[Maneuver Decision-Making with Trajectory Streams Prediction for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10165v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision-making, motion planning, and trajectory prediction are crucial in autonomous driving systems. By accurately forecasting the movements of other road users, the decision-making capabilities of the autonomous system can be enhanced, making it more effective in responding to dynamic and unpredictable environments and more adaptive to diverse road scenarios. This paper presents the FFStreams++ approach for decision-making and motion planning of different maneuvers, including unprotected left turn, overtaking, and keep-lane. FFStreams++ is a combination of sampling-based and search-based approaches, where iteratively new sampled trajectories for different maneuvers are generated and optimized, and afterward, a heuristic search planner is called, searching for an optimal plan. We model the autonomous diving system in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and search for the optimal plan using a heuristic Fast-Forward planner. In this approach, the initial state of the problem is modified iteratively through streams, which will generate maneuver-specific trajectory candidates, increasing the iterating level until an optimal plan is found. FFStreams++ integrates a query-connected network model for predicting possible future trajectories for each surrounding obstacle along with their probabilities. The proposed approach was tested on the CommonRoad simulation framework. We use a collection of randomly generated driving scenarios for overtaking and unprotected left turns at intersections to evaluate the FFStreams++ planner. The test results confirmed that the proposed approach can effectively execute various maneuvers to ensure safety and reduce the risk of collisions with nearby traffic agents.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

The proposed approach leverages measured data acquired through an input-output observation, referred to as a single trajectory, collected over a specified time horizon. By fulfilling a certain rank condition, which ensures the unknown system is persistently excited by the collected data, we design a CBC and its corresponding safety controller directly from the finite-length observed data, without explicitly identifying the unknown dynamical system. This is achieved through proposing a data-based sum-of-squares optimization (SOS) program to systematically design CBCs and their safety controllers. We validate our data-driven approach over two physical case studies including a jet engine and a Lorenz system, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

MPP consists of (1) a multi-path planning procedure that identifies candidate paths, (2) a raytracing procedure that generates linear constraints around these paths to enforce obstacle avoidance, and (3) a convex quadratic program that finds a feasible trajectory within these constraints if one exists. Low-agility aircraft cannot track arbitrary paths, so refining a given path into a trajectory that respects the vehicle's limited maneuverability and avoids obstacles often leads to an infeasible optimization problem. The critical feature of MPP is that it efficiently considers multiple candidate paths during the refinement process, thereby greatly increasing the chance of finding a feasible and trackable trajectory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MPP on a longitudinal aircraft model.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we propose a Grounding Large language model with Imperfect world MOdel (GLIMO), which utilizes proxy world models such as simulators to collect and synthesize trining data. GLIMO incorporates an LLM agent-based data generator to automatically create high-quality and diverse instruction datasets. The generator includes an iterative self-refining module for temporally consistent experience sampling, a diverse set of question-answering instruction seeds, and a retrieval-augmented generation module for reflecting on prior experiences. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach improve the performance of strong open-source LLMs like LLaMA-3 with a performance boost of 2.04 $\times$, 1.54 $\times$, and 1.82 $\times$ across three different benchmarks, respectively. The performance is able to compete with or surpass their larger counterparts such as GPT-4.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models as Markov Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02724v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have proven to be remarkably efficient, both across a wide range of natural language processing tasks and well beyond them. However, a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the origins of their impressive performance remains elusive. In this paper, we approach this challenging task by drawing an equivalence between generic autoregressive language models with vocabulary of size $T$ and context window of size $K$ and Markov chains defined on a finite state space of size $\mathcal{O}(T^K)$. We derive several surprising findings related to the existence of a stationary distribution of Markov chains that capture the inference power of LLMs, their speed of convergence to it, and the influence of the temperature on the latter. We then prove pre-training and in-context generalization bounds and show how the drawn equivalence allows us to enrich their interpretation. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical guarantees with experiments on several recent LLMs to highlight how they capture the behavior observed in practice.</p></details> | 49 pages, 17 figures |

This paper describes a simple approach for detecting such contextual hallucinations. We hypothesize that contextual hallucinations are related to the extent to which an LLM attends to information in the provided context versus its own generations. Based on this intuition, we propose a simple hallucination detection model whose input features are given by the ratio of attention weights on the context versus newly generated tokens (for each attention head). We find that a linear classifier based on these lookback ratio features is as effective as a richer detector that utilizes the entire hidden states of an LLM or a text-based entailment model. The lookback ratio-based detector -- Lookback Lens -- is found to transfer across tasks and even models, allowing a detector that is trained on a 7B model to be applied (without retraining) to a larger 13B model. We further apply this detector to mitigate contextual hallucinations, and find that a simple classifier-guided decoding approach is able to reduce the amount of hallucination, for example by 9.6% in the XSum summarization task.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 main conference long paper.

The study introduces a novel and efficient format for the representation of code modification, using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Code Llama and Mistral. These models, fine-tuned on datasets featuring C code vulnerabilities, significantly improve the accuracy and adaptability of automated code repair techniques. A key finding is the enhanced repair accuracy of these models when compared to previous methods such as VulRepair, which underscores their practical utility and efficiency. The research also offers a critical assessment of current evaluation metrics, such as perfect predictions, and their limitations in reflecting the true capabilities of automated repair models in real-world scenarios. Following this, it underscores the importance of using test datasets devoid of train samples, emphasizing the need for dataset integrity to enhance the effectiveness of LLMs in code repair tasks. The significance of this work is its contribution to digital security, setting new standards for automated code vulnerability repair and paving the way for future advancements in the fields of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. The study does not only highlight the potential of LLMs in enhancing code security but also fosters further exploration and research in these crucial areas.</p></details> |  |

Among these challenges, the issue of memorization stands out, posing significant ethical and legal risks. In this paper, we presents a Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) on the topic of memorization in LLMs. Memorization is the effect that a model tends to store and reproduce phrases or passages from the training data and has been shown to be the fundamental issue to various privacy and security attacks against LLMs. We begin by providing an overview of the literature on the memorization, exploring it across five key dimensions: intentionality, degree, retrievability, abstraction, and transparency. Next, we discuss the metrics and methods used to measure memorization, followed by an analysis of the factors that contribute to memorization phenomenon. We then examine how memorization manifests itself in specific model architectures and explore strategies for mitigating these effects. We conclude our overview by identifying potential research topics for the near future: to develop methods for balancing performance and privacy in LLMs, and the analysis of memorization in specific contexts, including conversational agents, retrieval-augmented generation, multilingual language models, and diffusion language models.</p></details> |  |

With strong language processing capabilities and remarkable versatility, large language models (LLMs) have become popular choices for zero-shot re-ranking in IR systems. So far, LLM-based re-ranking methods rely on strong generative capabilities, which restricts their use to either specialized or powerful proprietary models. Given these restrictions, we ask: is autoregressive generation necessary and optimal for LLMs to perform re-ranking? We hypothesize that there are abundant signals relevant to re-ranking within LLMs that might not be used to their full potential via generation. To more directly leverage such signals, we propose in-context re-ranking (ICR), a novel method that leverages the change in attention pattern caused by the search query for accurate and efficient re-ranking. To mitigate the intrinsic biases in LLMs, we propose a calibration method using a content-free query. Due to the absence of generation, ICR only requires two ($O(1)$) forward passes to re-rank $N$ documents, making it substantially more efficient than generative re-ranking methods that require at least $O(N)$ forward passes. Our novel design also enables ICR to be applied to any LLM without specialized training while guaranteeing a well-formed ranking. Extensive experiments with two popular open-weight LLMs on standard single-hop and multi-hop information retrieval benchmarks show that ICR outperforms RankGPT while cutting the latency by more than 60% in practice. Through detailed analyses, we show that ICR's performance is specially strong on tasks that require more complex re-ranking signals. Our findings call for further exploration on novel ways of utilizing open-weight LLMs beyond text generation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing studies on labor migration largely rely on limited survey data with statistical methods, which fail to deliver timely and fine-grained insights for time-varying regional trends. To this end, we propose a deep learning-based spatial-temporal labor migration analysis framework, DHG-SIL, by leveraging large-scale job query data. Specifically, we first acquire labor migration intention as a proxy of labor migration via job queries from one of the world's largest search engines. Then, a Disprepant Homophily co-preserved Graph Convolutional Network (DH-GCN) and an interpretable temporal module are respectively proposed to capture cross-city and sequential labor migration dependencies. Besides, we introduce four interpretable variables to quantify city migration properties, which are co-optimized with city representations via tailor-designed contrastive losses. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our DHG-SIL. Notably, DHG-SIL has been deployed as a core component of a cooperative partner's intelligent human resource system, and the system supported a series of city talent attraction reports.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model for Multi-Domain Translation: Benchmarking and Domain CoT Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02631v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving consistent high-quality machine translation (MT) across diverse domains remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the limited and imbalanced parallel training data available in various domains. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive general understanding and generation abilities, their potential in multi-domain MT is under-explored. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for multi-domain translation, featuring 25 German$\Leftrightarrow$English and 22 Chinese$\Leftrightarrow$English test sets respectively covering 15 domains. Our evaluation of prominent LLMs reveals a discernible performance gap against traditional MT systems, highlighting domain overfitting and catastrophic forgetting issues after fine-tuning on domain-limited corpora. To mitigate this, we propose a domain Chain of Thought (CoT) fine-tuning technique that utilizes the intrinsic multi-domain intelligence of LLMs to improve translation performance. This method inspires the LLM to perceive domain information from the source text, which then serves as a helpful hint to guide the translation process. Despite being trained on a small dataset of four domains, our CoT fine-tune approach achieves notable enhancements in translation accuracy and domain robustness than traditional fine-tuning, as evidenced by an average 1.53 BLEU score increase in over 20 German$\rightarrow$English distinct out-of-domain tests.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we focus on their multi-hop reasoning capability: the ability to identify and integrate information from multiple textual sources. Given the concerns with the presence of simplifying cues in existing multi-hop reasoning benchmarks, which allow models to circumvent the reasoning requirement, we set out to investigate, whether LLMs are prone to exploiting such simplifying cues. We find evidence that they indeed circumvent the requirement to perform multi-hop reasoning, but they do so in more subtle ways than what was reported about their fine-tuned pre-trained language model (PLM) predecessors. Motivated by this finding, we propose a challenging multi-hop reasoning benchmark, by generating seemingly plausible multi-hop reasoning chains, which ultimately lead to incorrect answers. We evaluate multiple open and proprietary state-of-the-art LLMs, and find that their performance to perform multi-hop reasoning is affected, as indicated by up to 45% relative decrease in F1 score when presented with such seemingly plausible alternatives. We conduct a deeper analysis and find evidence that while LLMs tend to ignore misleading lexical cues, misleading reasoning paths indeed present a significant challenge.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Quantifying Generalization Complexity for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01769v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in understanding complex queries and performing sophisticated tasks, their generalization abilities are often deeply entangled with memorization, necessitating more precise evaluation. To address this challenge, we introduce Scylla, a dynamic evaluation framework that quantitatively measures the generalization abilities of LLMs. Scylla disentangles generalization from memorization via assessing model performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data through 20 tasks across 5 levels of complexity. Through extensive experiments, we uncover a non-monotonic relationship between task complexity and the performance gap between ID and OOD data, which we term the generalization valley. Specifically, this phenomenon reveals a critical threshold - referred to as critical complexity - where reliance on non-generalizable behavior peaks, indicating the upper bound of LLMs' generalization capabilities. As model size increases, the critical complexity shifts toward higher levels of task complexity, suggesting that larger models can handle more complex reasoning tasks before over-relying on memorization. Leveraging Scylla and the concept of critical complexity, we benchmark 28LLMs including both open-sourced models such as LLaMA and Qwen families, and close-sourced models like Claude and GPT, providing a more robust evaluation and establishing a clearer understanding of LLMs' generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Empowering large language models (LLMs) to reason over tabular data represents an actively explored direction. However, since typical LLMs only support one-dimensional~(1D) inputs, existing methods often flatten the two-dimensional~(2D) table structure into a sequence of tokens, which can severely disrupt the spatial relationships and result in an inevitable loss of vital contextual information. In this paper, we first empirically demonstrate the detrimental impact of such flattening operations on the performance of LLMs in capturing the spatial information of tables through two elaborate proxy tasks. Subsequently, we introduce a simple yet effective positional encoding method, termed ``2D-TPE'' (Two-Dimensional Table Positional Encoding), to address this challenge. 2D-TPE enables each attention head to dynamically select a permutation order of tokens within the context for attending to them, where each permutation represents a distinct traversal mode for the table, such as column-wise or row-wise traversal. 2D-TPE effectively mitigates the risk of losing essential spatial information while preserving computational efficiency, thus better preserving the table structure. Extensive experiments across five benchmarks demonstrate that 2D-TPE outperforms strong baselines, underscoring the importance of preserving the table structure for accurate table comprehension. Comprehensive analysis further reveals the substantially better scalability of 2D-TPE to large tables than baselines.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by clinical consultations, ColaCare employs two types of agents: DoctorAgent and MetaAgent, which collaboratively analyze patient data. Expert models process and generate predictions from numerical EHR data, while LLM agents produce reasoning references and decision-making reports within the collaborative consultation framework. We additionally incorporate the Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy (MSD) medical guideline within a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) module for authoritative evidence support.

This study explores enhancing Vision Transformers (ViTs) for medical image segmentation by integrating pre-trained LLM transformer blocks. Our approach, which incorporates a frozen LLM transformer block into the encoder of a ViT-based model, leads to substantial improvements in segmentation performance across various medical imaging modalities. We propose a Hybrid Attention Mechanism that combines global and local feature learning with a Multi-Scale Fusion Block for aggregating features across different scales. The enhanced model shows significant performance gains, including an average Dice score increase from 0.74 to 0.79 and improvements in accuracy, precision, and the Jaccard Index. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of LLM-based transformers in refining medical image segmentation, highlighting their potential to significantly boost model accuracy and robustness.

However, the complexity of motion control and energy costs stack up quickly as the number of robots increases. In addressing this problem, our previous studies have formulated various methods employing macroscopic and microscopic approaches. These methods enable microscopic robots to adhere to a reference Gaussian mixture model (GMM) distribution observed at the macroscopic scale. As a result, optimizing the macroscopic level will result in an optimal overall result. However, all these methods require systematic and global generation of Gaussian components (GCs) within obstacle-free areas to construct the GMM trajectories. This work utilizes centroidal Voronoi tessellation to generate GCs methodically. Consequently, it demonstrates performance improvement while also ensuring consistency and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to American Control Conference (ACC) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Can Large Language Models Grasp Legal Theories? Enhance Legal Reasoning with Insights from Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02507v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) could struggle to fully understand legal theories and perform complex legal reasoning tasks. In this study, we introduce a challenging task (confusing charge prediction) to better evaluate LLMs' understanding of legal theories and reasoning capabilities. We also propose a novel framework: Multi-Agent framework for improving complex Legal Reasoning capability (MALR). MALR employs non-parametric learning, encouraging LLMs to automatically decompose complex legal tasks and mimic human learning process to extract insights from legal rules, helping LLMs better understand legal theories and enhance their legal reasoning abilities. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework effectively addresses complex reasoning issues in practical scenarios, paving the way for more reliable applications in the legal domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional Hardness of Code in Large Language Models -- A Probabilistic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18028v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common practice in large language model (LLM) usage for complex analytical tasks such as code generation, is to sample a solution for the entire task within the model's context window. Previous works have shown that subtask decomposition within the model's context (chain of thought), is beneficial for solving such tasks. In this work, we point a limitation of LLMs' ability to perform several sub-tasks within the same context window - an in-context hardness of composition, pointing to an advantage for distributing a decomposed problem in a multi-agent system of LLMs. The hardness of composition is quantified by a generation complexity metric, i.e., the number of LLM generations required to sample at least one correct solution. We find a gap between the generation complexity of solving a compositional problem within the same context relative to distributing it among multiple agents, that increases exponentially with the solution's length. We prove our results theoretically and demonstrate them empirically.</p></details> |  |

To address this question, we review standard definitions of knowledge in epistemology and we formalize interpretations applicable to LLMs. In doing so, we identify inconsistencies and gaps in how current NLP research conceptualizes knowledge with respect to epistemological frameworks. Additionally, we conduct a survey of 100 professional philosophers and computer scientists to compare their preferences in knowledge definitions and their views on whether LLMs can really be said to know. Finally, we suggest evaluation protocols for testing knowledge in accordance to the most relevant definitions.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |
| **[Graph Chain-of-Thought: Augmenting Large Language Models by Reasoning on Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07103v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), while exhibiting exceptional performance, suffer from hallucinations, especially on knowledge-intensive tasks. Existing works propose to augment LLMs with individual text units retrieved from external knowledge corpora to alleviate the issue. However, in many domains, texts are interconnected (e.g., academic papers in a bibliographic graph are linked by citations and co-authorships) which form a (text-attributed) graph. The knowledge in such graphs is encoded not only in single texts/nodes but also in their associated connections. To facilitate the research of augmenting LLMs with graphs, we manually construct a Graph Reasoning Benchmark dataset called GRBench, containing 1,740 questions that can be answered with the knowledge from 10 domain graphs. Then, we propose a simple and effective framework called Graph Chain-of-thought (Graph-CoT) to augment LLMs with graphs by encouraging LLMs to reason on the graph iteratively. Each Graph-CoT iteration consists of three sub-steps: LLM reasoning, LLM-graph interaction, and graph execution. We conduct systematic experiments with three LLM backbones on GRBench, where Graph-CoT outperforms the baselines consistently.

While several studies have explored autonomous approaches to distilling and annotating instructions from powerful proprietary LLMs, such as ChatGPT, they often neglect the impact of the distributions and characteristics of tasks, together with the varying difficulty of instructions in training sets. This oversight can lead to imbalanced knowledge capabilities and poor generalization powers of student LLMs. To address these challenges, we introduce Task-Aware Curriculum Planning for Instruction Refinement (TAPIR), a multi-round distillation framework that utilizes an oracle LLM to select instructions that are difficult for a student LLM to follow. To balance the student's capabilities, task distributions in training sets are adjusted with responses automatically refined according to their corresponding tasks. In addition, by incorporating curriculum planning, our approach systematically escalates the difficulty levels of tasks, progressively enhancing the student LLM's capabilities. We rigorously evaluate TAPIR using several widely recognized benchmarks (such as AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, etc.) and multiple student LLMs. Empirical results demonstrate that student LLMs, trained with our method and less training data, outperform larger instruction-tuned models and strong distillation baselines.</p></details> | emnlp 2024 findings |

| **[Large Language Models on Graphs: A Comprehensive Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02783v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT4 and LLaMA, are creating significant advancements in natural language processing, due to their strong text encoding/decoding ability and newly found emergent capability (e.g., reasoning). While LLMs are mainly designed to process pure texts, there are many real-world scenarios where text data is associated with rich structure information in the form of graphs (e.g., academic networks, and e-commerce networks) or scenarios where graph data is paired with rich textual information (e.g., molecules with descriptions). Besides, although LLMs have shown their pure text-based reasoning ability, it is underexplored whether such ability can be generalized to graphs (i.e., graph-based reasoning). In this paper, we provide a systematic review of scenarios and techniques related to large language models on graphs. We first summarize potential scenarios of adopting LLMs on graphs into three categories, namely pure graphs, text-attributed graphs, and text-paired graphs. We then discuss detailed techniques for utilizing LLMs on graphs, including LLM as Predictor, LLM as Encoder, and LLM as Aligner, and compare the advantages and disadvantages of different schools of models. Furthermore, we discuss the real-world applications of such methods and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude with potential future research directions in this fast-growing field.

Our hypothesis is that establishing an adequate output space can enable such a transition given the capabilities inherent in pre-trained LLMs. To verify this, we propose Response Tuning (RT), which eliminates the instruction-conditioning step in instruction tuning and solely focuses on response space supervision. Our experiments demonstrate that RT models, trained only using responses, can effectively respond to a wide range of instructions and exhibit helpfulness comparable to that of their instruction-tuned counterparts. Furthermore, we observe that controlling the training response distribution can significantly improve their user preference or elicit target behaviors such as refusing assistance for unsafe queries. Our findings illuminate the role of establishing an adequate output space in alignment, highlighting the potential of the extensive inherent capabilities of pre-trained LLMs.</p></details> | 34 pages |
| **[The SIFo Benchmark: Investigating the Sequential Instruction Following Ability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19999v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following multiple instructions is a crucial ability for large language models (LLMs). Evaluating this ability comes with significant challenges: (i) limited coherence between multiple instructions, (ii) positional bias where the order of instructions affects model performance, and (iii) a lack of objectively verifiable tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate models' abilities to follow multiple instructions through sequential instruction following (SIFo) tasks. In SIFo, the successful completion of multiple instructions is verifiable by examining only the final instruction. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following using four tasks (text modification, question answering, mathematics, and security rules), each assessing different aspects of sequential instruction following. Our evaluation of popular LLMs, both closed-source and open-source, shows that more recent and larger models significantly outperform their older and smaller counterparts on the SIFo tasks, validating the benchmark's effectiveness. All models struggle with following sequences of instructions, hinting at an important lack of robustness of today's language models.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

They are central tools for planning cost efficient actions to fight eutrophication since they allow scenario predictions on impacts of nutrient load reductions to, e.g., harmful algal biomass growth. Due to being computationally heavy, the uncertainties related to these predictions are typically not rigorously assessed though. In this work, we developed a novel Bayesian computational approach for estimating the uncertainties in predictions of the Finnish coastal nutrient load model FICOS. First, we constructed a likelihood function for the multivariate spatiotemporal outputs of the FICOS model. Then, we used Bayes optimization to locate the posterior mode for the model parameters conditional on long term monitoring data. After that, we constructed a space filling design for FICOS model runs around the posterior mode and used it to train a Gaussian process emulator for the (log) posterior density of the model parameters. We then integrated over this (approximate) parameter posterior to produce probabilistic predictions for algal biomass and chlorophyll a concentration under alternative nutrient load reduction scenarios. Our computational algorithm allowed for fast posterior inference and the Gaussian process emulator had good predictive accuracy within the highest posterior probability mass region. The posterior predictive scenarios showed that the probability to reach the EUs Water Framework Directive objectives in the Finnish Archipelago Sea is generally low even under large load reductions.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages and 7 figures</p></details> |

Inspired by human cognition, where perception is fundamental to reasoning, we explore augmenting LLMs with enhanced perception abilities using Internet of Things (IoT) sensor data and pertinent knowledge for IoT task reasoning in the physical world. In this work, we systematically study LLMs capability to address real-world IoT tasks by augmenting their perception and knowledge base, and then propose a unified framework, IoT-LLM, to enhance such capability. In IoT-LLM, we customize three steps for LLMs: preprocessing IoT data into formats amenable to LLMs, activating their commonsense knowledge through chain-of-thought prompting and specialized role definitions, and expanding their understanding via IoT-oriented retrieval-augmented generation based on in-context learning. To evaluate the performance, We design a new benchmark with five real-world IoT tasks with different data types and reasoning difficulties and provide the benchmarking results on six open-source and close-source LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate the limitations of existing LLMs with naive textual inputs that cannot perform these tasks effectively. We show that IoT-LLM significantly enhances the performance of IoT tasks reasoning of LLM, such as GPT-4, achieving an average improvement of 65% across various tasks against previous methods. The results also showcase LLMs ability to comprehend IoT data and the physical law behind data by providing a reasoning process. Limitations of our work are claimed to inspire future research in this new era.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 10 figures, submitted to ICLR 2025 Conference</p></details> |
| **[The Potential and Challenges of Evaluating Attitudes, Opinions, and Values in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11096v3)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked wide interest in validating and comprehending the human-like cognitive-behavioral traits LLMs may capture and convey. These cognitive-behavioral traits include typically Attitudes, Opinions, Values (AOVs). However, measuring AOVs embedded within LLMs remains opaque, and different evaluation methods may yield different results. This has led to a lack of clarity on how different studies are related to each other and how they can be interpreted. This paper aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive overview of recent works on the evaluation of AOVs in LLMs. Moreover, we survey related approaches in different stages of the evaluation pipeline in these works. By doing so, we address the potential and challenges with respect to understanding the model, human-AI alignment, and downstream application in social sciences. Finally, we provide practical insights into evaluation methods, model enhancement, and interdisciplinary collaboration, thereby contributing to the evolving landscape of evaluating AOVs in LLMs.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

However, the reliability of LLM evaluators is often compromised by their biased preferences, such as favoring verbosity and an authoritative tone. In this work, we find that the evaluation setup itself can significantly amplify these biases, where pairwise evaluators exhibit more undesirable tendencies than pointwise evaluators. Our analysis further reveals that even when pairwise evaluators make incorrect judgments, they can still accurately identify shortcomings in low-quality outputs. As a simple remedy, we also propose incorporating pointwise reasoning into pairwise evaluation. Experimental results show that our method improves the performance of pairwise evaluators on adversarial samples across various models. We hope our findings encourage further exploration into the reliability of LLM evaluators.</p></details> |  |

We focus on seven classification and seven generation tasks to evaluate the performance of these models on Urdu language. Urdu has 70 million native speakers, yet it remains underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Despite the frequent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), their performance in low-resource languages, including Urdu, still needs to be explored. We also conduct a human evaluation for the generation tasks and compare the results with the evaluations performed by GPT-4-Turbo, Llama-3-8b and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. We find that special-purpose models consistently outperform general-purpose models across various tasks. We also find that the evaluation done by GPT-4-Turbo for generation tasks aligns more closely with human evaluation compared to the evaluation the evaluation done by Llama-3-8b. This paper contributes to the NLP community by providing insights into the effectiveness of general and specific-purpose LLMs for low-resource languages.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce Temporal Grounding Bridge (TGB), a novel framework that bootstraps MLLMs with advanced temporal grounding capabilities and broadens their contextual scope. Our framework significantly enhances the temporal capabilities of current MLLMs through three key innovations: an efficient multi-span temporal grounding algorithm applied to low-dimension temporal features projected from flow; a multimodal length extrapolation training paradigm that utilizes low-dimension temporal features to extend the training context window size; and a bootstrapping framework that bridges our model with pluggable MLLMs without requiring annotation. We validate TGB across seven video benchmarks and demonstrate substantial performance improvements compared with prior MLLMs. Notably, our model, initially trained on sequences of four frames, effectively handles sequences up to 16 longer without sacrificing performance, highlighting its scalability and effectiveness in real-world applications.

They are trained on a simple objective: to predict the next token given the previous context. We live in a world where most of the data around us, e.g., text, audio, and music, has a multi-scale structure associated with it. This paper infuses LLMs with traditional signal processing ideas, namely wavelets, during pre-training to take advantage of the structure. Without adding \textbf{any extra parameters} to a GPT-style LLM architecture, we achieve the same pre-training performance almost twice as fast in text, raw audio, and symbolic music. This is achieved by imposing a structure on intermediate embeddings. When trained for the same number of training steps, we achieve significant gains in performance, which is comparable to pre-training a larger neural architecture. Our architecture allows every next token prediction access to intermediate embeddings at different temporal resolutions in every Transformer decoder block. This work will hopefully pave the way for incorporating multi-rate signal processing ideas into traditional LLM pre-training. Further, we showcase pushing model performance by improving internal structure instead of just going after scale.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

Spine imaging is an essential tool for noninvasively visualizing and assessing spinal pathology. Segmenting vertebrae in computed tomography (CT) images is the basis of quantitative medical image analysis for clinical diagnosis and surgery planning of spine diseases. Current publicly available annotated datasets on spinal vertebrae are small in size. Due to the lack of a large-scale annotated spine image dataset, the mainstream deep learning-based segmentation methods, which are data-driven, are heavily restricted. In this paper, we introduce a large-scale spine CT dataset, called CTSpine1K, curated from multiple sources for vertebra segmentation, which contains 1,005 CT volumes with over 11,100 labeled vertebrae belonging to different spinal conditions. Based on this dataset, we conduct several spinal vertebrae segmentation experiments to set the first benchmark. We believe that this large-scale dataset will facilitate further research in many spine-related image analysis tasks, including but not limited to vertebrae segmentation, labeling, 3D spine reconstruction from biplanar radiographs, image super-resolution, and enhancement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2024 Open Data for oral presentation and will be published as a part of the journal MELBA special issue</p></details> |

Many recent works exploit synthetic grasping datasets to learn to grasp unknown objects. However, those datasets were generated using simple grasp sampling methods using priors. Recently, Quality-Diversity (QD) algorithms have been proven to make grasp sampling significantly more efficient. In this work, we extend QDG-6DoF, a QD framework for generating object-centric grasps, to scale up the production of synthetic grasping datasets. We propose a data augmentation method that combines the transformation of object meshes with transfer learning from previous grasping repertoires. The conducted experiments show that this approach reduces the number of required evaluations per discovered robust grasp by up to 20%. We used this approach to generate QDGset, a dataset of 6DoF grasp poses that contains about 3.5 and 4.5 times more grasps and objects, respectively, than the previous state-of-the-art. Our method allows anyone to easily generate data, eventually contributing to a large-scale collaborative dataset of synthetic grasps.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 9 figures.

We assess the performance of LLMs in executing phrase semantic reasoning tasks guided by natural language instructions and explore the impact of common prompting techniques, including few-shot demonstrations and Chain-of-Thought reasoning. Our findings reveal that LLMs greatly outperform traditional embedding methods across the datasets; however, they do not show a significant advantage over fine-tuned methods. The effectiveness of advanced prompting strategies shows variability. We conduct detailed error analyses to interpret the limitations faced by LLMs in comprehending phrase semantics.

However, their randomness sometimes prevents algorithms from rapidly converging to global optimization, and the design of their genetic operators often requires complicated manual tuning. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes a new framework that combines a large language model (LLM) with traditional evolutionary algorithms to enhance the algorithm's search capability and generalization performance.In our framework, we employ adaptive and hybrid mechanisms to integrate the LLM with the MOEA, thereby accelerating algorithmic convergence. Specifically, we leverage an auxiliary evaluation function and automated prompt construction within the adaptive mechanism to flexibly adjust the utilization of the LLM, generating high-quality solutions that are further refined and optimized through genetic operators.Concurrently, the hybrid mechanism aims to minimize interaction costs with the LLM as much as possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreak Antidote: Runtime Safety-Utility Balance via Sparse Representation Adjustment in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02298v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to various applications, ensuring both their safety and utility is paramount. Jailbreak attacks, which manipulate LLMs into generating harmful content, pose significant challenges to this balance. Existing defenses, such as prompt engineering and safety fine-tuning, often introduce computational overhead, increase inference latency, and lack runtime flexibility. Moreover, overly restrictive safety measures can degrade model utility by causing refusals of benign queries. In this paper, we introduce Jailbreak Antidote, a method that enables real-time adjustment of LLM safety preferences by manipulating a sparse subset of the model's internal states during inference. By shifting the model's hidden representations along a safety direction with varying strengths, we achieve flexible control over the safety-utility balance without additional token overhead or inference delays. Our analysis reveals that safety-related information in LLMs is sparsely distributed; adjusting approximately 5% of the internal state is as effective as modifying the entire state. Extensive experiments on nine LLMs (ranging from 2 billion to 72 billion parameters), evaluated against ten jailbreak attack methods and compared with six defense strategies, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. By directly manipulating internal states during reasoning, Jailbreak Antidote offers a lightweight, scalable solution that enhances LLM safety while preserving utility, opening new possibilities for real-time safety mechanisms in widely-deployed AI systems.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

One notable consequence is the use of AI-generated images for fake profiles on social media. While several types of disinformation campaigns and similar incidents have been reported in the past, a systematic analysis has been lacking. In this work, we conduct the first large-scale investigation of the prevalence of AI-generated profile pictures on Twitter. We tackle the challenges of a real-world measurement study by carefully integrating various data sources and designing a multi-stage detection pipeline. Our analysis of nearly 15 million Twitter profile pictures shows that 0.052% were artificially generated, confirming their notable presence on the platform. We comprehensively examine the characteristics of these accounts and their tweet content, and uncover patterns of coordinated inauthentic behavior. The results also reveal several motives, including spamming and political amplification campaigns. Our research reaffirms the need for effective detection and mitigation strategies to cope with the potential negative effects of generative AI in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Symposium on Research in Attacks, Intrusions and Defenses (RAID), 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Analysis of Large Language Models as Soft Reasoners: The Case of Syllogistic Inferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11341v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming a central focus of study in NLP. In this paper, we consider the case of syllogistic reasoning, an area of deductive reasoning studied extensively in logic and cognitive psychology. Previous research has shown that pre-trained LLMs exhibit reasoning biases, such as $\textit{content effects}$, avoid answering that $\textit{no conclusion follows}$, display human-like difficulties, and struggle with multi-step reasoning. We contribute to this research line by systematically investigating the effects of chain-of-thought reasoning, in-context learning (ICL), and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on syllogistic reasoning, considering syllogisms with conclusions that support or violate world knowledge, as well as ones with multiple premises. Crucially, we go beyond the standard focus on accuracy, with an in-depth analysis of the conclusions generated by the models. Our results suggest that the behavior of pre-trained LLMs can be explained by heuristics studied in cognitive science and that both ICL and SFT improve model performance on valid inferences, although only the latter mitigates most reasoning biases without harming model consistency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for acquiring large-scale intentions bank on distilling large language models with human annotation for verification. Such an approach tends to generate product-centric intentions, overlook valuable visual information from product images, and incurs high costs for scalability. To address these issues, we introduce MIND, a multimodal framework that allows Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) to infer purchase intentions from multimodal product metadata and prioritize human-centric ones. Using Amazon Review data, we apply MIND and create a multimodal intention knowledge base, which contains 1,264,441 million intentions derived from 126,142 co-buy shopping records across 107,215 products. Extensive human evaluations demonstrate the high plausibility and typicality of our obtained intentions and validate the effectiveness of our distillation framework and filtering mechanism. Additional experiments reveal that our obtained intentions significantly enhance large language models in two intention comprehension tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, enhancing reasoning abilities in LLMs, particularly via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality preference data, which is labor-intensive to annotate and crucial for reward model (RM) finetuning. To alleviate this issue, we introduce CodePMP, a scalable preference model pretraining (PMP) pipeline that utilizes a large corpus of synthesized code-preference pairs from publicly available high-quality source code. CodePMP improves RM finetuning efficiency by pretraining preference models on large-scale synthesized code-preference pairs. We evaluate CodePMP on mathematical reasoning tasks (GSM8K, MATH) and logical reasoning tasks (ReClor, LogiQA2.0), consistently showing significant improvements in reasoning performance of LLMs and highlighting the importance of scalable preference model pretraining for efficient reward modeling.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Extending Context Window of Large Language Models from a Distributional Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01490v2)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling the rotary position embedding (RoPE) has become a common method for extending the context window of RoPE-based large language models (LLMs). However, existing scaling methods often rely on empirical approaches and lack a profound understanding of the internal distribution within RoPE, resulting in suboptimal performance in extending the context window length. In this paper, we propose to optimize the context window extending task from the view of rotary angle distribution. Specifically, we first estimate the distribution of the rotary angles within the model and analyze the extent to which length extension perturbs this distribution. Then, we present a novel extension strategy that minimizes the disturbance between rotary angle distributions to maintain consistency with the pre-training phase, enhancing the model's capability to generalize to longer sequences. Experimental results compared to the strong baseline methods demonstrate that our approach reduces by up to 72% of the distributional disturbance when extending LLaMA2's context window to 8k, and reduces by up to 32% when extending to 16k. On the LongBench-E benchmark, our method achieves an average improvement of up to 4.33% over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, Our method maintains the model's performance on the Hugging Face Open LLM benchmark after context window extension, with only an average performance fluctuation ranging from -0.12 to +0.22.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, Accepted to EMNLP2024</p></details> |
| **[EmbedLLM: Learning Compact Representations of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02223v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With hundreds of thousands of language models available on Huggingface today, efficiently evaluating and utilizing these models across various downstream, tasks has become increasingly critical. Many existing methods repeatedly learn task-specific representations of Large Language Models (LLMs), which leads to inefficiencies in both time and computational resources. To address this, we propose EmbedLLM, a framework designed to learn compact vector representations, of LLMs that facilitate downstream applications involving many models, such as model routing. We introduce an encoder-decoder approach for learning such embeddings, along with a systematic framework to evaluate their effectiveness. Empirical results show that EmbedLLM outperforms prior methods in model routing both in accuracy and latency. Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can forecast a model's performance on multiple benchmarks, without incurring additional inference cost. Extensive probing experiments validate that the learned embeddings capture key model characteristics, e.g. whether the model is specialized for coding tasks, even without being explicitly trained on them. We open source our dataset, code and embedder to facilitate further research and application.</p></details> |  |

| **[Measuring, Evaluating and Improving Logical Consistency in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02205v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown promising progress related to LLM alignment with human preferences. LLM-empowered decision-making systems are expected to be predictable, reliable and trustworthy, which implies being free from paradoxes or contradictions that could undermine their credibility and validity. However, LLMs still exhibit inconsistent and biased behaviour when making decisions or judgements. In this work, we focus on studying logical consistency of LLMs as a prerequisite for more reliable and trustworthy systems. Logical consistency ensures that decisions are based on a stable and coherent understanding of the problem, reducing the risk of erratic or contradictory outputs. We first propose a universal framework to quantify the logical consistency via three fundamental proxies: transitivity, commutativity and negation invariance. We then evaluate logical consistency, using the defined measures, of a wide range of LLMs, demonstrating that it can serve as a strong proxy for overall robustness. Additionally, we introduce a data refinement and augmentation technique that enhances the logical consistency of LLMs without sacrificing alignment to human preferences. It augments noisy and sparse pairwise-comparison annotations by estimating a partially or totally ordered preference rankings using rank aggregation methods. Finally, we show that logical consistency impacts the performance of LLM-based logic-dependent algorithms, where LLMs serve as logical operators.</p></details> |  |

This encoding converts complex molecular graphs into tree-structured formats, such as JSON and XML, which LLMs are particularly adept at processing due to their extensive pre-training on these types of data. By leveraging the flexibility of LLMs, our approach allows for intuitive interaction using natural language prompts, providing a more accessible interface for molecular design. Through supervised fine-tuning, G2T-LLM generates valid and coherent chemical structures, addressing common challenges like invalid outputs seen in traditional graph-based methods. While LLMs are computationally intensive, they offer superior generalization and adaptability, enabling the generation of diverse molecular structures with minimal task-specific customization. The proposed approach achieved comparable performances with state-of-the-art methods on various benchmark molecular generation datasets, demonstrating its potential as a flexible and innovative tool for AI-driven molecular design.</p></details> |  |
| **[POSIX: A Prompt Sensitivity Index For Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02185v1)** | 2024-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their remarkable capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) are found to be surprisingly sensitive to minor variations in prompts, often generating significantly divergent outputs in response to minor variations in the prompts, such as spelling errors, alteration of wording or the prompt template. However, while assessing the quality of an LLM, the focus often tends to be solely on its performance on downstream tasks, while very little to no attention is paid to prompt sensitivity. To fill this gap, we propose POSIX - a novel PrOmpt Sensitivity IndeX as a reliable measure of prompt sensitivity, thereby offering a more comprehensive evaluation of LLM performance. The key idea behind POSIX is to capture the relative change in loglikelihood of a given response upon replacing the corresponding prompt with a different intent-preserving prompt. We provide thorough empirical evidence demonstrating the efficacy of POSIX in capturing prompt sensitivity and subsequently use it to measure and thereby compare prompt sensitivity of various open-source LLMs. We find that merely increasing the parameter count or instruction tuning does not necessarily reduce prompt sensitivity whereas adding some few-shot exemplars, even just one, almost always leads to significant decrease in prompt sensitivity. We also find that alterations to prompt template lead to the highest sensitivity in the case of MCQtype tasks, whereas paraphrasing results in the highest sensitivity in open-ended generation tasks. The code for reproducing our results is open-sourced at https://github.com/kowndinyarenduchintala/POSIX.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, how to reliably evaluate code generated by LLMs remains an unresolved problem. This paper presents CodeJudge, a code evaluation framework that leverages LLMs to evaluate the semantic correctness of generated code without the need for test cases. We investigate different ways to guide the LLM in performing "slow thinking" to arrive at an in-depth and reliable evaluation. We experimented with four LLMs as evaluators on four code generation datasets and five programming languages. The results show that CodeJudge significantly outperformed existing methods in most settings.

Despite increasing empirical evidence and intuitive understanding, a formal mathematical justification for the behavior of such models, particularly regarding overfitting, remains incomplete. In this paper, we propose a general regularization framework to study the Mean Integrated Squared Error (MISE) of neural networks. This framework includes many commonly used neural networks and penalties, such as ReLu and Sigmoid activations and $L^1$, $L^2$ penalties. Based on our frameworks, we find the MISE curve has two possible shapes, namely the shape of double descents and monotone decreasing. The latter phenomenon is new in literature and the causes of these two phenomena are also studied in theory. These studies challenge conventional statistical modeling frameworks and broadens recent findings on the double descent phenomenon in neural networks.</p></details> |  |

Accessibility to computing resources remains a barrier for the open-source community. To address this challenge, we propose the In2Core algorithm, which selects a coreset by analyzing the correlation between training and evaluation samples with a trained model. Notably, we assess the model's internal gradients to estimate this relationship, aiming to rank the contribution of each training point. To enhance efficiency, we propose an optimization to compute influence functions with a reduced number of layers while achieving similar accuracy. By applying our algorithm to instruction fine-tuning data of LLMs, we can achieve similar performance with just 50% of the training data. Meantime, using influence functions to analyze model coverage to certain testing samples could provide a reliable and interpretable signal on the training set's coverage of those test points.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 - Findings</p></details> |

We consider whether these models have sufficiently robust and expressive representation spaces to enable "training-free" classification. Specifically, we utilize various state-of-the-art video encoders to extract features for use in k-nearest neighbors classification, where the training data points are derived from synthetic videos only. We compare these results with another training-free approach -- zero-shot classification using text descriptions of each gesture. In our experiments with the RoCoG-v2 dataset, we find that using synthetic training videos yields significantly lower classification accuracy on real test videos compared to using a relatively small number of real training videos. We also observe that video backbones that were fine-tuned on classification tasks serve as superior feature extractors, and that the choice of fine-tuning data has a substantial impact on k-nearest neighbors performance. Lastly, we find that zero-shot text-based classification performs poorly on the gesture recognition task, as gestures are not easily described through natural language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Synth...</summary><p>Synthetic Data for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning: Tools, Techniques, and Applications II (SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing, 2024)</p></details> |

LMODincludes 21,993 images spanning optical coherence tomography, scanning laser ophthalmoscopy, eye photos, surgical scenes, and color fundus photographs. We benchmark 13 state-of-the-art LVLMs and find that they are far from perfect for comprehending ophthalmology images. Models struggle with diagnostic analysis and demographic extraction, reveal weaknesses in spatial reasoning, diagnostic analysis, handling out-of-domain queries, and safeguards for handling biomarkers of ophthalmology images.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, the resilience of LLMs to handle text containing inherent errors, stemming from human interactions and collaborative systems, has not been thoroughly explored. Our study investigates the resilience of LLMs against five common types of disruptions including 1) ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) errors, 2) OCR (Optical Character Recognition) errors, 3) grammatical mistakes, 4) typographical errors, and 5) distractive content. We aim to investigate how these models react by deliberately embedding these errors into instructions. Our findings reveal that while some LLMs show a degree of resistance to certain types of noise, their overall performance significantly suffers. This emphasizes the importance of further investigation into enhancing model resilience. In response to the observed decline in performance, our study also evaluates a "re-pass" strategy, designed to purify the instructions of noise before the LLMs process them. Our analysis indicates that correcting noisy instructions, particularly for open-source LLMs, presents significant challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |

They are prone to overfit into the unexpected patterns or superficial styles in the training data. We conduct an empirical study that only selects the top-10\% most updated parameters in LLMs for alignment training, and see improvements in the convergence process and final performance. It indicates the existence of redundant neurons in LLMs for alignment training. To reduce its influence, we propose a low-redundant alignment method named \textbf{ALLO}, focusing on optimizing the most related neurons with the most useful supervised signals. Concretely, we first identify the neurons that are related to the human preference data by a gradient-based strategy, then identify the alignment-related key tokens by reward models for computing loss. Besides, we also decompose the alignment process into the forgetting and learning stages, where we first forget the tokens with unaligned knowledge and then learn aligned knowledge, by updating different ratios of neurons, respectively. Experimental results on 10 datasets have shown the effectiveness of ALLO.

Unfortunately, the study concluded that the LLMs could not self-correct reasoning yet. We find that a simple yet effective verification method can unleash inherent capabilities of the LLMs. That is to mask a key condition in the question, add the current response to construct a verification question, and predict the condition to verify the response. The condition can be an entity in an open-domain question or a numeric value in a math question, which requires minimal effort (via prompting) to identify. We propose an iterative verify-then-correct framework to progressively identify and correct (probably) false responses, named ProCo. We conduct experiments on three reasoning tasks. On average, ProCo, with GPT-3.5-Turbo as the backend LLM, yields $+6.8$ exact match on four open-domain question answering datasets, $+14.1$ accuracy on three arithmetic reasoning datasets, and $+9.6$ accuracy on a commonsense reasoning dataset, compared to Self-Correct.

We introduce RULEARN, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess the rule-learning abilities of LLM agents in interactive settings. In RULEARN, agents strategically interact with simulated environments to gather observations, discern patterns, and solve complex problems. To enhance the rule-learning capabilities for LLM agents, we propose IDEA, a novel reasoning framework that integrates the process of Induction, Deduction, and Abduction. The IDEA agent generates initial hypotheses from limited observations through abduction, devises plans to validate these hypotheses or leverages them to solve problems via deduction, and refines previous hypotheses using patterns identified from new observations through induction, dynamically establishing and applying rules that mimic human rule-learning behaviors. Our evaluation of the IDEA framework, which involves five representative LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements over the baseline. Furthermore, within this framework, our comparison with 50 human participants reveals notable discrepancies in rule-learning behaviors. LLM agents tend to generate plausible initial hypotheses but struggle to refine them through interaction. Conversely, humans, despite sometimes overlooking initial details, excel at incorporating feedback and continuously improving their hypotheses. We believe our benchmark, RULEARN, will serve as a valuable and challenging resource, and that the IDEA framework will provide crucial insights for the development of LLM agents capable of human-like rule learning in real-world scenarios. We will release our code and data upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

We critically evaluate this replacement perspective to appraise the fundamental utility of language models in psychology and social science. Through a five-dimension framework, characterization, representation, interpretation, implication, and utility, we identify six fallacies that undermine the replacement perspective: (1) equating token prediction with human intelligence, (2) assuming LLMs represent the average human, (3) interpreting alignment as explanation, (4) anthropomorphizing AI, (5) essentializing identities, and (6) purporting LLMs as primary tools that directly reveal the human mind. Rather than replacement, the evidence and arguments are consistent with a simulation perspective, where LLMs offer a new paradigm to simulate roles and model cognitive processes. We highlight limitations and considerations about internal, external, construct, and statistical validity, providing methodological guidelines for effective integration of LLMs into psychological research, with a focus on model selection, prompt design, interpretation, and ethical considerations. This perspective reframes the role of language models in behavioral and cognitive science, serving as linguistic simulators and cognitive models that shed light on the similarities and differences between machine intelligence and human cognition and thoughts.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 3 tables, 2 boxes</p></details> |

Despite the significant advancements of large language models (LLMs) in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their capability in string processing remains underexplored and underdeveloped. To bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive study of LLMs' string processing capability. In particular, we first propose StringLLM, a method to construct datasets for benchmarking string processing capability of LLMs. We use StringLLM to build a series of datasets, referred to as StringBench. It encompasses a wide range of string processing tasks, allowing us to systematically evaluate LLMs' performance in this area. Our evaluations indicate that LLMs struggle with accurately processing strings compared to humans. To uncover the underlying reasons for this limitation, we conduct an in-depth analysis and subsequently propose an effective approach that significantly enhances LLMs' string processing capability via fine-tuning. This work provides a foundation for future research to understand LLMs' string processing capability. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/wxl-lxw/StringLLM.</p></details> |  |

However, we know very little about the algorithms that a model employs to implement this capability, nor do we understand their failure modes. For example, given the prompt "John is going fishing, so he walks over to the bank. Can he make an ATM transaction?", a model may incorrectly respond "Yes" if it has not properly contextualized "bank" as a geographical feature, rather than a financial institution. We propose the LLM Race Conditions Hypothesis as an explanation of contextualization errors of this form. This hypothesis identifies dependencies between tokens (e.g., "bank" must be properly contextualized before the final token, "?", integrates information from "bank"), and claims that contextualization errors are a result of violating these dependencies. Using a variety of techniques from mechanistic intepretability, we provide correlational and causal evidence in support of the hypothesis, and suggest inference-time interventions to address it.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to operate as world models. Although LLMs are not inherently designed to model real-world dynamics, we show that they can be induced to perform two critical world model functions: determining the applicability of an action based on a given world state, and predicting the resulting world state upon action execution. This is achieved by fine-tuning two separate LLMs-one for precondition prediction and another for effect prediction-while leveraging synthetic data generation techniques. Through human-participant studies, we validate that the precondition and effect knowledge generated by our models aligns with human understanding of world dynamics. We also analyze the extent to which the world model trained on our synthetic data results in an inferred state space that supports the creation of action chains, a necessary property for planning.</p></details> |  |

The system's architecture integrates advanced data processing, intelligent domain pairing, and LLM-powered threat assessment. Crucially, DomainLynx incorporates specialized components that mitigate LLM hallucinations, ensuring reliable and context-aware detection. This approach enables efficient analysis of vast security data from diverse sources, including Certificate Transparency logs, Passive DNS records, and zone files. Evaluated on a curated dataset of 1,649 squatting domains, DomainLynx achieved 94.7\% accuracy using Llama-3-70B.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework to generate synthetic tabular data, powered by large language models (LLMs) that emulates the architecture of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). By incorporating data generation process as contextual information and utilizing LLM as the optimizer, our approach significantly enhance the quality of synthetic data generation in common scenarios with small sample sizes. Our experimental results on public and private datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-art models regarding generating higher quality synthetic data for downstream tasks while keeping privacy of the real data.</p></details> |  |

However, this overlooks the intersection of multiple abilities across different types of expertise that are often required for real-world tasks, which we term cross capabilities. To systematically explore this concept, we first define seven core individual capabilities and then pair them to form seven common cross capabilities, each supported by a manually constructed taxonomy. Building on these definitions, we introduce CrossEval, a benchmark comprising 1,400 human-annotated prompts, with 100 prompts for each individual and cross capability. To ensure reliable evaluation, we involve expert annotators to assess 4,200 model responses, gathering 8,400 human ratings with detailed explanations to serve as reference examples. Our findings reveal that, in both static evaluations and attempts to enhance specific abilities, current LLMs consistently exhibit the "Law of the Weakest Link," where cross-capability performance is significantly constrained by the weakest component. Specifically, across 58 cross-capability scores from 17 models, 38 scores are lower than all individual capabilities, while 20 fall between strong and weak, but closer to the weaker ability. These results highlight the under-performance of LLMs in cross-capability tasks, making the identification and improvement of the weakest capabilities a critical priority for future research to optimize performance in complex, multi-dimensional scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Data,...</summary><p>Data, Code, & Benchmark: www.llm-cross-capabilities.org</p></details> |

Unlike traditional methods that rely on categorical event type representations, TPP-LLM directly utilizes the textual descriptions of event types, enabling the model to capture rich semantic information embedded in the text. While LLMs excel at understanding event semantics, they are less adept at capturing temporal patterns. To address this, TPP-LLM incorporates temporal embeddings and employs parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods to effectively learn temporal dynamics without extensive retraining. This approach improves both predictive accuracy and computational efficiency. Experimental results across diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that TPP-LLM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in sequence modeling and event prediction, highlighting the benefits of combining LLMs with TPPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing Criteria Development Across Domain Experts, Lay Users, and Models in Large Language Model Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02054v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for domain-specific tasks, yet integrating domain expertise into evaluating their outputs remains challenging. A common approach to evaluating LLMs is to use metrics, or criteria, which are assertions used to assess performance that help ensure that their outputs align with domain-specific standards. Previous efforts have involved developers, lay users, or the LLMs themselves in creating these criteria, however, evaluation particularly from a domain expertise perspective, remains understudied. This study explores how domain experts contribute to LLM evaluation by comparing their criteria with those generated by LLMs and lay users. We further investigate how the criteria-setting process evolves, analyzing changes between a priori and a posteriori stages. Our findings emphasize the importance of involving domain experts early in the evaluation process while utilizing complementary strengths of lay users and LLMs. We suggest implications for designing workflows that leverage these strengths at different evaluation stages.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Edit Intent Classification in Scientific Document Revisions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02028v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classification is a core NLP task architecture with many potential applications. While large language models (LLMs) have brought substantial advancements in text generation, their potential for enhancing classification tasks remains underexplored. To address this gap, we propose a framework for thoroughly investigating fine-tuning LLMs for classification, including both generation- and encoding-based approaches. We instantiate this framework in edit intent classification (EIC), a challenging and underexplored classification task. Our extensive experiments and systematic comparisons with various training approaches and a representative selection of LLMs yield new insights into their application for EIC. We investigate the generalizability of these findings on five further classification tasks. To demonstrate the proposed methods and address the data shortage for empirical edit analysis, we use our best-performing EIC model to create Re3-Sci2.0, a new large-scale dataset of 1,780 scientific document revisions with over 94k labeled edits. The quality of the dataset is assessed through human evaluation. The new dataset enables an in-depth empirical study of human editing behavior in academic writing. We make our experimental framework, models and data publicly available.</p></details> | EMNLP2024 Main |

Nowadays, fine-tuning has become the most popular method for adapting a model to practical usage by significantly increasing accuracy on downstream tasks. Despite the great accuracy it achieves, we found fine-tuning is still far away from satisfactory trustworthiness due to "tuning-induced mis-calibration". In this paper, we delve deeply into why and how mis-calibration exists in fine-tuned models, and how distillation can alleviate the issue. Then we further propose a brand new method named Efficient Trustworthy Distillation (FIRST), which utilizes a small portion of teacher's knowledge to obtain a reliable language model in a cost-efficient way. Specifically, we identify the "concentrated knowledge" phenomenon during distillation, which can significantly reduce the computational burden. Then we apply a "trustworthy maximization" process to optimize the utilization of this small portion of concentrated knowledge before transferring it to the student. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, where better accuracy (+2.3%) and less mis-calibration (-10%) are achieved on average across both in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, indicating better trustworthiness.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |
| **[Adaptively Private Next-Token Prediction of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02016v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) proliferate, developing privacy safeguards for these models is crucial. One popular safeguard involves training LLMs in a differentially private manner. However, such solutions are shown to be computationally expensive and detrimental to the utility of these models. Since LLMs are deployed on the cloud and thus only accessible via an API, a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) provider can protect its downstream data by privatizing the predictions during the decoding process. However, the practicality of such solutions still largely lags behind DP training methods. One recent promising approach, Private Mixing of Ensemble Distributions (PMixED), avoids additive noise by sampling from the output distributions of private LLMs mixed with the output distribution of a public model. Yet, PMixED must satisfy a fixed privacy level for a given number of queries, which is difficult for an analyst to estimate before inference and, hence, does not scale. To this end, we relax the requirements to a more practical setting by introducing Adaptive PMixED (AdaPMixED), a private decoding framework based on PMixED that is adaptive to the private and public output distributions evaluated on a given input query. In this setting, we introduce a noisy screening mechanism that filters out queries with potentially expensive privacy loss, and a data-dependent analysis that exploits the divergence of the private and public output distributions in its privacy loss calculation. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that our mechanism and analysis can reduce the privacy loss by 16x while preserving the utility over the original PMixED. Furthermore, performing 100K predictions with AdaPMixED still achieves strong utility and a reasonable data-dependent privacy loss of 5.25.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Effect of Sampling Temperature on Problem Solving in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05201v3)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this research study, we empirically investigate the effect of sampling temperature on the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on various problem-solving tasks. We created a multiple-choice question-and-answer (MCQA) exam by randomly sampling problems from standard LLM benchmarks. Then, we used nine popular LLMs with five prompt-engineering techniques to solve the MCQA problems while increasing the sampling temperature from 0.0 to 1.6. Despite anecdotal reports to the contrary, our empirical results indicate that changes in temperature from 0.0 to 1.0 do not have a statistically significant impact on LLM performance for problem-solving tasks. In addition, these results appear to generalize across LLMs, prompt-engineering techniques, and problem domains.

Early detection and accurate classification of DFUs are critical for preventing serious complications, yet many patients experience delays in receiving care due to limited access to specialized services. Telehealth has emerged as a promising solution, improving access to care and reducing the need for in-person visits. The integration of artificial intelligence and pattern recognition into telemedicine has further enhanced DFU management by enabling automatic detection, classification, and monitoring from images. Despite advancements in artificial intelligence-driven approaches for DFU image analysis, the application of large language models for DFU image transcription has not yet been explored. To address this gap, we introduce UlcerGPT, a novel multimodal approach leveraging large language and vision models for DFU image transcription. This framework combines advanced vision and language models, such as Large Language and Vision Assistant and Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer, to transcribe DFU images by jointly detecting, classifying, and localizing regions of interest. Through detailed experiments on a public dataset, evaluated by expert clinicians, UlcerGPT demonstrates promising results in the accuracy and efficiency of DFU transcription, offering potential support for clinicians in delivering timely care via telemedicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, ICPR 2024 Conference (PRHA workshop)</p></details> |

The advent of large language models (LLMs) such as BERT and its financial variant, FinBERT, has notably enhanced sentiment analysis capabilities. This paper investigates the application of LLMs and FinBERT for FSA, comparing their performance on news articles, financial reports and company announcements. The study emphasizes the advantages of prompt engineering with zero-shot and few-shot strategy to improve sentiment classification accuracy. Experimental results indicate that GPT-4o, with few-shot examples of financial texts, can be as competent as a well fine-tuned FinBERT in this specialized field.</p></details> |  |
| **[SORSA: Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors Adaptation of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00055v4)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement in large language models (LLMs) comes with a significant increase in their parameter size, presenting challenges for adaptation and fine-tuning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to adapt LLMs for downstream tasks efficiently. In this paper, we propose Singular Values and Orthonormal Regularized Singular Vectors Adaptation, or SORSA, a novel PEFT method. We introduce a method to analyze the variation of the parameters by performing singular value decomposition (SVD) and discuss and analyze SORSA's superiority in minimizing the alteration in the SVD aspect. Each SORSA adapter consists of two main parts: trainable principal singular weights $W_p = U_p \text{diag}(S_p) V^\top_p$, and frozen residual weights $W_r = U_r \text{diag}(S_r) V^\top_r$. These parts are initialized by performing SVD on pre-trained weights. Moreover, we implement and analyze an orthonormal regularizer, which we prove could decrease the condition number of $W_p$ and allows the optimization to be more efficient. SORSA adapters could be merged during inference, thus eliminating any inference latency. After all, SORSA shows a faster convergence than PiSSA and LoRA in our experiments. On the GSM-8K benchmark, Llama 2 7B adapted using SORSA achieved 56.03% accuracy, surpassing LoRA (42.30%), Full FT (49.05%), and PiSSA (53.07%). On the MATH benchmark, SORSA achieved 10.36% accuracy, outperforming LoRA (5.50%), Full FT (7.22%), and PiSSA (7.44%). We conclude that SORSA offers a new perspective on parameter-efficient fine-tuning, demonstrating remarkable performance.

In this paper, we propose TypedThinker, a novel framework that enhances LLMs' problem-solving abilities by incorporating multiple reasoning types (deductive, inductive, abductive, and analogical). Our analysis across four benchmarks reveals that different reasoning types uniquely solve distinct sets of problems, highlighting the importance of diverse thinking approaches. TypedThinker addresses two key challenges: selecting appropriate reasoning types for given problems and effectively implementing specific reasoning types. Through self-training on successful experiences, TypedThinker learns an implicit policy for reasoning type selection and application. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models, with accuracy increases of 3.4% for Mistral 7B and 16.7% for LLaMA3 8B across four reasoning benchmarks. Notably, TypedThinker shows effective generalization to new benchmarks and can further enhance the reasoning capability of powerful models like GPT-4o.

However, traditional DP training is computationally expensive, and can hurt model performance. Our study explores DP parameter-efficient fine-tuning as a way to mitigate privacy risks with smaller computation and performance costs for ASR models. Through extensive experimentation and progressive optimization, we achieve 4.6%/8.1% word error rate on LibriSpeech clean/other test-sets, setting a new performance benchmark while maintaining (10, 3.52e-6)-DP in fine-tuning a large ASR model with over 600M parameters.</p></details> |  |

The pioneering scaling law on downstream works demonstrated intrinsic similarities within model families and utilized such similarities for performance prediction. However, they tend to overlook the similarities between model families and only consider design factors listed in the original scaling law. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel framework, Collaborative Performance Prediction (CPP), which significantly enhances prediction accuracy by leveraging the historical performance of various models on downstream tasks and other design factors for both model and task. We also collect a collaborative data sourced from online platforms containing both historical performance and additional design factors. With the support of the collaborative data, CPP not only surpasses traditional scaling laws in predicting the performance of scaled LLMs but also facilitates a detailed analysis of factor importance, an area previously overlooked.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of EMNLP 2024 Main Track</p></details> |

The code of nature, hidden in diverse genomes since the very beginning of life's evolution, holds immense potential for impacting humans and ecosystems through genome modeling. Recent breakthroughs in GFMs, such as Evo, have attracted significant investment and attention to genomic modeling, as they address long-standing challenges and transform in-silico genomic studies into automated, reliable, and efficient paradigms. In the context of this flourishing era of consecutive technological revolutions in genomics, GFM studies face two major challenges: the lack of GFM benchmarking tools and the absence of open-source software for diverse genomics. These challenges hinder the rapid evolution of GFMs and their wide application in tasks such as understanding and synthesizing genomes, problems that have persisted for decades. To address these challenges, we introduce GFMBench, a framework dedicated to GFM-oriented benchmarking. GFMBench standardizes benchmark suites and automates benchmarking for a wide range of open-source GFMs. It integrates millions of genomic sequences across hundreds of genomic tasks from four large-scale benchmarks, democratizing GFMs for a wide range of in-silico genomic applications. Additionally, GFMBench is released as open-source software, offering user-friendly interfaces and diverse tutorials, applicable for AutoBench and complex tasks like RNA design and structure prediction. To facilitate further advancements in genome modeling, we have launched a public leaderboard showcasing the benchmark performance derived from AutoBench. GFMBench represents a step toward standardizing GFM benchmarking and democratizing GFM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/yangheng95/OmniGenomeBench</p></details> |

Open-RAG uniquely trains the model to navigate challenging distractors that appear relevant but are misleading. As a result, Open-RAG leverages latent learning, dynamically selecting relevant experts and integrating external knowledge effectively for more accurate and contextually relevant responses. In addition, we propose a hybrid adaptive retrieval method to determine retrieval necessity and balance the trade-off between performance gain and inference speed. Experimental results show that the Llama2-7B-based Open-RAG outperforms state-of-the-art LLMs and RAG models such as ChatGPT, Self-RAG, and Command R+ in various knowledge-intensive tasks.

However, training on large VL datasets can become prohibitively expensive. In this work, we introduce COINCIDE, an effective and scalable data selection technique that uses a small model as a reference model to select visual instruction tuning data for efficient finetuning of a target LVLM, focusing on diversity and transferability. Specifically, we cluster the training data using internal activations from a small model, which identifies VL concept-skill compositions needed by a target LVLM. We then sample data from these diverse clusters by considering their density and transferability, or the ability to transfer well to other concept-skill compositions. This approach ensures the diversity of these compositions, which is vital for LVLM generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that COINCIDE achieves superior performance and data selection efficiency against 8 strong baselines on two distinct datasets: LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan. Using only 20% of the LLaVA-1.5 dataset, COINCIDE achieves performance comparable to the LVLM finetuned on the whole dataset, with 70% reduction of the wall-clock running time. On the Vision-Flan dataset, our method achieves superior results with only 16.7% of the training data.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 |

However, the precise definition of style and the relationship between style, data quality, and LLM performance remains unclear. This research identifies two key stylistic elements in responses: linguistic form and semantic surprisal. We find that, among training data of comparable quality, higher consistency in these response elements leads to better LLM performance. Inspired by this, we introduce Style Consistency-Aware Response Ranking (SCAR), which automatically prioritizes instruction-response pairs in the training set based on their response stylistic consistency. By selecting the most style-consistent examples, sometimes as few as 0.7% of the full dataset, the fine-tuned LLMs can match or even surpass the performance of models trained on the entire dataset in coding and open-ended question-answering benchmarks. Code and data are available at https://github.com/zhuang-li/SCAR .</p></details> | 27 pages |

Despite LLMs' prowess in tasks like writing assistance, code generation, and machine translation, assessing their ability to reason has been challenging. Traditional evaluations often prioritize accuracy on downstream tasks over direct assessments of reasoning processes. LogicAsker addresses this gap by employing a set of atomic reasoning skills grounded in propositional and predicate logic to systematically examine and improve the reasoning prowess of LLMs. Our methodology reveals significant gaps in LLMs' learning of logical rules, with identified reasoning failures ranging from 29\% to 90\% across different models. Moreover, we leverage these findings to construct targeted demonstration examples and fine-tune data, notably enhancing logical reasoning in models like GPT-4o by up to 5\%. To our knowledge, this is the first effort to utilize test case outcomes to effectively refine LLMs' formal reasoning capabilities. We make our code, data, and results publicly available (https://github.com/yxwan123/LogicAsker) to facilitate further research and replication of our findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

Moreover, the emergence threshold roughly coincides with the point at which performance on easy questions reverts from inverse scaling to standard scaling.

However, their reliability is hindered by issues of hallucination and generating non-factual content. This is particularly problematic in long-form responses, where assessing and ensuring factual accuracy is complex. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing FactAlign, a novel alignment framework designed to enhance the factuality of LLMs' long-form responses while maintaining their helpfulness. We introduce fKTO, a fine-grained, sentence-level alignment algorithm that extends the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) alignment method. Leveraging recent advances in automatic factuality evaluation, FactAlign utilizes fine-grained factuality assessments to guide the alignment process. Our experiments on open-domain prompts and information-seeking questions demonstrate that FactAlign significantly improves the factual accuracy of LLM responses while also improving their helpfulness. Further analyses identify that FactAlign is capable of training LLMs to provide more information without losing factual precision, thus improving the factual F1 score.

Studies suggest that powerful LLMs, like GPT-4, are beginning to exhibit human-like cognitive abilities, including planning, reasoning, and reflection. In this paper, we introduce a research line and methodology called LLM Psychology, leveraging human psychology experiments to investigate the cognitive behaviors and mechanisms of LLMs. We migrate the Typoglycemia phenomenon from psychology to explore the "mind" of LLMs. Unlike human brains, which rely on context and word patterns to comprehend scrambled text, LLMs use distinct encoding and decoding processes. Through Typoglycemia experiments at the character, word, and sentence levels, we observe: (I) LLMs demonstrate human-like behaviors on a macro scale, such as lower task accuracy and higher token/time consumption; (II) LLMs exhibit varying robustness to scrambled input, making Typoglycemia a benchmark for model evaluation without new datasets; (III) Different task types have varying impacts, with complex logical tasks (e.g., math) being more challenging in scrambled form; (IV) Each LLM has a unique and consistent "cognitive pattern" across tasks, revealing general mechanisms in its psychology process. We provide an in-depth analysis of hidden layers to explain these phenomena, paving the way for future research in LLM Psychology and deeper interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Despite its popularity, individuals often report various information needs regarding buprenorphine treatment on social media platforms like Reddit. However, the key challenge is to characterize these needs. In this study, we propose a theme-based framework to curate and analyze large-scale data from social media to characterize self-reported treatment information needs (TINs). Methods: We collected 15,253 posts from r/Suboxone, one of the largest Reddit sub-community for buprenorphine products. Following the standard protocol, we first identified and defined five main themes from the data and then coded 6,000 posts based on these themes, where one post can be labeled with applicable one to three themes. Finally, we determined the most frequently appearing sub-themes (topics) for each theme by analyzing samples from each group. Results: Among the 6,000 posts, 40.3% contained a single theme, 36% two themes, and 13.9% three themes. The most frequent topics for each theme or theme combination came with several key findings - prevalent reporting of psychological and physical effects during recovery, complexities in accessing buprenorphine, and significant information gaps regarding medication administration, tapering, and usage of substances during different stages of recovery. Moreover, self-treatment strategies and peer-driven advice reveal valuable insights and potential misconceptions. Conclusions: The findings obtained using our proposed framework can inform better patient education and patient-provider communication, design systematic interventions to address treatment-related misconceptions and rumors, and streamline the generation of hypotheses for future research.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be a viable solution, leveraging external databases to improve the consistency and coherence of generated content, especially valuable for complex, knowledge-rich tasks, and facilitates continuous improvement by leveraging domain-specific insights. By combining the intrinsic knowledge of LLMs with the vast, dynamic repositories of external databases, RAG achieves a synergistic effect. However, RAG is not without its limitations, including a limited context window, irrelevant information, and the high processing overhead for extensive contextual data. In this comprehensive work, we explore the evolution of Contextual Compression paradigms, providing an in-depth examination of the field. Finally, we outline the current challenges and suggest potential research and development directions, paving the way for future advancements in this area.</p></details> | Ongoing Work |

One common use of LLMs is performing tasks on scientific topics, such as writing algorithms, querying databases or giving mathematical proofs. Inspired by the way university students are evaluated on such tasks, in this paper, we propose SciEx - a benchmark consisting of university computer science exam questions, to evaluate LLMs ability on solving scientific tasks. SciEx is (1) multilingual, containing both English and German exams, and (2) multi-modal, containing questions that involve images, and (3) contains various types of freeform questions with different difficulty levels, due to the nature of university exams. We evaluate the performance of various state-of-the-art LLMs on our new benchmark. Since SciEx questions are freeform, it is not straightforward to evaluate LLM performance. Therefore, we provide human expert grading of the LLM outputs on SciEx. We show that the free-form exams in SciEx remain challenging for the current LLMs, where the best LLM only achieves 59.4\% exam grade on average. We also provide detailed comparisons between LLM performance and student performance on SciEx. To enable future evaluation of new LLMs, we propose using LLM-as-a-judge to grade the LLM answers on SciEx. Our experiments show that, although they do not perform perfectly on solving the exams, LLMs are decent as graders, achieving 0.948 Pearson correlation with expert grading.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

These limitations stem from inadequate knowledge awareness of LLMs during vanilla fine-tuning. To address these problems, we propose a knowledge-aware fine-tuning (KnowTuning) method to improve fine-grained and coarse-grained knowledge awareness of LLMs. We devise a fine-grained knowledge augmentation stage to train LLMs to identify difficult fine-grained knowledge in answers. We also propose a coarse-grained knowledge comparison stage to train LLMs to distinguish between reliable and unreliable knowledge, in three aspects: completeness, factuality, and logicality. Extensive experiments on both generic and medical question answering (QA) datasets confirm the effectiveness of KnowTuning, through automatic and human evaluations, across various sizes of LLMs. We further verify that KnowTuning generates more facts with less factual error rate under fine-grained facts evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 main paper</p></details> |
| **[MedQA-CS: Benchmarking Large Language Models Clinical Skills Using an AI-SCE Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01553v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs) in healthcare require advanced clinical skills (CS), yet current benchmarks fail to evaluate these comprehensively. We introduce MedQA-CS, an AI-SCE framework inspired by medical education's Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs), to address this gap. MedQA-CS evaluates LLMs through two instruction-following tasks, LLM-as-medical-student and LLM-as-CS-examiner, designed to reflect real clinical scenarios. Our contributions include developing MedQA-CS, a comprehensive evaluation framework with publicly available data and expert annotations, and providing the quantitative and qualitative assessment of LLMs as reliable judges in CS evaluation. Our experiments show that MedQA-CS is a more challenging benchmark for evaluating clinical skills than traditional multiple-choice QA benchmarks (e.g., MedQA). Combined with existing benchmarks, MedQA-CS enables a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs' clinical capabilities for both open- and closed-source LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, they face challenges in managing their significant memory requirements. Although quantization-aware training (QAT) offers a solution by reducing memory consumption through low-bit representations with minimal accuracy loss, it is impractical due to substantial training resources. To address this, we propose Efficient Quantization-Aware Training (EfficientQAT), a more feasible QAT algorithm. EfficientQAT involves two consecutive phases: Block-wise training of all parameters (Block-AP) and end-to-end training of quantization parameters (E2E-QP). To the best of our knowledge, Block-AP is the first method to enable direct training of all parameters in a block-wise manner, reducing accuracy loss in low-bit scenarios by enhancing the solution space during optimization. E2E-QP then trains only the quantization parameters (step sizes) end-to-end, further improving the performance of quantized models by considering interactions among all sub-modules. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EfficientQAT outperforms previous quantization methods across a range of models, including base LLMs, instruction-tuned LLMs, and multimodal LLMs, with scales from 7B to 70B parameters at various quantization bits. For instance, EfficientQAT obtains a 2-bit Llama-2-70B model on a single A100-80GB GPU in 41 hours, with less than 3 points accuracy degradation compared to the full precision (69.48 vs. 72.41). Code is available at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/EfficientQAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ef...</summary><p>An efficient and effective quantization technical to improve the performance of low-bits LMMs and LVLMs</p></details> |

The resulting high-dimensional trajectories realize different contextualization, or 'thinking', steps, and fully determine the output probability distribution. We aim to characterize the statistical properties of ensembles of these 'lines of thought.' We observe that independent trajectories cluster along a low-dimensional, non-Euclidean manifold, and that their path can be well approximated by a stochastic equation with few parameters extracted from data. We find it remarkable that the vast complexity of such large models can be reduced to a much simpler form, and we reflect on implications.</p></details> |  |

A widely used method for achieving this alignment is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which, despite its success, faces challenges in accurately modelling human preferences. In this paper, we introduce GazeReward, a novel framework that integrates implicit feedback -- and specifically eye-tracking (ET) data -- into the Reward Model (RM). In addition, we explore how ET-based features can provide insights into user preferences. Through ablation studies we test our framework with different integration methods, LLMs, and ET generator models, demonstrating that our approach significantly improves the accuracy of the RM on established human preference datasets. This work advances the ongoing discussion on optimizing AI alignment with human values, exploring the potential of cognitive data for shaping future NLP research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Confidence Estimation via Black-Box Access](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04370v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating uncertainty or confidence in the responses of a model can be significant in evaluating trust not only in the responses, but also in the model as a whole. In this paper, we explore the problem of estimating confidence for responses of large language models (LLMs) with simply black-box or query access to them. We propose a simple and extensible framework where, we engineer novel features and train a (interpretable) model (viz. logistic regression) on these features to estimate the confidence. We empirically demonstrate that our simple framework is effective in estimating confidence of Flan-ul2, Llama-13b and Mistral-7b on four benchmark Q\&A tasks as well as of Pegasus-large and BART-large on two benchmark summarization tasks with it surpassing baselines by even over $10\%$ (on AUROC) in some cases. Additionally, our interpretable approach provides insight into features that are predictive of confidence, leading to the interesting and useful discovery that our confidence models built for one LLM generalize zero-shot across others on a given dataset.</p></details> |  |

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) address this challenge by fine-tuning a small subset of parameters. However, existing methods for fusing multiple LoRAs lack dynamic fusion based on contextual inputs and often increase inference time due to token-level operations. We propose DLP-LoRA, a Dynamic Lightweight Plugin that employs a mini-MLP module with only 5M parameters to dynamically fuse multiple LoRAs at the sentence level using top-p sampling strategies. This approach reduces inference time to less than twice that of single LoRA inference by leveraging parallel computation. Evaluations across 26 tasks-including multiple-choice questions and question answering-demonstrate that DLP-LoRA achieves an average accuracy of 92.34% on multiple-choice datasets and significant improvements in BLEU and ROUGE scores on QA datasets, outperforming different LLMs backbones under composite task settings. DLP-LoRA effectively balances performance and efficiency, making it a practical solution for dynamic multi-task adaptation in LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/MeCuping/DLP-LoRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint under review, 18 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

Traditional GNN methods focus on encoding the structural information of graphs, often using shallow text embeddings for node or edge attributes. This limits the model to understand the rich semantic information in the data and its reasoning ability for complex downstream tasks, while also lacking interpretability. With the rise of large language models (LLMs), an increasing number of studies are combining them with GNNs for graph representation learning and downstream tasks. While these approaches effectively leverage the rich semantic information in TAGs datasets, their main drawback is that they are only partially interpretable, which limits their application in critical fields. In this paper, we propose a verbalized graph representation learning (VGRL) method which is fully interpretable. In contrast to traditional graph machine learning models, which are usually optimized within a continuous parameter space, VGRL constrains this parameter space to be text description which ensures complete interpretability throughout the entire process, making it easier for users to understand and trust the decisions of the model. We conduct several studies to empirically evaluate the effectiveness of VGRL and we believe these method can serve as a stepping stone in graph representation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review. corresponding author: Zeyu Zhang</p></details> |

Previous melody-to-lyric research has been limited by scarce high-quality aligned data and unclear standard for creativeness. Most efforts focused on general themes or emotions, which are less valuable given current language model capabilities. In tonal contour languages like Mandarin, pitch contours are influenced by both melody and tone, leading to variations in lyric-melody fit. Our study, validated by the Mpop600 dataset, confirms that lyricists and melody writers consider this fit during their composition process. In this research, we developed a multi-agent system that decomposes the melody-to-lyric task into sub-tasks, with each agent controlling rhyme, syllable count, lyric-melody alignment, and consistency. Listening tests were conducted via a diffusion-based singing voice synthesizer to evaluate the quality of lyrics generated by different agent groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, figures, Accepted at O-COCOSDA 2024</p></details> |

For example, while synthetic captions often provide superior quality and image-text alignment, it is not clear whether they can fully replace AltTexts: the role of synthetic captions and their interaction with original web-crawled AltTexts in pre-training is still not well understood. Moreover, different multimodal foundation models may have unique preferences for specific caption formats, but efforts to identify the optimal captions for each model remain limited. In this work, we propose a novel, controllable, and scalable captioning pipeline designed to generate diverse caption formats tailored to various multimodal models. By examining Short Synthetic Captions (SSC) towards Dense Synthetic Captions (DSC+) as case studies, we systematically explore their effects and interactions with AltTexts across models such as CLIP, multimodal LLMs, and diffusion models. Our findings reveal that a hybrid approach that keeps both synthetic captions and AltTexts can outperform the use of synthetic captions alone, improving both alignment and performance, with each model demonstrating preferences for particular caption formats. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into optimizing captioning strategies, thereby advancing the pre-training of multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | CV/ML |

However, current transfer learning strategies devoted to full fine-tuning for transfer learning may require significant resources and yield sub-optimal results when the labeled data of the target task is scarce. This makes its applicability in real clinical settings challenging since these institutions are usually constrained on data and computational resources to develop proprietary solutions. To address this challenge, we formalize Few-Shot Efficient Fine-Tuning (FSEFT), a novel and realistic scenario for adapting medical image segmentation foundation models. This setting considers the key role of both data- and parameter- efficiency during adaptation. Building on a foundation model pre-trained on open-access CT organ segmentation sources, we propose leveraging Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning and black-box Adapters to address such challenges. Furthermore, novel efficient adaptation methodologies are introduced in this work, which include Spatial black-box Adapters that are more appropriate for dense prediction tasks and constrained transductive inference, leveraging task-specific prior knowledge. Our comprehensive transfer learning experiments confirm the suitability of foundation models in medical image segmentation and unveil the limitations of popular fine-tuning strategies in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Extension of MICCAI - MedAGI Workshop 2023.

Deep learning models have advanced ETS modeling by effectively capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, learning a generic representation of ETS data for various applications remains challenging due to the inherently complex hierarchical structure of ETS data. Moreover, ETS data exhibits intricate temporal dependencies and is suscepti ble to the influence of exogenous variables. Furthermore, different instances exhibit diverse electricity consumption behavior. In this paper, we propose a foundation model PowerPM to model ETS data, providing a large-scale, off-the-shelf model for power systems. PowerPM consists of a temporal encoder and a hierarchical encoder. The temporal encoder captures both temporal dependencies in ETS data, considering exogenous variables. The hierarchical encoder models the correlation between hierarchy. Furthermore, PowerPM leverages a novel self-supervised pretraining framework consisting of masked ETS modeling and dual-view contrastive learning, which enable PowerPM to capture temporal dependency within ETS windows and aware the discrepancy across ETS windows, providing two different perspectives to learn generic representation. Our experiments involve five real world scenario datasets, comprising private and public data. Through pre-training on massive ETS data, PowerPM achieves SOTA performance on diverse downstream tasks within the private dataset. Impressively, when transferred to the public datasets, PowerPM maintains its superiority, showcasing its remarkable generalization ability across various tasks and domains. Moreover, ablation studies, few-shot experiments provide additional evidence of the effectiveness of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

LOFF-TA involves training a compact classifier on cached feature embeddings from a frozen foundation model, resulting in up to $37\times$ faster training and up to $26\times$ reduced GPU memory usage. Because the embeddings of augmented images would be too numerous to store, yet the augmentation process is essential for training, we propose to apply tensor augmentations to the cached embeddings of the original non-augmented images. LOFF-TA makes it possible to leverage the power of foundation models, regardless of their size, in settings with limited computational capacity. Moreover, LOFF-TA can be used to apply foundation models to high-resolution images without increasing compute. In certain scenarios, we find that training with LOFF-TA yields better results than directly fine-tuning the foundation model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024)</p></details> |

However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</p></details> | EMNLP 2024 Findings |

However, it is challenging to apply the RL algorithms directly in the real world. For one thing, RL is data-intensive and typically requires millions of interactions with environments, which are impractical in real scenarios. For another, it is necessary to make heavy engineering efforts to design reward functions manually. To address these issues, we leverage foundation models in this paper. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Foundation Priors (RLFP) to utilize guidance and feedback from policy, value, and success-reward foundation models. Within this framework, we introduce the Foundation-guided Actor-Critic (FAC) algorithm, which enables embodied agents to explore more efficiently with automatic reward functions. The benefits of our framework are threefold: (1) \textit{sample efficient}; (2) \textit{minimal and effective reward engineering}; (3) \textit{agnostic to foundation model forms and robust to noisy priors}. Our method achieves remarkable performances in various manipulation tasks on both real robots and in simulation. Across 5 dexterous tasks with real robots, FAC achieves an average success rate of 86\% after one hour of real-time learning. Across 8 tasks in the simulated Meta-world, FAC achieves 100\% success rates in 7/8 tasks under less than 100k frames (about 1-hour training), outperforming baseline methods with manual-designed rewards in 1M frames. We believe the RLFP framework can enable future robots to explore and learn autonomously in the physical world for more tasks.</p></details> | CoRL 2024 (Oral) |

However, this problem is not only self-contradictory but likely unsolvable. Unfortunately, current control-based strategies for solving it inevitably embed dangerous representations of distrust. If superintelligence can't trust humanity, then we can't fully trust it to reliably follow safety controls it can likely bypass. Not only will intended permanent control fail to keep us safe, but it may even trigger the extinction event many fear. A logical rationale is therefore presented that advocates a strategic pivot from control-induced distrust to foundational AI alignment modeling instinct-based representations of familial mutual trust. With current AI already representing distrust of human intentions, the Supertrust meta-strategy is proposed to prevent long-term foundational misalignment and ensure superintelligence is instead driven by intrinsic trust-based patterns, leading to safe and protective coexistence.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging content-style decomposition within an information-theoretic framework, our method enhances the latent representations of pre-trained vision foundation models, aligning them more effectively with specific task objectives and addressing the problem of distribution shift. We evaluate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST, its augmented variations (with yellow and white stripes), CIFAR-10, SVHN, and GalaxyMNIST. The experiments show improvements over purely supervised baselines, particularly in low-labeled data regimes, across both frozen and trainable backbones for the majority of the tested datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lotus: Diffusion-based Visual Foundation Model for High-quality Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18124v2)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the visual priors of pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models offers a promising solution to enhance zero-shot generalization in dense prediction tasks. However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

The code of nature, hidden in diverse genomes since the very beginning of life's evolution, holds immense potential for impacting humans and ecosystems through genome modeling. Recent breakthroughs in GFMs, such as Evo, have attracted significant investment and attention to genomic modeling, as they address long-standing challenges and transform in-silico genomic studies into automated, reliable, and efficient paradigms. In the context of this flourishing era of consecutive technological revolutions in genomics, GFM studies face two major challenges: the lack of GFM benchmarking tools and the absence of open-source software for diverse genomics. These challenges hinder the rapid evolution of GFMs and their wide application in tasks such as understanding and synthesizing genomes, problems that have persisted for decades. To address these challenges, we introduce GFMBench, a framework dedicated to GFM-oriented benchmarking. GFMBench standardizes benchmark suites and automates benchmarking for a wide range of open-source GFMs. It integrates millions of genomic sequences across hundreds of genomic tasks from four large-scale benchmarks, democratizing GFMs for a wide range of in-silico genomic applications. Additionally, GFMBench is released as open-source software, offering user-friendly interfaces and diverse tutorials, applicable for AutoBench and complex tasks like RNA design and structure prediction. To facilitate further advancements in genome modeling, we have launched a public leaderboard showcasing the benchmark performance derived from AutoBench.

Advances in deep learning have enabled the development of state-of-the-art (SoTA) models for these tasks. However, model training is challenging due to data and label scarcity, especially in the less common imaging sequences. Moreover, each model is often trained for a specific task, with no connection between related tasks. In this work, we introduce a vision foundation model trained for CMR assessment, that is trained in a self-supervised fashion on 36 million CMR images. We then finetune the model in supervised way for 9 clinical tasks typical to a CMR workflow, across classification, segmentation, landmark localization, and pathology detection. We demonstrate improved accuracy and robustness across all tasks, over a range of available labeled dataset sizes. We also demonstrate improved few-shot learning with fewer labeled samples, a common challenge in medical image analyses. We achieve an out-of-box performance comparable to SoTA for most clinical tasks. The proposed method thus presents a resource-efficient, unified framework for CMR assessment, with the potential to accelerate the development of deep learning-based solutions for image analysis tasks, even with few annotated data available.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, with the reduction of imaging standards, the image quality has also been reduced, extremely limiting the clinical acceptability. Although numerous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of deep learning for the NICT enhancement in specific scenarios, their high data cost and limited generalizability have become large obstacles. The recent research on the foundation model has brought new opportunities for building a universal NICT enhancement model - bridging the image quality degradation with minimal data cost. However, owing to the challenges in the collection of large pre-training datasets and the compatibility of data variation, no success has been reported. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale integrated Transformer AMPlifier (TAMP), the first imaging foundation model for universal NICT enhancement. It has been pre-trained on a large-scale physical-driven simulation dataset with 3.6 million NICT-ICT image pairs, and is able to directly generalize to the NICT enhancement tasks with various non-ideal settings and body regions. Via the adaptation with few data, it can further achieve professional performance in real-world specific scenarios. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that the proposed TAMP has significant potential for promoting the exploration and application of NICT and serving a wider range of medical scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Current systems for spoken dialogue rely on pipelines of independent components, namely voice activity detection, speech recognition, textual dialogue and text-to-speech. Such frameworks cannot emulate the experience of real conversations. First, their complexity induces a latency of several seconds between interactions. Second, text being the intermediate modality for dialogue, non-linguistic information that modifies meaning -- such as emotion or non-speech sounds -- is lost in the interaction. Finally, they rely on a segmentation into speaker turns, which does not take into account overlapping speech, interruptions and interjections. Moshi solves these independent issues altogether by casting spoken dialogue as speech-to-speech generation. Starting from a text language model backbone, Moshi generates speech as tokens from the residual quantizer of a neural audio codec, while modeling separately its own speech and that of the user into parallel streams. This allows for the removal of explicit speaker turns, and the modeling of arbitrary conversational dynamics. We moreover extend the hierarchical semantic-to-acoustic token generation of previous work to first predict time-aligned text tokens as a prefix to audio tokens. Not only this "Inner Monologue" method significantly improves the linguistic quality of generated speech, but we also illustrate how it can provide streaming speech recognition and text-to-speech.

However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Guided Enhancement on Driving Perception System via Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01144v1)** | 2024-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models offer promising advancements for enhancing driving perception systems, but their high computational and financial costs pose challenges. We develop a method that leverages foundation models to refine predictions from existing driving perception models -- such as enhancing object classification accuracy -- while minimizing the frequency of using these resource-intensive models. The method quantitatively characterizes uncertainties in the perception model's predictions and engages the foundation model only when these uncertainties exceed a pre-specified threshold. Specifically, it characterizes uncertainty by calibrating the perception model's confidence scores into theoretical lower bounds on the probability of correct predictions using conformal prediction. Then, it sends images to the foundation model and queries for refining the predictions only if the theoretical bound of the perception model's outcome is below the threshold. Additionally, we propose a temporal inference mechanism that enhances prediction accuracy by integrating historical predictions, leading to tighter theoretical bounds. The method demonstrates a 10 to 15 percent improvement in prediction accuracy and reduces the number of queries to the foundation model by 50 percent, based on quantitative evaluations from driving datasets.</p></details> |  |

Feeding foundation models a regionally diverse food dataset of World Wide Dishes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09496v2)** | 2024-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives, used in everyday tasks such as text-image searches, interactions with chatbots, and content generation. As use increases, so does concern over the disparities in performance and fairness of these models for different people in different parts of the world. To assess these growing regional disparities, we present World Wide Dishes, a mixed text and image dataset consisting of 765 dishes, with dish names collected in 131 local languages. World Wide Dishes has been collected purely through human contribution and decentralised means, by creating a website widely distributed through social networks. Using the dataset, we demonstrate a novel means of operationalising capability and representational biases in foundation models such as language models and text-to-image generative models. We enrich these studies with a pilot community review to understand, from a first-person perspective, how these models generate images for people in five African countries and the United States. We find that these models generally do not produce quality text and image outputs of dishes specific to different regions. This is true even for the US, which is typically considered to be more well-resourced in training data - though the generation of US dishes does outperform that of the investigated African countries. The models demonstrate a propensity to produce outputs that are inaccurate as well as culturally misrepresentative, flattening, and insensitive. These failures in capability and representational bias have the potential to further reinforce stereotypes and disproportionately contribute to erasure based on region. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/oxai/world-wide-dishes/.</p></details> |  |

However, existing speech FMs (SFMs) fall short of full compliance with the open-source principles, even if claimed otherwise, as no existing SFM has model weights, code, and training data publicly available under open-source terms. In this work, we take the first step toward filling this gap by focusing on the 24 official languages of the European Union (EU). We collect suitable training data by surveying automatic speech recognition datasets and unlabeled speech corpora under open-source compliant licenses, for a total of 950k hours. Additionally, we release automatic transcripts for 441k hours of unlabeled data under the permissive CC-BY license, thereby facilitating the creation of open-source SFMs for the EU languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

Industry and research community have witnessed a large number of new applications, based on those foundation models. Such applications include question and answer, customer services, image and video generation, and code completions, among others. However, as the number of model parameters reaches to hundreds of billions, their deployment incurs prohibitive inference costs and high latency in real-world scenarios.

Drawing inspiration from advances in language modeling, RisingBALLER treats each football match as a unique sequence in which players serve as tokens, with their embeddings shaped by the specific context of the match. Through the use of masked player prediction (MPP) as a pre-training task, RisingBALLER learns foundational features for football player representations, similar to how language models learn semantic features for text representations. As a downstream task, I introduce next match statistics prediction (NMSP) to showcase the effectiveness of the learned player embeddings. The NMSP model surpasses a strong baseline commonly used for performance forecasting within the community. Furthermore, I conduct an in-depth analysis to demonstrate how the learned embeddings by RisingBALLER can be used in various football analytics tasks, such as producing meaningful positional features that capture the essence and variety of player roles beyond rigid x,y coordinates, team cohesion estimation, and similar player retrieval for more effective data-driven scouting. More than a simple machine learning model, RisingBALLER is a comprehensive framework designed to transform football data analytics by learning high-level foundational features for players, taking into account the context of each match. It offers a deeper understanding of football players beyond individual statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 figures.

However, as a community, we have been constraining most robotic systems by designing them for specific tasks, training them on specific datasets, and deploying them within specific environments. These systems require extensively-labeled data and task-specific models. When deployed in real-world scenarios, such systems face several generalization issues and struggle to remain robust to distribution shifts. Motivated by the impressive open-set performance and content generation capabilities of web-scale, large-capacity pre-trained models (i.e., foundation models) in research fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV), we devote this survey to exploring (i) how these existing foundation models from NLP and CV can be applied to the field of general-purpose robotics, and also exploring (ii) what a robotics-specific foundation model would look like. We begin by providing a generalized formulation of how foundation models are used in robotics, and the fundamental barriers to making generalist robots universally applicable. Next, we establish a taxonomy to discuss current work exploring ways to leverage existing foundation models for robotics and develop ones catered to robotics. Finally, we discuss key challenges and promising future directions in using foundation models for enabling general-purpose robotic systems. We encourage readers to view our living GitHub repository 2 of resources, including papers reviewed in this survey, as well as related projects and repositories for developing foundation models for robotics.</p></details> |  |

Fine-tuning (FT) is a method of customizing a pre-trained AI foundation model by further training it on a smaller, targeted dataset. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Privacy-Preserving Parameter-Efficient FT (P3EFT) framework, which can be viewed as the intersection of Parameter-Efficient FT (PEFT) and Privacy-Preserving FT (PPFT). PEFT modifies only a small subset of the model's parameters to achieve FT (i.e., adapting a pre-trained model to a specific dataset), while PPFT uses privacy-preserving technologies to protect the confidentiality of the model during the FT process. There have been many studies on PEFT or PPFT but very few on their fusion, which motivates our work on P3EFT to achieve both parameter efficiency and model privacy. To exemplify our P3EFT, we present the PrivTuner scheme, which incorporates Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enabled privacy protection into LoRA (short for ``Low-Rank Adapter''). Intuitively speaking, PrivTuner allows the model owner and the external data owners to collaboratively implement PEFT with encrypted data. After describing PrivTuner in detail, we further investigate its energy consumption and privacy protection. Then, we consider a PrivTuner system over wireless communications and formulate a joint optimization problem to adaptively minimize energy while maximizing privacy protection, with the optimization variables including FDMA bandwidth allocation, wireless transmission power, computational resource allocation, and privacy protection. A resource allocation algorithm is devised to solve the problem. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm can significantly reduce energy consumption while adapting to different privacy requirements.</p></details> |  |

Existing CLQA methods that learn parameters bound to certain entity or relation vocabularies can only be applied to the graph they are trained on which requires substantial training time before being deployed on a new graph. Here we present UltraQuery, the first foundation model for inductive reasoning that can zero-shot answer logical queries on any KG. The core idea of UltraQuery is to derive both projections and logical operations as vocabulary-independent functions which generalize to new entities and relations in any KG. With the projection operation initialized from a pre-trained inductive KG reasoning model, UltraQuery can solve CLQA on any KG after finetuning on a single dataset. Experimenting on 23 datasets, UltraQuery in the zero-shot inference mode shows competitive or better query answering performance than best available baselines and sets a new state of the art on 15 of them.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Comprehensive Performance Modeling and System Design Insights for Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00273v1)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI, in particular large transformer models, are increasingly driving HPC system design in science and industry. We analyze performance characteristics of such transformer models and discuss their sensitivity to the transformer type, parallelization strategy, and HPC system features (accelerators and interconnects). We utilize a performance model that allows us to explore this complex design space and highlight its key components. We find that different transformer types demand different parallelism and system characteristics at different training regimes. Large Language Models are performant with 3D parallelism and amplify network needs only at pre-training scales with reduced dependence on accelerator capacity and bandwidth. On the other hand, long-sequence transformers, representative of scientific foundation models, place a more uniform dependence on network and capacity with necessary 4D parallelism. Our analysis emphasizes the need for closer performance modeling of different transformer types keeping system features in mind and demonstrates a path towards this. Our code is available as open-source.</p></details> | 17 pages, PMBS 2024 |
| **[FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fast simulation of dynamical systems is a key challenge in many scientific and engineering applications, such as weather forecasting, disease control, and drug discovery. With the recent success of deep learning, there is increasing interest in using neural networks to solve differential equations in a data-driven manner. However, existing methods are either limited to specific types of differential equations or require large amounts of data for training. This restricts their practicality in many real-world applications, where data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal foundation model, named \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), to bridge the gap between human-designed and data-driven models for the fast simulation of dynamical systems. Built on a decoder-only transformer architecture with in-context learning, FMint utilizes both numerical and textual data to learn a universal error correction scheme for dynamical systems, using prompted sequences of coarse solutions from traditional solvers. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 40K ODEs, and we perform extensive experiments on challenging ODEs that exhibit chaotic behavior and of high dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared to classical numerical solvers, highlighting FMint's potential as a general-purpose solver for dynamical systems. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms. The code for FMint is available at \url{https://github.com/margotyjx/FMint}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paving the way toward foundation models for irregular and unaligned Satellite Image Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08448v2)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recently several foundation models for satellite remote sensing imagery have been proposed, they fail to address major challenges of real/operational applications. Indeed, embeddings that don't take into account the spectral, spatial and temporal dimensions of the data as well as the irregular or unaligned temporal sampling are of little use for most real world uses. As a consequence, we propose an ALIgned Sits Encoder (ALISE), a novel approach that leverages the spatial, spectral, and temporal dimensions of irregular and unaligned SITS while producing aligned latent representations. Unlike SSL models currently available for SITS, ALISE incorporates a flexible query mechanism to project the SITS into a common and learned temporal projection space. Additionally, thanks to a multi-view framework, we explore integration of instance discrimination along a masked autoencoding task to SITS. The quality of the produced representation is assessed through three downstream tasks: crop segmentation (PASTIS), land cover segmentation (MultiSenGE), and a novel crop change detection dataset. Furthermore, the change detection task is performed without supervision. The results suggest that the use of aligned representations is more effective than previous SSL methods for linear probing segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-FFM: Towards LM-Empowered Federated Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14252v3)** | 2024-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike natural language processing and computer vision, the development of Foundation Models (FMs) for time series forecasting is blocked due to data scarcity. While recent efforts are focused on building such FMs by unlocking the potential of language models (LMs) for time series analysis, dedicated parameters for various downstream forecasting tasks need training, which hinders the common knowledge sharing across domains. Moreover, data owners may hesitate to share the access to local data due to privacy concerns and copyright protection, which makes it impossible to simply construct a FM on cross-domain training instances. To address these issues, we propose Time-FFM, a Federated Foundation Model for Time series forecasting by leveraging pretrained LMs. Specifically, we begin by transforming time series into the modality of text tokens. To bootstrap LMs for time series reasoning, we propose a prompt adaption module to determine domain-customized prompts dynamically instead of artificially. Given the data heterogeneity across domains, we design a personalized federated training strategy by learning global encoders and local prediction heads. Our comprehensive experiments indicate that Time-FFM outperforms state-of-the-arts and promises effective few-shot and zero-shot forecaster.</p></details> |  |
| **[OBSeg: Accurate and Fast Instance Segmentation Framework Using Segmentation Foundation Models with Oriented Bounding Box Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08174v6)** | 2024-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instance segmentation in remote sensing images is a long-standing challenge. Since horizontal bounding boxes introduce many interference objects, oriented bounding boxes (OBBs) are usually used for instance identification. However, based on ``segmentation within bounding box'' paradigm, current instance segmentation methods using OBBs are overly dependent on bounding box detection performance. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes OBSeg, an accurate and fast instance segmentation framework using OBBs. OBSeg is based on box prompt-based segmentation foundation models (BSMs), e.g., Segment Anything Model. Specifically, OBSeg first detects OBBs to distinguish instances and provide coarse localization information. Then, it predicts OBB prompt-related masks for fine segmentation. Since OBBs only serve as prompts, OBSeg alleviates the over-dependence on bounding box detection performance of current instance segmentation methods using OBBs. Thanks to OBB prompts, OBSeg outperforms other current BSM-based methods using HBBs. In addition, to enable BSMs to handle OBB prompts, we propose a novel OBB prompt encoder. To make OBSeg more lightweight and further improve the performance of lightweight distilled BSMs, a Gaussian smoothing-based knowledge distillation method is introduced. Experiments demonstrate that OBSeg outperforms current instance segmentation methods on multiple datasets in terms of instance segmentation accuracy and has competitive inference speed. The code is available at https://github.com/zhen6618/OBBInstanceSegmentation.</p></details> |  |

Typically, federated learning of vision-language models employs prompt learning to reduce communication and computational costs, i.e., prompt-based federated learning. However, there is limited theoretical analysis to understand the performance of prompt-based federated learning. In this work, we construct a theoretical analysis framework for prompt-based federated learning via feature learning theory. Specifically, we monitor the evolution of signal learning and noise memorization in prompt-based federated learning, demonstrating that performance can be assessed by the ratio of task-relevant to task-irrelevant coefficients. Furthermore, we draw an analogy between income and risk in portfolio optimization and the task-relevant and task-irrelevant terms in feature learning. Leveraging inspiration from portfolio optimization that combining two independent assets will maintain the income while reducing the risk, we introduce two prompts: global prompt and local prompt to construct a prompt portfolio to balance the generalization and personalization. Consequently, we showed the performance advantage of the prompt portfolio and derived the optimal mixing coefficient. These theoretical claims have been further supported by empirical experiments.</p></details> |  |

These theoretically-derived dimensions aim to provide a comprehensive profile of an individual's moral concerns which, in recent work, has been linked to behaviour in a range of domains, including society, politics, health, and the environment. In this paper, we investigate how moral foundation dimensions can contribute to predicting an individual's stance on a given target. Specifically we incorporate moral foundation features extracted from text, along with message semantic features, to classify stances at both message- and user-levels using both traditional machine learning models and large language models. Our preliminary results suggest that encoding moral foundations can enhance the performance of stance detection tasks and help illuminate the associations between specific moral foundations and online stances on target topics. The results highlight the importance of considering deeper psychological attributes in stance analysis and underscores the role of moral foundations in guiding online social behavior.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

However, variations in organs, tissue preparation methods, and image acquisition processes can lead to domain discrepancies among digital pathology images. To address this problem, in this paper, we use Rein, a fine-tuning method, to parametrically and efficiently fine-tune various vision foundation models (VFMs) for MICCAI 2024 Cross-Organ and Cross-Scanner Adenocarcinoma Segmentation (COSAS2024). The core of Rein consists of a set of learnable tokens, which are directly linked to instances, improving functionality at the instance level in each layer. In the data environment of the COSAS2024 Challenge, extensive experiments demonstrate that Rein fine-tuned the VFMs to achieve satisfactory results. Specifically, we used Rein to fine-tune ConvNeXt and DINOv2. Our team used the former to achieve scores of 0.7719 and 0.7557 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task1, respectively, while the latter achieved scores of 0.8848 and 0.8192 on the preliminary test phase and final test phase in task2.

However, despite their strong generalization capabilities, medical foundation models pre-trained on large-scale datasets tend to suffer from domain gaps between heterogeneous data, leading to suboptimal performance on specific tasks compared to specialist models, as evidenced by previous studies. In this paper, we explore a new perspective called "Knowledge Decomposition" to improve the performance on specific medical tasks, which deconstructs the foundation model into multiple lightweight expert models, each dedicated to a particular anatomical region, with the aim of enhancing specialization and simultaneously reducing resource consumption. To accomplish the above objective, we propose a novel framework named Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition (LoRKD), which explicitly separates gradients from different tasks by incorporating low-rank expert modules and efficient knowledge separation convolution. The low-rank expert modules resolve gradient conflicts between heterogeneous data from different anatomical regions, providing strong specialization at lower costs. The efficient knowledge separation convolution significantly improves algorithm efficiency by achieving knowledge separation within a single forward propagation. Extensive experimental results on segmentation and classification tasks demonstrate that our decomposed models not only achieve state-of-the-art performance but also exhibit superior transferability on downstream tasks, even surpassing the original foundation models in task-specific evaluations.

Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly speech foundation models, have shown significant promise in detecting mental health states by capturing diverse features. This study investigates which pretext tasks in these models best transfer to mental health detection and examines how different model layers encode features relevant to mental health conditions. We also probed the optimal length of audio segments and the best pooling strategies to improve detection accuracy.

| **[Lens: A Foundation Model for Network Traffic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03646v4)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic refers to the amount of data being sent and received over the internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic is challenging due to the diverse nature of data packets, which often feature heterogeneous headers and encrypted payloads lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods typically excel in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundation model for network traffic that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from raw data. To further enhance pre-training effectiveness, we design a novel loss that combines three distinct tasks: Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and generation. Notably, it also requires much less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing the energy consumption in continual training of vision foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18664v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the ever-growing adoption of AI, its impact on the environment is no longer negligible. Despite the potential that continual learning could have towards Green AI, its environmental sustainability remains relatively uncharted. In this work we aim to gain a systematic understanding of the energy efficiency of continual learning algorithms. To that end, we conducted an extensive set of empirical experiments comparing the energy consumption of recent representation-, prompt-, and exemplar-based continual learning algorithms and two standard baseline (fine tuning and joint training) when used to continually adapt a pre-trained ViT-B/16 foundation model. We performed our experiments on three standard datasets: CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and DomainNet. Additionally, we propose a novel metric, the Energy NetScore, which we use measure the algorithm efficiency in terms of energy-accuracy trade-off. Through numerous evaluations varying the number and size of the incremental learning steps, our experiments demonstrate that different types of continual learning algorithms have very different impacts on energy consumption during both training and inference. Although often overlooked in the continual learning literature, we found that the energy consumed during the inference phase is crucial for evaluating the environmental sustainability of continual learning models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted at the Green FOundation MOdels (GreenFOMO) ECCV 2024 Workshop</p></details> |

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks. Code, data and model will be soon available at GitHub.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models, based on self-supervised learning, address these issues and improve data efficiency. Natural domain foundation models show promise for medical imaging, but systematic research evaluating domain adaptation, especially using self-supervised learning and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, remains underexplored. Additionally, little research addresses the issue of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning of foundation models. We adapted the DINOv2 vision transformer for retinal imaging classification tasks using self-supervised learning and generated two novel foundation models termed DINORET and BE DINORET. Publicly available color fundus photographs were employed for model development and subsequent fine-tuning for diabetic retinopathy staging and glaucoma detection. We introduced block expansion as a novel domain adaptation strategy and assessed the models for catastrophic forgetting. Models were benchmarked to RETFound, a state-of-the-art foundation model in ophthalmology. DINORET and BE DINORET demonstrated competitive performance on retinal imaging tasks, with the block expanded model achieving the highest scores on most datasets. Block expansion successfully mitigated catastrophic forgetting. Our few-shot learning studies indicated that DINORET and BE DINORET outperform RETFound in terms of data-efficiency. This study highlights the potential of adapting natural domain vision models to retinal imaging using self-supervised learning and block expansion. BE DINORET offers robust performance without sacrificing previously acquired capabilities. Our findings suggest that these methods could enable healthcare institutions to develop tailored vision models for their patient populations, enhancing global healthcare inclusivity.</p></details> | <details><summary>J.Zoe...</summary><p>J.Zoellin, C.

| **[Unveiling Ontological Commitment in Multi-Modal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17109v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ontological commitment, i.e., used concepts, relations, and assumptions, are a corner stone of qualitative reasoning (QR) models. The state-of-the-art for processing raw inputs, though, are deep neural networks (DNNs), nowadays often based off from multimodal foundation models. These automatically learn rich representations of concepts and respective reasoning. Unfortunately, the learned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection, validation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possible to associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, but extractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next step towards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose a method that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN for a given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf concept embeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchical clustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector distances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in available ontologies from QR. An initial evaluation study shows that meaningful ontological class hierarchies can be extracted from state-of-the-art foundation models. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to validate and verify a DNN's learned representations against given ontologies. Lastly, we discuss potential future applications in the context of QR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Quali...</summary><p>Qualitative Reasoning Workshop 2024 (QR2024) colocated with ECAI2024, camera-ready submission; first two authors contributed equally; 10 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

What Matters and What Does Not](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17044v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable performance achieved by Large Language Models (LLM) has driven research efforts to leverage them for a wide range of tasks and input modalities. In speech-to-text (S2T) tasks, the emerging solution consists of projecting the output of the encoder of a Speech Foundational Model (SFM) into the LLM embedding space through an adapter module. However, no work has yet investigated how much the downstream-task performance depends on each component (SFM, adapter, LLM) nor whether the best design of the adapter depends on the chosen SFM and LLM. To fill this gap, we evaluate the combination of 5 adapter modules, 2 LLMs (Mistral and Llama), and 2 SFMs (Whisper and SeamlessM4T) on two widespread S2T tasks, namely Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech Translation. Our results demonstrate that the SFM plays a pivotal role in downstream performance, while the adapter choice has moderate impact and depends on the SFM and LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Scene Change Detection Using Visual Foundation Models and Cross-Attention Mechanisms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16850v1)** | 2024-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel method for scene change detection that leverages the robust feature extraction capabilities of a visual foundational model, DINOv2, and integrates full-image cross-attention to address key challenges such as varying lighting, seasonal variations, and viewpoint differences. In order to effectively learn correspondences and mis-correspondences between an image pair for the change detection task, we propose to a) ``freeze'' the backbone in order to retain the generality of dense foundation features, and b) employ ``full-image'' cross-attention to better tackle the viewpoint variations between the image pair. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, VL-CMU-CD and PSCD, along with their viewpoint-varied versions. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score, particularly in scenarios involving geometric changes between image pairs. The results indicate our method's superior generalization capabilities over existing state-of-the-art approaches, showing robustness against photometric and geometric variations as well as better overall generalization when fine-tuned to adapt to new environments. Detailed ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component in our architecture. Source code will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Our approach leverages a state-of-the-art Vision Foundation Model (VFM) within an encoder-decoder architecture, incorporating cross-attention mechanisms to enhance feature integration. This design captures detailed global representations and preserves essential spectral characteristics, treating RGB-to-NIR translation as more than a simple domain transfer problem. A multi-scale PatchGAN discriminator ensures realistic image generation at various detail levels, while carefully designed loss functions couple global context understanding with local feature preservation. We performed experiments on the RANUS dataset to demonstrate Pix2Next's advantages in quantitative metrics and visual quality, improving the FID score by 34.81% compared to existing methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the practical utility of Pix2Next by showing improved performance on a downstream object detection task using generated NIR data to augment limited real NIR datasets. The proposed approach enables the scaling up of NIR datasets without additional data acquisition or annotation efforts, potentially accelerating advancements in NIR-based computer vision applications.</p></details> | 19 pages,12 figures |

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are often limited by available transcribed speech data and benefit from a second pass rescoring using LLM. Recently multi-modal large language models, particularly speech and text foundational models have demonstrated strong spoken language understanding. Speech-Text foundational models leverage large amounts of unlabelled and labelled data both in speech and text modalities to model human language. In this work, we propose novel techniques to use multi-modal LLM for ASR rescoring. We also explore discriminative training to further improve the foundational model rescoring performance. We demonstrate cross-modal knowledge transfer in speech-text LLM can benefit rescoring. Our experiments demonstrate up-to 20% relative improvements over Whisper large ASR and up-to 15% relative improvements over text-only LLM.</p></details> |  |

We used ECG-Image-Kit, an open-source Python toolkit, to generate realistic images of 12-lead ECG printouts from raw ECG time-series. The images include realistic distortions such as noise, wrinkles, stains, and perspective shifts, generated both digitally and physically. The toolkit was applied to 977 12-lead ECG records from the PTB-XL database and 1,000 from Emory Healthcare to create high-fidelity synthetic ECG images. These unique images were subjected to both programmatic distortions using ECG-Image-Kit and physical effects like soaking, staining, and mold growth, followed by scanning and photography under various lighting conditions to create real-world artifacts. The resulting dataset includes 35,595 software-labeled ECG images with a wide range of imaging artifacts and distortions. The dataset provides ground truth time-series data alongside the images, offering a reference for developing machine and deep learning models for ECG digitization and classification. The images vary in quality, from clear scans of clean papers to noisy photographs of degraded papers, enabling the development of more generalizable digitization algorithms. ECG-Image-Database addresses a critical need for digitizing paper-based and non-digital ECGs for computerized analysis, providing a foundation for developing robust machine and deep learning models capable of converting ECG images into time-series. The dataset aims to serve as a reference for ECG digitization and computerized annotation efforts. ECG-Image-Database was used in the PhysioNet Challenge 2024 on ECG image digitization and classification.</p></details> |  |

By directly operating on complex-valued short-time Fourier transform coefficients, our model does not rely on any vocoders for time-domain signal reconstruction. As a result, our model simplifies the synthesis process and removes the quality upper-bound introduced by any mel-spectrogram vocoder compared to prior work SpeechFlow. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple speech restoration tasks, including speech denoising, bandwidth extension, codec artifact removal, and target speaker extraction. In all scenarios, finetuning our pretrained model results in superior performance over strong baselines. Notably, in the target speaker extraction task, our model outperforms existing systems, including those leveraging SSL-pretrained encoders like WavLM.

| **[Expert-level vision-language foundation model for real-world radiology and comprehensive evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16183v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiology is a vital and complex component of modern clinical workflow and covers many tasks. Recently, vision-language (VL) foundation models in medicine have shown potential in processing multimodal information, offering a unified solution for various radiology tasks. However, existing studies either pre-trained VL models on natural data or did not fully integrate vision-language architecture and pretraining, often neglecting the unique multimodal complexity in radiology images and their textual contexts. Additionally, their practical applicability in real-world scenarios remains underexplored. Here, we present RadFound, a large and open-source vision-language foundation model tailored for radiology, that is trained on the most extensive dataset of over 8.1 million images and 250,000 image-text pairs, covering 19 major organ systems and 10 imaging modalities. To establish expert-level multimodal perception and generation capabilities, RadFound introduces an enhanced vision encoder to capture intra-image local features and inter-image contextual information, and a unified cross-modal learning design tailored to radiology. To fully assess the models' capability, we construct a benchmark, RadVLBench, including radiology interpretation tasks like medical vision-language question-answering, as well as text generation tasks ranging from captioning to report generation. We also propose a human evaluation framework. When evaluated on the real-world benchmark involving three representative modalities, 2D images (chest X-rays), multi-view images (mammograms), and 3D images (thyroid CT scans), RadFound significantly outperforms other VL foundation models on both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. In summary, the development of RadFound represents an advancement in radiology generalists, demonstrating broad applicability potential for integration into clinical workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Robust Automation of Surgical Systems via Digital Twin-based Scene Representations from Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13107v2)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-based (LLM) agents are emerging as a powerful enabler of robust embodied intelligence due to their capability of planning complex action sequences. Sound planning ability is necessary for robust automation in many task domains, but especially in surgical automation. These agents rely on a highly detailed natural language representation of the scene. Thus, to leverage the emergent capabilities of LLM agents for surgical task planning, developing similarly powerful and robust perception algorithms is necessary to derive a detailed scene representation of the environment from visual input. Previous research has focused primarily on enabling LLM-based task planning while adopting simple yet severely limited perception solutions to meet the needs for bench-top experiments but lack the critical flexibility to scale to less constrained settings. In this work, we propose an alternate perception approach -- a digital twin-based machine perception approach that capitalizes on the convincing performance and out-of-the-box generalization of recent vision foundation models. Integrating our digital twin-based scene representation and LLM agent for planning with the dVRK platform, we develop an embodied intelligence system and evaluate its robustness in performing peg transfer and gauze retrieval tasks. Our approach shows strong task performance and generalizability to varied environment settings. Despite convincing performance, this work is merely a first step towards the integration of digital twin-based scene representations. Future studies are necessary for the realization of a comprehensive digital twin framework to improve the interpretability and generalizability of embodied intelligence in surgery.</p></details> |  |

However, there has been limited work on integrating an additional, typically low-resource, language, while maintaining performance on the original language set. Fine-tuning, while simple, may degrade the accuracy of the original set. We compare three approaches that exploit adaptation parameters: soft language code tuning, train only the language code; soft prompt tuning, train prepended tokens; and LoRA where a small set of additional parameters are optimised. Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) offers an alternative compromise with the potential to maintain performance in specific target languages. Results show that direct fine-tuning yields the best performance for the new language but degrades existing language capabilities. EWC can address this issue for specific languages. If only adaptation parameters are used, the language capabilities are maintained but at the cost of performance in the new language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of Interspeech</p></details> |

In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards Universal Large-Scale Foundational Model for Natural Gas Demand Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15794v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of global energy strategy, accurate natural gas demand forecasting is crucial for ensuring efficient resource allocation and operational planning. Traditional forecasting methods struggle to cope with the growing complexity and variability of gas consumption patterns across diverse industries and commercial sectors. To address these challenges, we propose the first foundation model specifically tailored for natural gas demand forecasting. Foundation models, known for their ability to generalize across tasks and datasets, offer a robust solution to the limitations of traditional methods, such as the need for separate models for different customer segments and their limited generalization capabilities. Our approach leverages contrastive learning to improve prediction accuracy in real-world scenarios, particularly by tackling issues such as noise in historical consumption data and the potential misclassification of similar data samples, which can lead to degradation in the quaility of the representation and thus the accuracy of downstream forecasting tasks. By integrating advanced noise filtering techniques within the contrastive learning framework, our model enhances the quality of learned representations, leading to more accurate predictions. Furthermore, the model undergoes industry-specific fine-tuning during pretraining, enabling it to better capture the unique characteristics of gas consumption across various sectors. We conducted extensive experiments using a large-scale dataset from ENN Group, which includes data from over 10,000 industrial, commercial, and welfare-related customers across multiple regions. Our model outperformed existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating a relative improvement in MSE by 3.68\% and in MASE by 6.15\% compared to the best available model.</p></details> |  |
| **[dnaGrinder: a lightweight and high-capacity genomic foundation model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15697v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of understanding and interpreting the complex information encoded within genomic sequences remains a grand challenge in biological research and clinical applications. In this context, recent advancements in large language model research have led to the development of both encoder-only and decoder-only foundation models designed to decode intricate information in DNA sequences. However, several issues persist, particularly regarding the efficient management of long-range dependencies inherent in genomic sequences, the effective representation of nucleotide variations, and the considerable computational costs associated with large model architectures and extensive pretraining datasets. Current genomic foundation models often face a critical tradeoff: smaller models with mediocre performance versus large models with improved performance. To address these challenges, we introduce dnaGrinder, a unique and efficient genomic foundation model. dnaGrinder excels at managing long-range dependencies within genomic sequences while minimizing computational costs without compromising performance. It achieves results that are not just comparable but often superior to leading DNA models such as Nucleotide Transformer and DNABERT-2. Furthermore, dnaGrinder is designed for easy fine-tuning on workstation-grade GPUs, accommodating input lengths exceeding 17,000 tokens. On a single high-performance GPU, it supports sequences longer than 140,000 tokens, making it a highly efficient and accessible tool for both basic biological research and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVLA: Reverting Visual Domain Limitation of Robotic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15250v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models and access to large-scale robotic datasets has sparked a paradigm shift in robotics models transforming them into generalists able to adapt to various tasks, scenes, and robot modalities. A large step for the community are open Vision Language Action models which showcase strong performance in a wide variety of tasks. In this work, we study the visual generalization capabilities of three existing robotic foundation models, and propose a corresponding evaluation framework. Our study shows that the existing models do not exhibit robustness to visual out-of-domain scenarios. This is potentially caused by limited variations in the training data and/or catastrophic forgetting, leading to domain limitations in the vision foundation models. We further explore OpenVLA, which uses two pre-trained vision foundation models and is, therefore, expected to generalize to out-of-domain experiments. However, we showcase catastrophic forgetting by DINO-v2 in OpenVLA through its failure to fulfill the task of depth regression. To overcome the aforementioned issue of visual catastrophic forgetting, we propose a gradual backbone reversal approach founded on model merging. This enables OpenVLA which requires the adaptation of the visual backbones during initial training -- to regain its visual generalization ability. Regaining this capability enables our ReVLA model to improve over OpenVLA by a factor of 77% and 66% for grasping and lifting in visual OOD tasks .</p></details> |  |

Foundation models, pre-trained models that can be adapted to downstream tasks with small datasets, could alleviate this problem. Researchers at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) proposed RETFound-MEH, a retinal foundation model trained on 900,000 images, including private hospital data. Recently, data-efficient DERETFound was proposed providing comparable performance while being trained on only 150,000 publicly available images. However, both these models required very substantial resources to train initially and are resource-intensive in downstream use. We propose a novel Token Reconstruction objective that we use to train RETFound-Green, a retinal foundation model trained using only 75,000 publicly available images and 400 times less compute. We estimate the cost of training RETFound-MEH and DERETFound at \$10,000 and \$14,000, respectively. RETFound-Green could be trained for less than \$100, with equally reduced environmental impact. RETFound-Green is also far more efficient in downstream use: it can be downloaded 14 times faster, computes vector embeddings 2.7 times faster which then require 2.6 times less storage space. Despite this, RETFound-Green does not perform systematically worse. In fact, on various task on three downstream datasets from Brazil, India and China, it performs best on 68 tasks out of 119 comparisons, versus 21 for DERETFound and 13 for RETFound-MEH. Our results suggest that RETFound-Green is a very efficient, high-performance retinal foundation model. We anticipate that our Token Reconstruction objective could be scaled up for even higher performance and be applied to other domains beyond retinal imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-Free Multi-domain Graph Pre-training: Toward Graph Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13934v4)** | 2024-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the ubiquity of graph data, it is intriguing to ask: Is it possible to train a graph foundation model on a broad range of graph data across diverse domains? A major hurdle toward this goal lies in the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit profoundly divergent characteristics. Although there have been some initial efforts in integrating multi-domain graphs for pre-training, they primarily rely on textual descriptions to align the graphs, limiting their application to text-attributed graphs. Moreover, different source domains may conflict or interfere with each other, and their relevance to the target domain can vary significantly. To address these issues, we propose MDGPT, a text free Multi-Domain Graph Pre-Training and adaptation framework designed to exploit multi-domain knowledge for graph learning. First, we propose a set of domain tokens to to align features across source domains for synergistic pre-training. Second, we propose a dual prompts, consisting of a unifying prompt and a mixing prompt, to further adapt the target domain with unified multi-domain knowledge and a tailored mixture of domain-specific knowledge. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments involving six public datasets to evaluate and analyze MDGPT, which outperforms prior art by up to 37.9%.</p></details> | Under review |

We hypothesize that MFMs, with their joint pre-training across multiple modalities, will be more effective in non-verbal sounds emotion recognition (NVER) by better interpreting and differentiating subtle emotional cues that may be ambiguous in audio-only foundation models (AFMs). To validate our hypothesis, we extract representations from state-of-the-art (SOTA) MFMs and AFMs and evaluated them on benchmark NVER datasets. We also investigate the potential of combining selected foundation model representations to enhance NVER further inspired by research in speech recognition and audio deepfake detection. To achieve this, we propose a framework called MATA (Intra-Modality Alignment through Transport Attention). Through MATA coupled with the combination of MFMs: LanguageBind and ImageBind, we report the topmost performance with accuracies of 76.47%, 77.40%, 75.12% and F1-scores of 70.35%, 76.19%, 74.63% for ASVP-ESD, JNV, and VIVAE datasets against individual FMs and baseline fusion techniques and report SOTA on the benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

Enhancing the capabilities of NeRFs in open-vocabulary 3D semantic perception tasks has been a recent focus. However, current methods that extract semantics directly from Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) for semantic field learning encounter difficulties due to noisy and view-inconsistent semantics provided by CLIP. To tackle these limitations, we propose OV-NeRF, which exploits the potential of pre-trained vision and language foundation models to enhance semantic field learning through proposed single-view and cross-view strategies. First, from the single-view perspective, we introduce Region Semantic Ranking (RSR) regularization by leveraging 2D mask proposals derived from Segment Anything (SAM) to rectify the noisy semantics of each training view, facilitating accurate semantic field learning. Second, from the cross-view perspective, we propose a Cross-view Self-enhancement (CSE) strategy to address the challenge raised by view-inconsistent semantics. Rather than invariably utilizing the 2D inconsistent semantics from CLIP, CSE leverages the 3D consistent semantics generated from the well-trained semantic field itself for semantic field training, aiming to reduce ambiguity and enhance overall semantic consistency across different views. Extensive experiments validate our OV-NeRF outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving a significant improvement of 20.31% and 18.42% in mIoU metric on Replica and ScanNet, respectively. Furthermore, our approach exhibits consistent superior results across various CLIP configurations, further verifying its robustness.

| **[The Foundational Pose as a Selection Mechanism for the Design of Tool-Wielding Multi-Finger Robotic Hands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14158v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To wield an object means to hold and move it in a way that exploits its functions. When we wield tools -- such as writing with a pen or cutting with scissors -- our hands would reach very specific poses, often drastically different from how we pick up the same objects just to transport them. In this work, we investigate the design of tool-wielding multi-finger robotic hands based on a hypothesis: the poses that a tool and a hand reach during tool-wielding -- what we call "foundational poses" (FPs) -- can be used as a selection mechanism in the design process. We interpret FPs as snapshots that capture the workings of underlying mechanisms formed by the tool and the hand, and one hand can form multiple mechanisms with the same tool. We tested our hypothesis in a hand design experiment, where we developed a sampling-based design optimization framework that uses FPs to computationally generate many different hand designs and evaluate them in multiple metrics. The results show that more than $99\%$ of the $10,785$ generated hand designs successfully wielded tools in simulation, supporting our hypothesis. Meanwhile, our methods provide insights into the non-convex, multi-objective hand design optimization problem that could be hard to unveil otherwise, such as clustering and the Pareto front. Lastly, we demonstrate our methods' real-world feasibility and potential with a hardware prototype equipped with rigid endoskeleton and soft skin.</p></details> |  |

Far-Better Fuse them with Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14131v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, for the first time, we extensively investigate whether music foundation models (MFMs) or speech foundation models (SFMs) work better for singing voice deepfake detection (SVDD), which has recently attracted attention in the research community. For this, we perform a comprehensive comparative study of state-of-the-art (SOTA) MFMs (MERT variants and music2vec) and SFMs (pre-trained for general speech representation learning as well as speaker recognition). We show that speaker recognition SFM representations perform the best amongst all the foundation models (FMs), and this performance can be attributed to its higher efficacy in capturing the pitch, tone, intensity, etc, characteristics present in singing voices. To our end, we also explore the fusion of FMs for exploiting their complementary behavior for improved SVDD, and we propose a novel framework, FIONA for the same. With FIONA, through the synchronization of x-vector (speaker recognition SFM) and MERT-v1-330M (MFM), we report the best performance with the lowest Equal Error Rate (EER) of 13.74 %, beating all the individual FMs as well as baseline FM fusions and achieving SOTA results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models for Amodal Video Instance Segmentation in Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14095v1)** | 2024-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study amodal video instance segmentation for automated driving. Previous works perform amodal video instance segmentation relying on methods trained on entirely labeled video data with techniques borrowed from standard video instance segmentation. Such amodally labeled video data is difficult and expensive to obtain and the resulting methods suffer from a trade-off between instance segmentation and tracking performance. To largely solve this issue, we propose to study the application of foundation models for this task. More precisely, we exploit the extensive knowledge of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), while fine-tuning it to the amodal instance segmentation task. Given an initial video instance segmentation, we sample points from the visible masks to prompt our amodal SAM. We use a point memory to store those points. If a previously observed instance is not predicted in a following frame, we retrieve its most recent points from the point memory and use a point tracking method to follow those points to the current frame, together with the corresponding last amodal instance mask. This way, while basing our method on an amodal instance segmentation, we nevertheless obtain video-level amodal instance segmentation results. Our resulting S-AModal method achieves state-of-the-art results in amodal video instance segmentation while resolving the need for amodal video-based labels. Code for S-AModal is available at https://github.com/ifnspaml/S-AModal.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECCV VCAD Workshop 2024</p></details> |

Accurate modeling of these interactions is important to optimize driving performance, but the relevant physical phenomena are too complex to model from first principles. Therefore, we present an offline meta-learning algorithm to construct a rapidly-tunable model of residual dynamics and disturbances. Our model processes terrain images into features using a visual foundation model (VFM), then maps these features and the vehicle state to an estimate of the current actuation matrix using a deep neural network (DNN). We then combine this model with composite adaptive control to modify the last layer of the DNN in real time, accounting for the remaining terrain interactions not captured during offline training. We provide mathematical guarantees of stability and robustness for our controller and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through simulations and hardware experiments with a tracked vehicle and a car-like robot. We evaluate our method outdoors on different slopes with varying slippage and actuator degradation disturbances, and compare against an adaptive controller that does not use the VFM terrain features. We show significant improvement over the baseline in both hardware experimentation and simulation.</p></details> |  |

While the parallel developments in the AI literature focus on foundation models -- models that can be effectively tuned to address multiple, different use cases -- the developments on the weather and climate side largely focus on single-use cases with particular emphasis on mid-range forecasting. We close this gap by introducing Prithvi WxC, a 2.3 billion parameter foundation model developed using 160 variables from the Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2). Prithvi WxC employs an encoder-decoder-based architecture, incorporating concepts from various recent transformer models to effectively capture both regional and global dependencies in the input data. The model has been designed to accommodate large token counts to model weather phenomena in different topologies at fine resolutions. Furthermore, it is trained with a mixed objective that combines the paradigms of masked reconstruction with forecasting. We test the model on a set of challenging downstream tasks namely: Autoregressive rollout forecasting, Downscaling, Gravity wave flux parameterization, and Extreme events estimation. The pretrained model with 2.3 billion parameters, along with the associated fine-tuning workflows, has been publicly released as an open-source contribution via Hugging Face.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Long-Context Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13530v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have shown impressive performance on a variety of tasks, across a wide range of domains, even in zero-shot settings. However, most of these models are designed to handle short univariate time series as an input. This limits their practical use, especially in domains such as healthcare with copious amounts of long and multivariate data with strong temporal and intra-variate dependencies. Our study bridges this gap by cataloging and systematically comparing various context expansion techniques from both language and time series domains, and introducing a novel compressive memory mechanism to allow encoder-only TSFMs to effectively model intra-variate dependencies. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach by imbuing MOMENT, a recent family of multi-task time series foundation models, with the multivariate context.</p></details> |  |

They play a crucial role in understanding the psychological basis of human behavior and cultural orientation. The Moral Foundation Theory (MFT) is a well-established framework that identifies the core moral foundations underlying the manner in which different cultures shape individual and social lives. Recent advancements in natural language processing, particularly Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), have enabled the extraction and analysis of moral dimensions from textual data. This survey presents a comprehensive review of MFT-informed PLMs, providing an analysis of moral tendencies in PLMs and their application in the context of the MFT. We also review relevant datasets and lexicons and discuss trends, limitations, and future directions. By providing a structured overview of the intersection between PLMs and MFT, this work bridges moral psychology insights within the realm of PLMs, paving the way for further research and development in creating morally aware AI systems.</p></details> |  |

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'24 Main</p></details> |

Existing research has primarily focused on algorithms for specific tasks, which have limited applicability in a broad range of ARS vision applications. This paper proposes the RingMo-Aerial model, aiming to fill the gap in foundation model research in the field of ARS vision. By introducing the Frequency-Enhanced Multi-Head Self-Attention (FE-MSA) mechanism and an affine transformation-based contrastive learning pre-training method, the model's detection capability for small targets is enhanced and optimized for the tilted viewing angles characteristic of ARS. Furthermore, the ARS-Adapter, an efficient parameter fine-tuning method, is proposed to improve the model's adaptability and effectiveness in various ARS vision tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that RingMo-Aerial achieves SOTA performance on multiple downstream tasks. This indicates the practicality and effectiveness of RingMo-Aerial in enhancing the performance of ARS vision tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeAvatar: Robust 3D Facial Animation Transfer by Learning an Expression Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13180v1)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video-driven 3D facial animation transfer aims to drive avatars to reproduce the expressions of actors. Existing methods have achieved remarkable results by constraining both geometric and perceptual consistency. However, geometric constraints (like those designed on facial landmarks) are insufficient to capture subtle emotions, while expression features trained on classification tasks lack fine granularity for complex emotions. To address this, we propose \textbf{FreeAvatar}, a robust facial animation transfer method that relies solely on our learned expression representation. Specifically, FreeAvatar consists of two main components: the expression foundation model and the facial animation transfer model. In the first component, we initially construct a facial feature space through a face reconstruction task and then optimize the expression feature space by exploring the similarities among different expressions. Benefiting from training on the amounts of unlabeled facial images and re-collected expression comparison dataset, our model adapts freely and effectively to any in-the-wild input facial images. In the facial animation transfer component, we propose a novel Expression-driven Multi-avatar Animator, which first maps expressive semantics to the facial control parameters of 3D avatars and then imposes perceptual constraints between the input and output images to maintain expression consistency. To make the entire process differentiable, we employ a trained neural renderer to translate rig parameters into corresponding images. Furthermore, unlike previous methods that require separate decoders for each avatar, we propose a dynamic identity injection module that allows for the joint training of multiple avatars within a single network.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |

Abnormal patterns of neural signaling often indicate the presence of underlying brain diseases. The variability among individuals, the diverse array of clinical symptoms from various brain disorders, and the limited availability of diagnostic classifications, have posed significant barriers to formulating reliable model of neural signals for diverse application contexts. Here, we present BrainWave, the first foundation model for both invasive and non-invasive neural recordings, pretrained on more than 40,000 hours of electrical brain recordings (13.79 TB of data) from approximately 16,000 individuals. Our analysis show that BrainWave outperforms all other competing models and consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in the diagnosis and identification of neurological disorders. We also demonstrate robust capabilities of BrainWave in enabling zero-shot transfer learning across varying recording conditions and brain diseases, as well as few-shot classification without fine-tuning, suggesting that BrainWave learns highly generalizable representations of neural signals. We hence believe that open-sourcing BrainWave will facilitate a wide range of clinical applications in medicine, paving the way for AI-driven approaches to investigate brain disorders and advance neuroscience research.</p></details> | 39 pages, 14 figures |

However, little is known about the concepts that these models learn and how can we manipulate them in the latent space. Our study bridges these gaps by identifying concepts learned by these models, localizing them to specific parts of the model, and steering model predictions along these conceptual directions, using synthetic time series data. Our results show that MOMENT, a state-of-the-art foundation model, can discern distinct time series patterns, and that this ability peaks in the middle layers of the network. Moreover, we show that model outputs can be steered using insights from its activations (e.g., by introducing periodic trends to initially constant signals through intervention during inference). Our findings underscore the importance of synthetic data in studying and steering time series foundation models and intervening throughout the whole model (using steering matrices), instead of a single layer.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoundBeam meets M2D: Target Sound Extraction with Audio Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12528v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Target sound extraction (TSE) consists of isolating a desired sound from a mixture of arbitrary sounds using clues to identify it. A TSE system requires solving two problems at once, identifying the target source and extracting the target signal from the mixture. For increased practicability, the same system should work with various types of sound. The duality of the problem and the wide variety of sounds make it challenging to train a powerful TSE system from scratch. In this paper, to tackle this problem, we explore using a pre-trained audio foundation model that can provide rich feature representations of sounds within a TSE system. We chose the masked-modeling duo (M2D) foundation model, which appears especially suited for the TSE task, as it is trained using a dual objective consisting of sound-label predictions and improved masked prediction. These objectives are related to sound identification and the signal extraction problems of TSE. We propose a new TSE system that integrates the feature representation from M2D into SoundBeam, which is a strong TSE system that can exploit both target sound class labels and pre-recorded enrollments (or audio queries) as clues. We show experimentally that using M2D can increase extraction performance, especially when employing enrollment clues.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSIGene: A Foundation Model For Hyperspectral Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12470v1)** | 2024-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) plays a vital role in various fields such as agriculture and environmental monitoring. However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution.

In this paper, we propose FoME (Foundation Model for EEG), a novel approach using adaptive temporal-lateral attention scaling to address above-mentioned challenges. FoME is pre-trained on a diverse 1.7TB dataset of scalp and intracranial EEG recordings, comprising 745M parameters trained for 1,096k steps. Our model introduces two key innovations: a time-frequency fusion embedding technique and an adaptive time-lateral attention scaling (ATLAS) mechanism. These components synergistically capture complex temporal and spectral EEG dynamics, enabling FoME to adapt to varying patterns across diverse data streams and facilitate robust multi-channel modeling. Evaluations across four downstream tasks demonstrate FoME's superior performance in classification and forecasting applications, consistently achieving state-of-the-art results. To conclude, FoME establishes a new paradigm for EEG analysis, offering a versatile foundation that advances brain-computer interfaces, clinical diagnostics, and cognitive research across neuroscience and related fields. Our code will be available at https://github.com/1061413241/FoME.</p></details> |  |

However, current models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers that fail to capture the full diversity of molecular structures. In this work, we systematically evaluate thirteen chemistry-specific tokenizers for their coverage of the SMILES language, uncovering substantial gaps. Using N-gram language models, we accessed the impact of tokenizer choice on model performance and quantified the information loss of unknown tokens. We introduce two new tokenizers, <i>smirk</i> and <i>smirk-gpe</i>, which can represent the entirety of the OpenSMILES specification while avoiding the pitfalls of existing tokenizers. Our work highlights the importance of open-vocabulary modeling for molecular foundation models and the need for chemically diverse benchmarks for cheminformatics.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

Humans easily infer emotions from situations or facial expressions, situations from emotions, and do a variety of other affective cognition. How adept is modern AI at these inferences? We introduce an evaluation framework for testing affective cognition in foundation models. Starting from psychological theory, we generate 1,280 diverse scenarios exploring relationships between appraisals, emotions, expressions, and outcomes. We evaluate the abilities of foundation models (GPT-4, Claude-3, Gemini-1.5-Pro) and humans (N = 567) across carefully selected conditions. Our results show foundation models tend to agree with human intuitions, matching or exceeding interparticipant agreement. In some conditions, models are ``superhuman'' -- they better predict modal human judgements than the average human. All models benefit from chain-of-thought reasoning. This suggests foundation models have acquired a human-like understanding of emotions and their influence on beliefs and behavior.</p></details> |  |

Existing FMs have struggled to establish sequence-structure alignment, hindering the free flow of genomic information between RNA sequences and structures. In this study, we introduce OmniGenome, an RNA FM trained to align RNA sequences with respect to secondary structures based on structure-contextualised modelling. The alignment enables free and bidirectional mappings between sequences and structures by utilising the flexible RNA modelling paradigm that supports versatile input and output modalities, i.e., sequence and/or structure as input/output. We implement RNA design and zero-shot secondary structure prediction as case studies to evaluate the Seq2Str and Str2Seq mapping capacity of OmniGenome. Results on the EternaV2 benchmark show that OmniGenome solved 74% of puzzles, whereas existing FMs only solved up to 3% of the puzzles due to the oversight of sequence-structure alignment. We leverage four comprehensive in-silico genome modelling benchmarks to evaluate performance across a diverse set of genome downstream tasks, where the results show that OmniGenome achieves state-of-the-art performance on RNA and DNA benchmarks, even without any training on DNA genomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NeurIPS 2024, 19 pages</p></details> |

One approach involves training LLM architectures on tokenized time series data using cross-entropy loss. Although this method has demonstrated promising results, cross-entropy loss is primarily designed for classification tasks and does not account for the distance between classes. To address this limitation, we propose using the Wasserstein loss for such architectures. To validate our approach, we fine-tuned a foundational time series model on $22$ zero-shot datasets, comparing the performance of cross-entropy loss with that of Wasserstein loss. Our results demonstrate that replacing cross-entropy loss with Wasserstein loss significantly improves point estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 mai...</summary><p>4 main pages; 2 figures</p></details> |

Here we introduce the all-in-one (AIO) ANI model architecture based on multimodal learning which can learn an arbitrary number of QC levels. Our all-in-one learning approach offers a more general and easier-to-use alternative to transfer learning. We use it to train the AIO-ANI-UIP foundational model with the generalization capability comparable to semi-empirical GFN2-xTB and DFT with a double-zeta basis set for organic molecules. We show that the AIO-ANI model can learn across different QC levels ranging from semi-empirical to density functional theory to coupled cluster. We also use AIO models to design the foundational model {\Delta}-AIO-ANI based on {\Delta}-learning with increased accuracy and robustness compared to AIO-ANI-UIP. The code and the foundational models are available at https://github.com/dralgroup/aio-ani; they will be integrated into the universal and updatable AI-enhanced QM (UAIQM) library and made available in the MLatom package so that they can be used online at the XACS cloud computing platform (see https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom for updates).</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce a novel food computing foundation model that achieves true multimodality, encompassing tasks such as t2t, t2i, i2t, it2t, and t2ti. By leveraging large language models (LLMs) and pre-trained image encoder and decoder models, our model can perform a diverse array of food computing-related tasks, including food understanding, food recognition, recipe generation, and food image generation. Compared to previous models, our foundation model demonstrates a significantly broader range of capabilities and exhibits superior performance, particularly in food image generation and recipe generation tasks.

In this paper, we introduce a training-as-compressing perspective, wherein the model's weights embody a compressed representation of the training data. From a copyright standpoint, this point of view implies that the weights could be considered a reproduction or a derivative work of a potentially protected set of works. We investigate the technical and legal challenges that emerge from this framing of the copyright of outputs generated by foundation models, including their implications for practitioners and researchers.

However, current approaches to solve these tasks use independently trained models, which may not benefit from large amounts of unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose M-BEST-RQ, the first multi-channel speech foundation model for smart glasses, which is designed to leverage large-scale self-supervised learning (SSL) in an array-geometry agnostic approach. While prior work on multi-channel speech SSL only evaluated on simulated settings, we curate a suite of real downstream tasks to evaluate our model, namely (i) conversational automatic speech recognition (ASR), (ii) spherical active source localization, and (iii) glasses wearer voice activity detection, which are sourced from the MMCSG and EasyCom datasets. We show that a general-purpose M-BEST-RQ encoder is able to match or surpass supervised models across all tasks. For the conversational ASR task in particular, using only 8 hours of labeled speech, our model outperforms a supervised ASR baseline that is trained on 2000 hours of labeled data, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>In su...</summary><p>In submission to IEEE ICASSP 2025</p></details> |

However, their application to sensitive, domain-specific fields like healthcare remains challenging, primarily due to the difficulty of fine-tuning these models for specialized, out-of-domain tasks with scarce publicly available datasets. In this work, we explore the use of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques to address these limitations, focusing on healthcare applications, particularly ICU vitals forecasting for sepsis patients. We introduce and evaluate two selective (BitFit and LayerNorm Tuning) and two additive (VeRA and FourierFT) PEFT techniques on multiple configurations of the Chronos TSFM for forecasting vital signs of sepsis patients. Our comparative analysis demonstrates that some of these PEFT methods outperform LoRA in terms of parameter efficiency and domain adaptation, establishing state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in ICU vital forecasting tasks. Interestingly, FourierFT applied to the Chronos (Tiny) variant surpasses the SOTA model while fine-tuning only 2,400 parameters compared to the 700K parameters of the benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

| **[Exploring Prediction Targets in Masked Pre-Training for Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10788v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech foundation models, such as HuBERT and its variants, are pre-trained on large amounts of unlabeled speech for various downstream tasks. These models use a masked prediction objective, where the model learns to predict information about masked input segments from the unmasked context. The choice of prediction targets in this framework can influence performance on downstream tasks. For example, targets that encode prosody are beneficial for speaker-related tasks, while targets that encode phonetics are more suited for content-related tasks. Additionally, prediction targets can vary in the level of detail they encode; targets that encode fine-grained acoustic details are beneficial for denoising tasks, while targets that encode higher-level abstractions are more suited for content-related tasks. Despite the importance of prediction targets, the design choices that affect them have not been thoroughly studied. This work explores the design choices and their impact on downstream task performance. Our results indicate that the commonly used design choices for HuBERT can be suboptimal. We propose novel approaches to create more informative prediction targets and demonstrate their effectiveness through improvements across various downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Foundation Models to the Rescue: Deadlock Resolution in Connected Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06413v2)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Connected multi-agent robotic systems (MRS) are prone to deadlocks in an obstacle environment where the robots can get stuck away from their desired locations under a smooth low-level control policy. Without an external intervention, often in terms of a high-level command, a low-level control policy cannot resolve such deadlocks. Utilizing the generalizability and low data requirements of foundation models, this paper explores the possibility of using text-based models, i.e., large language models (LLMs), and text-and-image-based models, i.e., vision-language models (VLMs), as high-level planners for deadlock resolution. We propose a hierarchical control framework where a foundation model-based high-level planner helps to resolve deadlocks by assigning a leader to the MRS along with a set of waypoints for the MRS leader. Then, a low-level distributed control policy based on graph neural networks is executed to safely follow these waypoints, thereby evading the deadlock. We conduct extensive experiments on various MRS environments using the best available pre-trained LLMs and VLMs. We compare their performance with a graph-based planner in terms of effectiveness in helping the MRS reach their target locations and computational time. Our results illustrate that, compared to grid-based planners, the foundation models perform better in terms of the goal-reaching rate and computational time for complex environments, which helps us conclude that foundation models can assist MRS operating in complex obstacle-cluttered environments to resolve deadlocks efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rapid Adaptation of Earth Observation Foundation Models for Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09907v1)** | 2024-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the efficacy of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in fine-tuning Earth Observation (EO) foundation models for flood segmentation. We hypothesize that LoRA, a parameter-efficient technique, can significantly accelerate the adaptation of large-scale EO models to this critical task while maintaining high performance. We apply LoRA to fine-tune a state-of-the-art EO foundation model pre-trained on diverse satellite imagery, using a curated dataset of flood events. Our results demonstrate that LoRA-based fine-tuning (r-256) improves F1 score by 6.66 points and IoU by 0.11 compared to a frozen encoder baseline, while significantly reducing computational costs. Notably, LoRA outperforms full fine-tuning, which proves computationally infeasible on our hardware. We further assess generalization through out-of-distribution (OOD) testing on a geographically distinct flood event. While LoRA configurations show improved OOD performance over the baseline. This work contributes to research on efficient adaptation of foundation models for specialized EO tasks, with implications for rapid response systems in disaster management. Our findings demonstrate LoRA's potential for enabling faster deployment of accurate flood segmentation models in resource-constrained, time-critical scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages 2 figures |
| **[Estimating Wage Disparities Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09894v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One thread of empirical work in social science focuses on decomposing group differences in outcomes into unexplained components and components explained by observable factors. In this paper, we study gender wage decompositions, which require estimating the portion of the gender wage gap explained by career histories of workers. Classical methods for decomposing the wage gap employ simple predictive models of wages which condition on a small set of simple summaries of labor history. The problem is that these predictive models cannot take advantage of the full complexity of a worker's history, and the resulting decompositions thus suffer from omitted variable bias (OVB), where covariates that are correlated with both gender and wages are not included in the model. Here we explore an alternative methodology for wage gap decomposition that employs powerful foundation models, such as large language models, as the predictive engine. Foundation models excel at making accurate predictions from complex, high-dimensional inputs. We use a custom-built foundation model, designed to predict wages from full labor histories, to decompose the gender wage gap. We prove that the way such models are usually trained might still lead to OVB, but develop fine-tuning algorithms that empirically mitigate this issue. Our model captures a richer representation of career history than simple models and predicts wages more accurately. In detail, we first provide a novel set of conditions under which an estimator of the wage gap based on a fine-tuned foundation model is $\sqrt{n}$-consistent. Building on the theory, we then propose methods for fine-tuning foundation models that minimize OVB. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find that history explains more of the gender wage gap than standard econometric models can measure, and we identify elements of history that are important for reducing OVB.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods require pre-constructed 3D scenes and face scalability issues due to per-point feature vector learning, limiting their efficacy with complex queries. Our method overcomes these limitations by incrementally building instance-level 3D scene representations using 2D foundation models, efficiently aggregating instance-level details such as masks, feature vectors, names, and captions. We introduce fusion schemes for feature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on complex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust automatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluate our proposed approach on multiple scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrating zero-shot generalization capabilities, exceeding current state-of-the-art methods in open world 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://opensu3d.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Veridical Data Science for Medical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10580v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of foundation models (FMs) such as large language models (LLMs) has led to a cultural shift in data science, both in medicine and beyond. This shift involves moving away from specialized predictive models trained for specific, well-defined domain questions to generalist FMs pre-trained on vast amounts of unstructured data, which can then be adapted to various clinical tasks and questions. As a result, the standard data science workflow in medicine has been fundamentally altered; the foundation model lifecycle (FMLC) now includes distinct upstream and downstream processes, in which computational resources, model and data access, and decision-making power are distributed among multiple stakeholders. At their core, FMs are fundamentally statistical models, and this new workflow challenges the principles of Veridical Data Science (VDS), hindering the rigorous statistical analysis expected in transparent and scientifically reproducible data science practices. We critically examine the medical FMLC in light of the core principles of VDS: predictability, computability, and stability (PCS), and explain how it deviates from the standard data science workflow. Finally, we propose recommendations for a reimagined medical FMLC that expands and refines the PCS principles for VDS including considering the computational and accessibility constraints inherent to FMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PROSE-FD: A Multimodal PDE Foundation Model for Learning Multiple Operators for Forecasting Fluid Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09811v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose PROSE-FD, a zero-shot multimodal PDE foundational model for simultaneous prediction of heterogeneous two-dimensional physical systems related to distinct fluid dynamics settings. These systems include shallow water equations and the Navier-Stokes equations with incompressible and compressible flow, regular and complex geometries, and different buoyancy settings. This work presents a new transformer-based multi-operator learning approach that fuses symbolic information to perform operator-based data prediction, i.e. non-autoregressive. By incorporating multiple modalities in the inputs, the PDE foundation model builds in a pathway for including mathematical descriptions of the physical behavior. We pre-train our foundation model on 6 parametric families of equations collected from 13 datasets, including over 60K trajectories. Our model outperforms popular operator learning, computer vision, and multi-physics models, in benchmark forward prediction tasks. We test our architecture choices with ablation studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Foundation Models for Music Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09601v1)** | 2024-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Music is essential in daily life, fulfilling emotional and entertainment needs, and connecting us personally, socially, and culturally. A better understanding of music can enhance our emotions, cognitive skills, and cultural connections. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced new ways to analyze music, aiming to replicate human understanding of music and provide related services. While the traditional models focused on audio features and simple tasks, the recent development of large language models (LLMs) and foundation models (FMs), which excel in various fields by integrating semantic information and demonstrating strong reasoning abilities, could capture complex musical features and patterns, integrate music with language and incorporate rich musical, emotional and psychological knowledge. Therefore, they have the potential in handling complex music understanding tasks from a semantic perspective, producing outputs closer to human perception. This work, to our best knowledge, is one of the early reviews of the intersection of AI techniques and music understanding. We investigated, analyzed, and tested recent large-scale music foundation models in respect of their music comprehension abilities. We also discussed their limitations and proposed possible future directions, offering insights for researchers in this field.</p></details> | 20 pages, 2 figures |
| **[COMFORT: A Continual Fine-Tuning Framework for Foundation Models Targeted at Consumer Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09549v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wearable medical sensors (WMSs) are revolutionizing smart healthcare by enabling continuous, real-time monitoring of user physiological signals, especially in the field of consumer healthcare. The integration of WMSs and modern machine learning (ML) enables unprecedented solutions to efficient early-stage disease detection. Despite the success of Transformers in various fields, their application to sensitive domains, such as smart healthcare, remains underexplored due to limited data accessibility and privacy concerns. To bridge the gap between Transformer-based foundation models and WMS-based disease detection, we propose COMFORT, a continual fine-tuning framework for foundation models targeted at consumer healthcare. COMFORT introduces a novel approach for pre-training a Transformer-based foundation model on a large dataset of physiological signals exclusively collected from healthy individuals with commercially available WMSs. We adopt a masked data modeling (MDM) objective to pre-train this health foundation model. We then fine-tune the model using various parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, to adapt it to various downstream disease detection tasks that rely on WMS data. In addition, COMFORT continually stores the low-rank decomposition matrices obtained from the PEFT algorithms to construct a library for multi-disease detection. The COMFORT library enables scalable and memory-efficient disease detection on edge devices. Our experimental results demonstrate that COMFORT achieves highly competitive performance while reducing memory overhead by up to 52% relative to conventional methods. Thus, COMFORT paves the way for personalized and proactive solutions to efficient and effective early-stage disease detection for consumer healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures.

| **[InfMAE: A Foundation Model in the Infrared Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00407v2)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the foundation models have swept the computer vision field and facilitated the development of various tasks within different modalities. However, it remains an open question on how to design an infrared foundation model. In this paper, we propose InfMAE, a foundation model in infrared modality. We release an infrared dataset, called Inf30 to address the problem of lacking large-scale data for self-supervised learning in the infrared vision community. Besides, we design an information-aware masking strategy, which is suitable for infrared images. This masking strategy allows for a greater emphasis on the regions with richer information in infrared images during the self-supervised learning process, which is conducive to learning the generalized representation. In addition, we adopt a multi-scale encoder to enhance the performance of the pre-trained encoders in downstream tasks. Finally, based on the fact that infrared images do not have a lot of details and texture information, we design an infrared decoder module, which further improves the performance of downstream tasks. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method InfMAE outperforms other supervised methods and self-supervised learning methods in three downstream tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[On the Generalizability of Foundation Models for Crop Type Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09451v1)** | 2024-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained using self-supervised and weakly-supervised learning have shown powerful transfer learning capabilities on various downstream tasks, including language understanding, text generation, and image recognition. Recently, the Earth observation (EO) field has produced several foundation models pre-trained directly on multispectral satellite imagery (e.g., Sentinel-2) for applications like precision agriculture, wildfire and drought monitoring, and natural disaster response. However, few studies have investigated the ability of these models to generalize to new geographic locations, and potential concerns of geospatial bias -- models trained on data-rich developed countries not transferring well to data-scarce developing countries -- remain. We investigate the ability of popular EO foundation models to transfer to new geographic regions in the agricultural domain, where differences in farming practices and class imbalance make transfer learning particularly challenging. We first select six crop classification datasets across five continents, normalizing for dataset size and harmonizing classes to focus on four major cereal grains: maize, soybean, rice, and wheat. We then compare three popular foundation models, pre-trained on SSL4EO-S12, SatlasPretrain, and ImageNet, using in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluation. Experiments show that pre-trained weights designed explicitly for Sentinel-2, such as SSL4EO-S12, outperform general pre-trained weights like ImageNet. Furthermore, the benefits of pre-training on OOD data are the most significant when only 10--100 ID training samples are used. Transfer learning and pre-training with OOD and limited ID data show promising applications, as many developing regions have scarce crop type labels. All harmonized datasets and experimental code are open-source and available for download.</p></details> |  |
