| **[CausalGeD: Blending Causality and Diffusion for Spatial Gene Expression Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07751v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) data is crucial for understanding gene expression in spatial context. Existing methods for such integration have limited performance, with structural similarity often below 60\%, We attribute this limitation to the failure to consider causal relationships between genes. We present CausalGeD, which combines diffusion and autoregressive processes to leverage these relationships. By generalizing the Causal Attention Transformer from image generation to gene expression data, our model captures regulatory mechanisms without predefined relationships. Across 10 tissue datasets, CausalGeD outperformed state-of-the-art baselines by 5- 32\% in key metrics, including Pearson's correlation and structural similarity, advancing both technical and biological insights.</p></details> |  |

Spatial computing enables interaction with virtual elements through natural input methods such as eye tracking, hand gestures, and voice commands, thus placing natural human-computer interaction at its core. While previous surveys have reviewed conventional XR interaction techniques, recent advancements in natural interaction, particularly driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLMs), have introduced new paradigms and technologies. In this paper, we review research on multimodal natural interaction for wearable XR, focusing on papers published between 2022 and 2024 in six top venues: ACM CHI, UIST, IMWUT (Ubicomp), IEEE VR, ISMAR, and TVCG. We classify and analyze these studies based on application scenarios, operation types, and interaction modalities. This analysis provides a structured framework for understanding how researchers are designing advanced natural interaction techniques in XR. Based on these findings, we discuss the challenges in natural interaction techniques and suggest potential directions for future research. This review provides valuable insights for researchers aiming to design natural and efficient interaction systems for XR, ultimately contributing to the advancement of spatial computing.</p></details> | 28 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Distributed Coverage Control for Time-Varying Spatial Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07595v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems are essential for environmental monitoring, particularly for tracking spatial phenomena like pollution, soil minerals, and water salinity, and more. This study addresses the challenge of deploying a multi-robot team for optimal coverage in environments where the density distribution, describing areas of interest, is unknown and changes over time. We propose a fully distributed control strategy that uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the spatial field and balance the trade-off between learning the field and optimally covering it. Unlike existing approaches, we address a more realistic scenario by handling time-varying spatial fields, where the exploration-exploitation trade-off is dynamically adjusted over time. Each robot operates locally, using only its own collected data and the information shared by the neighboring robots. To address the computational limits of GPs, the algorithm efficiently manages the volume of data by selecting only the most relevant samples for the process estimation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through several simulations and experiments, incorporating real-world data phenomena to validate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SketchFlex: Facilitating Spatial-Semantic Coherence in Text-to-Image Generation with Region-Based Sketches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07556v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models can generate visually appealing images from text descriptions. Efforts have been devoted to improving model controls with prompt tuning and spatial conditioning. However, our formative study highlights the challenges for non-expert users in crafting appropriate prompts and specifying fine-grained spatial conditions (e.g., depth or canny references) to generate semantically cohesive images, especially when multiple objects are involved. In response, we introduce SketchFlex, an interactive system designed to improve the flexibility of spatially conditioned image generation using rough region sketches. The system automatically infers user prompts with rational descriptions within a semantic space enriched by crowd-sourced object attributes and relationships. Additionally, SketchFlex refines users' rough sketches into canny-based shape anchors, ensuring the generation quality and alignment of user intentions. Experimental results demonstrate that SketchFlex achieves more cohesive image generations than end-to-end models, meanwhile significantly reducing cognitive load and better matching user intentions compared to region-based generation baseline.</p></details> | conference: CHI2025 |
| **[Visual-based spatial audio generation system for multi-speaker environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07538v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multimedia applications such as films and video games, spatial audio techniques are widely employed to enhance user experiences by simulating 3D sound: transforming mono audio into binaural formats. However, this process is often complex and labor-intensive for sound designers, requiring precise synchronization of audio with the spatial positions of visual components. To address these challenges, we propose a visual-based spatial audio generation system - an automated system that integrates face detection YOLOv8 for object detection, monocular depth estimation, and spatial audio techniques. Notably, the system operates without requiring additional binaural dataset training. The proposed system is evaluated against existing Spatial Audio generation system using objective metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves spatial consistency between audio and video, enhances speech quality, and performs robustly in multi-speaker scenarios. By streamlining the audio-visual alignment process, the proposed system enables sound engineers to achieve high-quality results efficiently, making it a valuable tool for professionals in multimedia production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent Diffusion Model for Compressed Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07381v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to limitations of storage and bandwidth, videos stored and transmitted on the Internet are usually low-quality with low-resolution and compression noise. Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient technique to enhance video resolution, relatively VSR methods focus on compressed videos. Directly applying general VSR approaches leads to the failure of improving practical videos, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. Recently, diffusion models have achieved superior performance in low-level visual tasks, and their high-realism generation capability enables them to be applied in VSR. To synthesize more compression-lost details and refine temporal consistency, we propose a novel Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model for compressed VSR. Specifically, we introduce a distortion Control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs and guide the generation. Next, the diffusion model executes the denoising process for texture generation with fine-tuned spatial prompt-based compression-aware module (PCAM) and spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). PCAM extracts features to encode specific compression information dynamically. STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism to a spatio-temporal dimension for capturing temporal correlation. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in enhancing compressed videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Criterion for Aggregation Error for Multivariate Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12287v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The criterion for aggregation error (CAGE) is an important metric that aims to measure errors that arise in multiscale (or multi-resolution) spatial data, referred to as the modifiable areal unit problem and the ecological fallacy. Specifically, CAGE is a measure of between scale variance of eigenvectors in a Karhunen-Lo\'{e}ve expansion (KLE), motivated by a theoretical result, referred to as the ``null-MAUP-theorem,'' that states that the MAUP/ecological fallacy are not present when this variance is zero. CAGE was originally developed for univariate spatial data, but its use has been applied to multivariate spatial data without the development of a null-MAUP-theorem in the multivariate spatial setting. To fill this gap, we provide theoretical justification for a multivariate CAGE (MVCAGE), which includes multiscale multivariate extensions of the KLE, Mercer's theorem, and the-null-MAUP theorem. Additionally, we provide technical results that demonstrate that the MVCAGE is preferable to spatial-only CAGE, and extend commonly used basis functions used to compute CAGE to the multivariate spatial setting. Empirical results are provided to demonstrate the use of MVCAGE for uncertainty quantification and regionalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding for medical image segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06997v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have been used extensively for high quality image and video generation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel conditional diffusion model with spatial attention and latent embedding (cDAL) for medical image segmentation. In cDAL, a convolutional neural network (CNN) based discriminator is used at every time-step of the diffusion process to distinguish between the generated labels and the real ones. A spatial attention map is computed based on the features learned by the discriminator to help cDAL generate more accurate segmentation of discriminative regions in an input image. Additionally, we incorporated a random latent embedding into each layer of our model to significantly reduce the number of training and sampling time-steps, thereby making it much faster than other diffusion models for image segmentation. We applied cDAL on 3 publicly available medical image segmentation datasets (MoNuSeg, Chest X-ray and Hippocampus) and observed significant qualitative and quantitative improvements with higher Dice scores and mIoU over the state-of-the-art algorithms. The source code is publicly available at https://github.com/Hejrati/cDAL/.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables, Accepted in MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Visual Agentic AI for Spatial Reasoning with a Dynamic API](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06787v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual reasoning -- the ability to interpret the visual world -- is crucial for embodied agents that operate within three-dimensional scenes. Progress in AI has led to vision and language models capable of answering questions from images. However, their performance declines when tasked with 3D spatial reasoning. To tackle the complexity of such reasoning problems, we introduce an agentic program synthesis approach where LLM agents collaboratively generate a Pythonic API with new functions to solve common subproblems. Our method overcomes limitations of prior approaches that rely on a static, human-defined API, allowing it to handle a wider range of queries. To assess AI capabilities for 3D understanding, we introduce a new benchmark of queries involving multiple steps of grounding and inference. We show that our method outperforms prior zero-shot models for visual reasoning in 3D and empirically validate the effectiveness of our agentic framework for 3D spatial reasoning tasks.

| **[Multi-Scale Feature Fusion with Image-Driven Spatial Integration for Left Atrium Segmentation from Cardiac MRI Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06615v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of the left atrium (LA) from late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging plays a vital role in visualizing diseased atrial structures, enabling the diagnosis and management of cardiovascular diseases. It is particularly essential for planning treatment with ablation therapy, a key intervention for atrial fibrillation (AF). However, manual segmentation is time-intensive and prone to inter-observer variability, underscoring the need for automated solutions. Class-agnostic foundation models like DINOv2 have demonstrated remarkable feature extraction capabilities in vision tasks. However, their lack of domain specificity and task-specific adaptation can reduce spatial resolution during feature extraction, impacting the capture of fine anatomical detail in medical imaging. To address this limitation, we propose a segmentation framework that integrates DINOv2 as an encoder with a UNet-style decoder, incorporating multi-scale feature fusion and input image integration to enhance segmentation accuracy. The learnable weighting mechanism dynamically prioritizes hierarchical features from different encoder blocks of the foundation model, optimizing feature selection for task relevance. Additionally, the input image is reintroduced during the decoding stage to preserve high-resolution spatial details, addressing limitations of downsampling in the encoder. We validate our approach on the LAScarQS 2022 dataset and demonstrate improved performance with a 92.3% Dice and 84.1% IoU score for giant architecture compared to the nnUNet baseline model. These findings emphasize the efficacy of our approach in advancing the field of automated left atrium segmentation from cardiac MRI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Select before Act: Spatially Decoupled Action Repetition for Continuous Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06919v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has achieved remarkable success in various continuous control tasks, such as robot manipulation and locomotion. Different to mainstream RL which makes decisions at individual steps, recent studies have incorporated action repetition into RL, achieving enhanced action persistence with improved sample efficiency and superior performance. However, existing methods treat all action dimensions as a whole during repetition, ignoring variations among them. This constraint leads to inflexibility in decisions, which reduces policy agility with inferior effectiveness. In this work, we propose a novel repetition framework called SDAR, which implements Spatially Decoupled Action Repetition through performing closed-loop act-or-repeat selection for each action dimension individually. SDAR achieves more flexible repetition strategies, leading to an improved balance between action persistence and diversity. Compared to existing repetition frameworks, SDAR is more sample efficient with higher policy performance and reduced action fluctuation. Experiments are conducted on various continuous control scenarios, demonstrating the effectiveness of spatially decoupled repetition design proposed in this work.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |
| **[Structure-preserving contrastive learning for spatial time series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06380v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Informative representations enhance model performance and generalisability in downstream tasks. However, learning self-supervised representations for spatially characterised time series, like traffic interactions, poses challenges as it requires maintaining fine-grained similarity relations in the latent space. In this study, we incorporate two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance contrastive learning and structure preservation, we propose a dynamic mechanism that adaptively weighs the trade-off and stabilises training. We conduct experiments on multivariate time series classification, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction. For all three tasks, our approach preserves the structures of similarity relations more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. The proposed approach can be applied to an arbitrary encoder and is particularly beneficial for time series with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, this study suggests that higher similarity structure preservation indicates more informative and useful representations. This may help to understand the contribution of representation learning in pattern recognition with neural networks. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt.</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |
| **[New Insight of Spatial Scan Statistics via Regression Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06347v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial scan statistic is widely used to detect disease clusters in epidemiological surveillance. Since the seminal work by~\cite{kulldorff1997}, numerous extensions have emerged, including methods for defining scan regions, detecting multiple clusters, and expanding statistical models. Notably,~\cite{jung2009} and~\cite{ZHANG20092851} introduced a regression-based approach accounting for covariates, encompassing classical methods such as those of~\cite{kulldorff1997}. Another key extension is the expectation-based approach~\citep{neill2005anomalous,neillphdthesis}, which differs from the population-based approach represented by~\cite{kulldorff1997} in terms of hypothesis testing. In this paper, we bridge the regression-based approach with both expectation-based and population-based approaches. We reveal that the two approaches are separated by a simple difference: the presence or absence of an intercept term in the regression model. Exploiting the above simple difference, we propose new spatial scan statistics under the Gaussian and Bernoulli models. We further extend the regression-based approach by incorporating the well-known sparse L0 penalty and show that the derivation of spatial scan statistics can be expressed as an equivalent optimization problem. Our extended framework accommodates extensions such as space-time scan statistics and detecting multiple clusters while naturally connecting with existing spatial regression-based cluster detection. Considering the relation to case-specific models~\citep{she2011,10.1214/11-STS377}, clusters detected by spatial scan statistics can be viewed as outliers in terms of robust statistics. Numerical experiments with real data illustrate the behavior of our proposed statistics under specified settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decentralized Inference for Spatial Data Using Low-Rank Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00309v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in information technology have enabled the creation of massive spatial datasets, driving the need for scalable and efficient computational methodologies. While offering viable solutions, centralized frameworks are limited by vulnerabilities such as single-point failures and communication bottlenecks. This paper presents a decentralized framework tailored for parameter inference in spatial low-rank models to address these challenges. A key obstacle arises from the spatial dependence among observations, which prevents the log-likelihood from being expressed as a summation-a critical requirement for decentralized optimization approaches. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel objective function leveraging the evidence lower bound, which facilitates the use of decentralized optimization techniques. Our approach employs a block descent method integrated with multi-consensus and dynamic consensus averaging for effective parameter optimization. We prove the convexity of the new objective function in the vicinity of the true parameters, ensuring the convergence of the proposed method. Additionally, we present the first theoretical results establishing the consistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator within the context of spatial low-rank models. Extensive simulations and real-world data experiments corroborate these theoretical findings, showcasing the robustness and scalability of the framework.</p></details> | 84 pages |

In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, our method integrates pixel-wise vision-language features with curiosity-driven exploration. This approach enables robust navigation to human-instructed instances across diverse environments. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and evaluate its performance through comprehensive navigation tasks in both indoor and outdoor environments, spanning different scales and semantic complexities. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Interpretable Implicit-Based Approach for Modeling Local Spatial Effects: A Case Study of Global Gross Primary Productivity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06170v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Earth sciences, unobserved factors exhibit non-stationary spatial distributions, causing the relationships between features and targets to display spatial heterogeneity. In geographic machine learning tasks, conventional statistical learning methods often struggle to capture spatial heterogeneity, leading to unsatisfactory prediction accuracy and unreliable interpretability. While approaches like Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) capture local variations, they fall short of uncovering global patterns and tracking the continuous evolution of spatial heterogeneity. Motivated by this limitation, we propose a novel perspective - that is, simultaneously modeling common features across different locations alongside spatial differences using deep neural networks. The proposed method is a dual-branch neural network with an encoder-decoder structure. In the encoding stage, the method aggregates node information in a spatiotemporal conditional graph using GCN and LSTM, encoding location-specific spatiotemporal heterogeneity as an implicit conditional vector. Additionally, a self-attention-based encoder is used to extract location-invariant common features from the data. In the decoding stage, the approach employs a conditional generation strategy that predicts response variables and interpretative weights based on data features under spatiotemporal conditions. The approach is validated by predicting vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) using global climate and land cover data from 2001 to 2020. Trained on 50 million samples and tested on 2.8 million, the proposed model achieves an RMSE of 0.836, outperforming LightGBM (1.063) and TabNet (0.944). Visualization analyses indicate that our method can reveal the distribution differences of the dominant factors of GPP across various times and locations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lipschitz-Driven Inference: Bias-corrected Confidence Intervals for Spatial Linear Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06067v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear models remain ubiquitous in modern spatial applications - including climate science, public health, and economics - due to their interpretability, speed, and reproducibility. While practitioners generally report a form of uncertainty, popular spatial uncertainty quantification methods do not jointly handle model misspecification and distribution shift - despite both being essentially always present in spatial problems. In the present paper, we show that existing methods for constructing confidence (or credible) intervals in spatial linear models fail to provide correct coverage due to unaccounted-for bias. In contrast to classical methods that rely on an i.i.d. assumption that is inappropriate in spatial problems, in the present work we instead make a spatial smoothness (Lipschitz) assumption. We are then able to propose a new confidence-interval construction that accounts for bias in the estimation procedure. We demonstrate that our new method achieves nominal coverage via both theory and experiments. Code to reproduce experiments is available at https://github.com/DavidRBurt/Lipschitz-Driven-Inference.</p></details> | 34 pages; 15 figures |
| **[Traveling Waves Integrate Spatial Information Into Spectral Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06034v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling waves are widely observed in the brain, but their precise computational function remains unclear. One prominent hypothesis is that they enable the transfer and integration of spatial information across neural populations. However, few computational models have explored how traveling waves might be harnessed to perform such integrative processing. Drawing inspiration from the famous ``Can one hear the shape of a drum?'' problem -- which highlights how spectral modes encode geometric information -- we introduce a set of convolutional recurrent neural networks that learn to produce traveling waves in their hidden states in response to visual stimuli. By applying a spectral decomposition to these wave-like activations, we obtain a powerful new representational space that outperforms equivalently local feed-forward networks on tasks requiring global spatial context. In particular, we observe that traveling waves effectively expand the receptive field of locally connected neurons, supporting long-range encoding and communication of information. We demonstrate that models equipped with this mechanism and spectral readouts solve visual semantic segmentation tasks demanding global integration, where local feed-forward models fail. As a first step toward traveling-wave-based representations in artificial networks, our findings suggest potential efficiency benefits and offer a new framework for connecting to biological recordings of neural activity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximate Bayesian inference for joint partially linear modeling of longitudinal measurements and spatial time-to-event data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05880v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of longitudinal measurements and survival time in statistical modeling offers a powerful framework for capturing the interplay between these two essential outcomes, particularly when they exhibit associations. However, in scenarios where spatial dependencies among entities are present due to geographic regions, traditional approaches may fall short. In response, this paper introduces a novel approximate Bayesian hierarchical model tailored for jointly analyzing longitudinal and spatial survival outcomes. The model leverages a conditional autoregressive structure to incorporate spatial effects, while simultaneously employing a joint partially linear model to capture the nonlinear influence of time on longitudinal responses. Through extensive simulation studies, the efficacy of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated. Furthermore, its practical utility is demonstrated through an application to real-world HIV/AIDS data sourced from various Brazilian states, showcasing its adaptability and relevance in epidemiological research.</p></details> | 23 |
| **[Neuro-symbolic Training for Reasoning over Spatial Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13828v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial reasoning based on natural language expressions is essential for everyday human tasks. This reasoning ability is also crucial for machines to interact with their environment in a human-like manner. However, recent research shows that even state-of-the-art language models struggle with spatial reasoning over text, especially when facing nesting spatial expressions. This is attributed to not achieving the right level of abstraction required for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose training language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that exploit the spatial logical rules as constraints, providing additional supervision to improve spatial reasoning and question answering. Training language models to adhere to spatial reasoning rules guides them in making more effective and general abstractions for transferring spatial knowledge to various domains. We evaluate our approach on existing spatial question-answering benchmarks. Our results indicate the effectiveness of our proposed technique in improving language models in complex multi-hop spatial reasoning over text.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, NAACL 2025 findings</p></details> |
| **[From Zero-Freeness to Strong Spatial Mixing via a Christoffel-Darboux Type Identity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09317v3)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unifying proof to derive the strong spatial mixing (SSM) property for the general 2-spin system from zero-free regions of its partition function. Our proof works for the multivariate partition function over all three complex parameters $(\beta, \gamma, \lambda)$, and we allow the zero-free regions of $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ to be of arbitrary shapes. Our main technical contribution is to establish a Christoffel-Darboux type identity for the 2-spin system on trees so that we are able to handle zero-free regions of the three different parameters $\beta, \gamma$ or $\lambda$ in a unified way. We use Riemann mapping theorem to deal with zere-free regions of arbitrary shapes. Our result comprehensively turns all existing zero-free regions (to our best knowledge) of the partition function of the 2-spin system where pinned vertices are allowed into the SSM property. As a consequence, we obtain novel SSM properties for the 2-spin system beyond the direct argument for SSM based on tree recurrence. Moreover, we extend our result to handle the 2-spin system with non-uniform external fields. As an application, we obtain a new SSM property and two new forms of spatial mixing property, namely plus and minus spatial mixing for the non-uniform ferromagnetic Ising model from the celebrated Lee-Yang circle theorem.</p></details> | <details><summary>v3 up...</summary><p>v3 updates: Two forms of spatial mixing results was added (Theorem 6).

| **[Marine spatial planning techniques with a case study on wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11926v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As emerging marine technologies lead to the development of new infrastructure across the ocean, they enter an environment that existing ecosystems and industries already rely on. Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImmerseDiffusion: A Generative Spatial Audio Latent Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14945v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ImmerseDiffusion, an end-to-end generative audio model that produces 3D immersive soundscapes conditioned on the spatial, temporal, and environmental conditions of sound objects. ImmerseDiffusion is trained to generate first-order ambisonics (FOA) audio, which is a conventional spatial audio format comprising four channels that can be rendered to multichannel spatial output. The proposed generative system is composed of a spatial audio codec that maps FOA audio to latent components, a latent diffusion model trained based on various user input types, namely, text prompts, spatial, temporal and environmental acoustic parameters, and optionally a spatial audio and text encoder trained in a Contrastive Language and Audio Pretraining (CLAP) style. We propose metrics to evaluate the quality and spatial adherence of the generated spatial audio. Finally, we assess the model performance in terms of generation quality and spatial conformance, comparing the two proposed modes: ``descriptive", which uses spatial text prompts) and ``parametric", which uses non-spatial text prompts and spatial parameters. Our evaluations demonstrate promising results that are consistent with the user conditions and reflect reliable spatial fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICASS...</summary><p>ICASSP 2025 - IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, 2025</p></details> |
| **[SACNet: A Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network for 2D Multi-organ Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10157v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-organ segmentation in medical image analysis is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many factors complicate the task, including variability in different target categories and interference from complex backgrounds. In this paper, we utilize the knowledge of Deformable Convolution V3 (DCNv3) and multi-object segmentation to optimize our Spatially Adaptive Convolution Network (SACNet) in three aspects: feature extraction, model architecture, and loss constraint, simultaneously enhancing the perception of different segmentation targets. Firstly, we propose the Adaptive Receptive Field Module (ARFM), which combines DCNv3 with a series of customized block-level and architecture-level designs similar to transformers. This module can capture the unique features of different organs by adaptively adjusting the receptive field according to various targets. Secondly, we utilize ARFM as building blocks to construct the encoder-decoder of SACNet and partially share parameters between the encoder and decoder, making the network wider rather than deeper. This design achieves a shared lightweight decoder and a more parameter-efficient and effective framework. Lastly, we propose a novel continuity dynamic adjustment loss function, based on t-vMF dice loss and cross-entropy loss, to better balance easy and complex classes in segmentation.

While state-space networks, including Mamba, a revolutionary advancement in recurrent neural networks, typically scan input sequences from left to right, they face difficulties in designing effective scanning strategies, especially in the processing of image data. Our method demonstrates that integrating wavelet transformation into Mamba enhances the local structure awareness of visual inputs and better captures long-range relations of frequencies by disentangling them into wavelet subbands, representing both low- and high-frequency components. These wavelet-based outputs are then processed and seamlessly fused with the original Mamba outputs through a cross-attention fusion layer, combining both spatial and frequency information to optimize the order awareness of state-space models which is essential for the details and overall quality of image generation. Besides, we introduce a globally-shared transformer to supercharge the performance of Mamba, harnessing its exceptional power to capture global relationships. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, our method demonstrates superior results compared to DiT and DIFFUSSM, achieving faster training convergence and delivering high-quality outputs. The codes and pretrained models are released at https://github.com/VinAIResearch/DiMSUM.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024.

Current approaches relying on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) combined with artificial-intelligence-aided (AI) signal processing have drawbacks of being power-hungry and requiring wide bandwidth that raise scalability concerns. In this article, we take a radical approach and utilize the channel fading phenomenon to our advantage. Specifically, we propose a novel meta-fluid antenna architecture, referred to as the `fluid' antenna system (FAS), that can freely surf on radio wave fluctuations, like `fluid' figuratively speaking, with fine resolution in space to opportunistically avoid interference, eliminating the need for expensive signal processing. Our experimental results demonstrate that under rich scattering conditions, the proposed meta-fluidic architecture is able to exploit the natural ups and downs of radio waves in space for spatial multiplexing. These breakthrough results show that scattering can be desirable not harmful and interference can be dodged not suppressed, fundamentally changing our perception of fading and our understanding on how interference should be managed in wireless communications networks.</p></details> |  |

In the mainstream modeling strategies, i.e., CNN and Transformer, the input images are treated as the equal-sized grid of pixels in the Euclidean space. They have limitations in facing remote sensing images with irregular ground objects. Graph is the more flexible structure, however, there are two major challenges when modeling spatial-spectral properties with graph: \emph{1) constructing the customized graph structure for spatial-spectral relationship priors}; \emph{2) learning the unified spatial-spectral representation through the graph}. To address these challenges, we propose the spatial-spectral heterogeneous graph learning network, named \textbf{HetSSNet}. Specifically, HetSSNet initially constructs the heterogeneous graph structure for pansharpening, which explicitly describes pansharpening-specific relationships. Subsequently, the basic relationship pattern generation module is designed to extract the multiple relationship patterns from the heterogeneous graph. Finally, relationship pattern aggregation module is exploited to collaboratively learn unified spatial-spectral representation across different relationships among nodes with adaptive importance learning from local and global perspectives. Extensive experiments demonstrate the significant superiority and generalization of HetSSNet.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we rethink this challenging task setting with the layout among instances and present Point2RBox-v2. At the core are three principles: 1) Gaussian overlap loss. It learns an upper bound for each instance by treating objects as 2D Gaussian distributions and minimizing their overlap. 2) Voronoi watershed loss. It learns a lower bound for each instance through watershed on Voronoi tessellation. 3) Consistency loss. It learns the size/rotation variation between two output sets with respect to an input image and its augmented view. Supplemented by a few devised techniques, e.g. edge loss and copy-paste, the detector is further enhanced. To our best knowledge, Point2RBox-v2 is the first approach to explore the spatial layout among instances for learning point-supervised OOD. Our solution is elegant and lightweight, yet it is expected to give a competitive performance especially in densely packed scenes: 62.61%/86.15%/34.71% on DOTA/HRSC/FAIR1M.

While web-based visual storytelling is well-established, leveraging the next generation of digital technologies for visual storytelling, specifically immersive technologies, remains underexplored. We investigated the impact of the story viewpoint (from the audience's perspective) and navigation (when progressing through the story) on spatial immersion and understanding. First, we collected web-based 3D stories and elicited design considerations from three VR developers. We then adapted four selected web-based stories to an immersive format. Finally, we conducted a user study (N=24) to examine egocentric and exocentric viewpoints, active and passive navigation, and the combinations they form. Our results indicated significantly higher preferences for egocentric+active (higher agency and engagement) and exocentric+passive (higher focus on content). We also found a marginal significance of viewpoints on story understanding and a strong significance of navigation on spatial immersion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Network Calculus: Toward Deterministic Wireless Networking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02556v3)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper extends the classical network calculus to spatial scenarios, focusing on wireless networks with heterogeneous traffic and varying transmit power levels. Building on spatial network calculus, a prior extension of network calculus to spatial settings, we propose a generalized framework by introducing spatial regulations for stationary marked point processes. The regulations correspond to two key constraints: the total transmit power within a spatial region and the cumulative received power at a receiver. Then we prove the equivalence of ball regulation and shot-noise regulation for stationary marked point processes and establish a universal lower bound on the performance of all network links under these constraints. This framework is applicable to diverse network scenarios, as demonstrated by the analysis of performance guarantees for networks with multi-class users. In addition, we propose an SINR-based power control scheme adapted to user traffic, which ensures differentiated quality of service (QoS) for different user classes. We derive deterministic performance guarantees for all links in complex and heterogeneous wireless networks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

The complexity stems from the intricate interplay between spatial proximity and temporal relevance, where both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations are present in convoluted patterns. Existing approaches, including traditional statistical methods and conventional neural networks, may provide inaccurate results due to the lack of an effective mechanism that simultaneously incorporates information at variable temporal depths while maintaining spatial context, resulting in a trade-off between comprehensive long-term historical analysis and responsiveness to short-term new information. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN) with bidirectional depth modulation that enables a comprehensive understanding of both long-term seasonality and short-term fluctuations, adapting to the complex ST context. Case studies with real-world public data demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy, with a 12% reduction in Mean Squared Error for urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in rain precipitation forecasting compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, without demanding extra computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to Applied Intelligence for review</p></details> |
| **[High-Rate Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes Based on Massey's Convolutional Self-Orthogonal Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03774v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study a new class of high-rate spatially coupled LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes based on the convolutional self-orthogonal codes (CSOCs) first introduced by Massey. The SC-LDPC codes are constructed by treating the irregular graph corresponding to the parity-check matrix of a systematic rate R = (n - 1)/n CSOC as a convolutional protograph. The protograph can then be lifted using permutation matrices to generate a high-rate SC-LDPC code whose strength depends on the lifting factor. The SC-LDPC codes constructed in this fashion can be decoded using iterative belief propagation (BP) based sliding window decoding (SWD). A non-systematic version of a CSOC parity-check matrix is then proposed by making a slight modification to the systematic construction. The non-systematic parity-check matrix corresponds to a regular protograph whose degree profile depends on the rate and error-correcting capability of the underlying CSOC. Even though the parity-check matrix is in non-systematic form, we show how systematic encoding can still be performed. We also show that the non-systematic convolutional protograph has a guaranteed girth and free distance and that these properties carry over to the lifted versions. Finally, numerical results are included demonstrating that CSOC-based SC-LDPC codes (i) achieve excellent performance at very high rates, (ii) have performance at least as good as that of SC-LDPC codes constructed from convolutional protographs commonly found in the literature, and (iii) have iterative decoding thresholds comparable to those of existing SC-LDPC code designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting Future States with Spatial Point Processes in Single Molecule Resolution Spatial Transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02564v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a pipeline based on XGboost to predict the future distribution of cells that are expressed by the Sog-D gene (active cells) in both the Anterior to posterior (AP) and the Dorsal to Ventral (DV) axis of the Drosophila in embryogenesis process. This method provides insights about how cells and living organisms control gene expression in super resolution whole embryo spatial transcriptomics imaging at sub cellular, single molecule resolution. An XGboost model was used to predict the next stage active distribution based on the previous one. To achieve this goal, we leveraged temporally resolved, spatial point processes by including Ripley's K-function in conjunction with the cell's state in each stage of embryogenesis, and found average predictive accuracy of active cell distribution. This tool is analogous to RNA Velocity for spatially resolved developmental biology, from one data point we can predict future spatially resolved gene expression using features from the spatial point processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEM: Spatial-Temporal Mapping Tool For Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03287v1)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising bio-inspired third-generation neural networks. Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration tool for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 23 figures, under review at IEEE TC</p></details> |

To help overcome these limitations, we introduce iVISPAR, an interactive multi-modal benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs acting as agents. iVISPAR is based on a variant of the sliding tile puzzle-a classic problem that demands logical planning, spatial awareness, and multi-step reasoning. The benchmark supports visual 2D, 3D, and text-based input modalities, enabling comprehensive assessments of VLMs' planning and reasoning skills. We evaluate a broad suite of state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source VLMs, comparing their performance while also providing optimal path solutions and a human baseline to assess the task's complexity and feasibility for humans. Results indicate that while some VLMs perform well on simple spatial tasks, they encounter difficulties with more complex configurations and problem properties. Notably, while VLMs generally perform better in 2D vision compared to 3D or text-based representations, they consistently fall short of human performance, illustrating the persistent challenge of visual alignment. This highlights critical gaps in current VLM capabilities, highlighting their limitations in achieving human-level cognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Distillation for Takeaway Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16502v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The takeaway recommendation system aims to recommend users' future takeaway purchases based on their historical purchase behaviors, thereby improving user satisfaction and boosting merchant sales. Existing methods focus on incorporating auxiliary information or leveraging knowledge graphs to alleviate the sparsity issue of user purchase sequences. However, two main challenges limit the performance of these approaches: (1) capturing dynamic user preferences on complex geospatial information and (2) efficiently integrating spatial-temporal knowledge from both graphs and sequence data with low computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal knowledge distillation model for takeaway recommendation (STKDRec) based on the two-stage training process. Specifically, during the first pre-training stage, a spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) encoder is trained to extract high-order spatial-temporal dependencies and collaborative associations from the STKG. During the second spatial-temporal knowledge distillation (STKD) stage, a spatial-temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer) is employed to comprehensively model dynamic user preferences on various types of fine-grained geospatial information from a sequential perspective. Furthermore, the STKD strategy is introduced to transfer graph-based spatial-temporal knowledge to the ST-Transformer, facilitating the adaptive fusion of rich knowledge derived from both the STKG and sequence data while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that STKDRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

We fairly compare different analog-to-digital converter (ADC) parametrizations by keeping the ADC power consumption constant. Here, 1-, 2-, and 3-bit quantization is investigated with different oversampling factors. We analytically compute the statistics of the detection variable, and we propose the optimal and several suboptimal detection schemes for arbitrary quantization resolutions. Then, we evaluate the symbol error rate (SER) of the different detectors for 16- and 64-ary quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). The results indicate that there is a noticeable performance degradation of the suboptimal detectors compared to the optimal detector when the constellation size is larger than the number of quantization levels. Furthermore, at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), 1-bit quantization outperforms 2- and 3-bit quantization, respectively, even when employing higher-order constellations. We confirm our analytical results by Monte Carlo simulations. Both a pure line-of-sight (LoS) and a more realistically modeled indoor THz channel are considered. Then, we optimize the input signal constellation with respect to SER for 1- and 2-bit quantization. The results give insights for optimizing higher-order constellations for arbitrary quantization resolutions and show that the minimum SER can be lowered significantly by appropriately placing the constellation points.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 17 figures, published in IEEE Access</p></details> |

In this work, we show that such a corresponding region pair can be predicted by the same language prompt on two different images using the pre-trained large multimodal models based on GroundingDINO and SAM. This enables a fully automated and training-free registration algorithm, potentially generalisable to a wide range of image registration tasks. In this paper, we present experimental results using one of the challenging tasks, registering inter-subject prostate MR images, which involves both highly variable intensity and morphology between patients. Tell2Reg is training-free, eliminating the need for costly and time-consuming data curation and labelling that was previously required for this registration task. This approach outperforms unsupervised learning-based registration methods tested, and has a performance comparable to weakly-supervised methods. Additional qualitative results are also presented to suggest that, for the first time, there is a potential correlation between language semantics and spatial correspondence, including the spatial invariance in language-prompted regions and the difference in language prompts between the obtained local and global correspondences.

Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors</p></details> |
| **[FSTA-SNN:Frequency-based Spatial-Temporal Attention Module for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14744v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are emerging as a promising alternative to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) due to their inherent energy efficiency. Owing to the inherent sparsity in spike generation within SNNs, the in-depth analysis and optimization of intermediate output spikes are often neglected. This oversight significantly restricts the inherent energy efficiency of SNNs and diminishes their advantages in spatiotemporal feature extraction, resulting in a lack of accuracy and unnecessary energy expenditure. In this work, we analyze the inherent spiking characteristics of SNNs from both temporal and spatial perspectives. In terms of spatial analysis, we find that shallow layers tend to focus on learning vertical variations, while deeper layers gradually learn horizontal variations of features. Regarding temporal analysis, we observe that there is not a significant difference in feature learning across different time steps. This suggests that increasing the time steps has limited effect on feature learning. Based on the insights derived from these analyses, we propose a Frequency-based Spatial-Temporal Attention (FSTA) module to enhance feature learning in SNNs. This module aims to improve the feature learning capabilities by suppressing redundant spike features.The experimental results indicate that the introduction of the FSTA module significantly reduces the spike firing rate of SNNs, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: 1. Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and 2. Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results.</p></details> | 34 pages, 18 Figures |

To reduce the dimensionality of the predictor variables, we apply the sufficient dimension reduction (SDR) paradigm, which reduces the predictor space while retaining relevant information about the response. To achieve this, we impose two different spatial models on the inverse regression: the separable spatial covariance model (SSCM) and the spatial autoregressive error model (SEM). For these models, we derive maximum likelihood estimators for the reduction and use them to predict the response via nonparametric rules for forward regression. Through simulations and real data applications, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for spatial data prediction.</p></details> |  |

The current analysis works use image captioning tasks and visual question answering. In this work, we propose using the Referring Expression Comprehension task instead as a platform for the evaluation of spatial reasoning by VLMs. This platform provides the opportunity for a deeper analysis of spatial comprehension and grounding abilities when there is 1) ambiguity in object detection, 2) complex spatial expressions with a longer sentence structure and multiple spatial relations, and 3) expressions with negation ('not'). In our analysis, we use task-specific architectures as well as large VLMs and highlight their strengths and weaknesses in dealing with these specific situations. While all these models face challenges with the task at hand, the relative behaviors depend on the underlying models and the specific categories of spatial semantics (topological, directional, proximal, etc.). Our results highlight these challenges and behaviors and provide insight into research gaps and future directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Structure Learning for Tumor Microenvironment with Cell Type Annotation from non-spatial scRNA-seq data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02629v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The exploration of cellular heterogeneity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) via single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) is essential for understanding cancer progression and response to therapy. Current scRNA-seq approaches, however, lack spatial context and rely on incomplete datasets of ligand-receptor interactions (LRIs), limiting accurate cell type annotation and cell-cell communication (CCC) inference. This study addresses these challenges using a novel graph neural network (GNN) model that enhances cell type prediction and cell interaction analysis. Our study utilized a dataset consisting of 49,020 cells from 19 patients across three cancer types: Leukemia, Breast Invasive Carcinoma, and Colorectal Cancer. The proposed scGSL model demonstrated robust performance, achieving an average accuracy of 84.83%, precision of 86.23%, recall of 81.51%, and an F1 score of 80.92% across all datasets. These metrics represent a significant enhancement over existing methods, which typically exhibit lower performance metrics. Additionally, by reviewing existing literature on gene interactions within the TME, the scGSL model proves to robustly identify biologically meaningful gene interactions in an unsupervised manner, validated by significant expression differences in key gene pairs across various cancers. The source code and data used in this paper can be found in https://github.com/LiYuechao1998/scGSL.</p></details> | 29 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Unified Spatial-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02504v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Transformer Captures Spatial-Temporal Dependencies: A Theory for Gaussian Process Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16134v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer, the backbone of Sora for video generation, successfully scales the capacity of diffusion models, pioneering new avenues for high-fidelity sequential data generation. Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |

In this paper, we propose an improved fabric defect detection model based on YOLOv11. To enhance the detection of strip defects, we introduce a Strip Perception Module (SPM) that improves feature capture through multi-scale convolution. We further enhance the spatial pyramid pooling fast (SPPF) by integrating a squeeze-and-excitation mechanism, resulting in the SE-SPPF module, which better integrates spatial and channel information for more effective defect feature extraction. Additionally, we propose a novel focal enhanced complete intersection over union (FECIoU) metric with adaptive weights, addressing scale differences and class imbalance by adjusting the weights of hard-to-detect instances through focal loss. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves a 0.8-8.1% improvement in mean average precision (mAP) on the Tianchi dataset and a 1.6-13.2% improvement on our custom dataset, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Texture Image Synthesis Using Spatial GAN Based on Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01842v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Texture synthesis is a fundamental task in computer vision, whose goal is to generate visually realistic and structurally coherent textures for a wide range of applications, from graphics to scientific simulations. While traditional methods like tiling and patch-based techniques often struggle with complex textures, recent advancements in deep learning have transformed this field. In this paper, we propose ViT-SGAN, a new hybrid model that fuses Vision Transformers (ViTs) with a Spatial Generative Adversarial Network (SGAN) to address the limitations of previous methods. By incorporating specialized texture descriptors such as mean-variance (mu, sigma) and textons into the self-attention mechanism of ViTs, our model achieves superior texture synthesis. This approach enhances the model's capacity to capture complex spatial dependencies, leading to improved texture quality that is superior to state-of-the-art models, especially for regular and irregular textures. Comparison experiments with metrics such as FID, IS, SSIM, and LPIPS demonstrate the substantial improvement of ViT-SGAN, which underlines its efficiency in generating diverse realistic textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Software Engineering (AI-SOFT), Shiraz University, Shiraz, Iran, 2024</p></details> |
| **[TESS: A Scalable Temporally and Spatially Local Learning Rule for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01837v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for low-power inference and training of deep neural networks (DNNs) on edge devices has intensified the need for algorithms that are both scalable and energy-efficient. While spiking neural networks (SNNs) allow for efficient inference by processing complex spatio-temporal dynamics in an event-driven fashion, training them on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of conventional error backpropagation (BP)-based approaches. In this work, we draw inspiration from biological mechanisms such as eligibility traces, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and neural activity synchronization to introduce TESS, a temporally and spatially local learning rule for training SNNs. Our approach addresses both temporal and spatial credit assignments by relying solely on locally available signals within each neuron, thereby allowing computational and memory overheads to scale linearly with the number of neurons, independently of the number of time steps. Despite relying on local mechanisms, we demonstrate performance comparable to the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, within $\sim1.4$ accuracy points on challenging computer vision scenarios relevant at the edge, such as the IBM DVS Gesture dataset, CIFAR10-DVS, and temporal versions of CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Being able to produce comparable performance to BPTT while keeping low time and memory complexity, TESS enables efficient and scalable on-device learning at the edge.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Scalable 3D Gaussian Splatting-Based RF Signal Spatial Propagation Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01826v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective network planning and sensing in wireless networks require resource-intensive site surveys for data collection. An alternative is Radio-Frequency (RF) signal spatial propagation modeling, which computes received signals given transceiver positions in a scene (e.g.s a conference room). We identify a fundamental trade-off between scalability and fidelity in the state-of-the-art method. To address this issue, we explore leveraging 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), an advanced technique for the image synthesis of 3D scenes in real-time from arbitrary camera poses. By integrating domain-specific insights, we design three components for adapting 3DGS to the RF domain, including Gaussian-based RF scene representation, gradient-guided RF attribute learning, and RF-customized CUDA for ray tracing. Building on them, we develop RFSPM, an end-to-end framework for scalable RF signal Spatial Propagation Modeling. We evaluate RFSPM in four field studies and two applications across RFID, BLE, LoRa, and 5G, covering diverse frequencies, antennas, signals, and scenes. The results show that RFSPM matches the fidelity of the state-of-the-art method while reducing data requirements, training GPU-hours, and inference latency by up to 9.8\,$\times$, 18.6\,$\times$, and 84.4\,$\times$, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Home Range and Intra-Specific Spatial Interaction in Wild Animal Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01694v2)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactions among individuals from the same-species of wild animals are an important component of population dynamics. An interaction can be either static (based on overlap of space use) or dynamic (based on movement). The goal of this work is to determine the level of static interactions between individuals from the same-species of wild animals using 95\% and 50\% home ranges, as well as to model their movement interactions, which could include attraction, avoidance (or repulsion), or lack of interaction, in order to gain new insights and improve our understanding of ecological processes. Home range estimation methods (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, and autocorrelated kernel density estimator), inhomogeneous multitype (or cross-type) summary statistics, and envelope testing methods (pointwise and global envelope tests) were proposed to study the nature of the same-species wild-animal spatial interactions. This study provides comprehensive, self-contained methodological details for investigating spatial interactions between individuals of the same species in wildlife populations. Using GPS collar data, we applied the methods to quantify both static and dynamic interactions between black bears in southern Alabama, USA. In general, our findings suggest that the black bears in our dataset showed no significant preference to live together or apart, i.e., there was no significant deviation from independence toward association or avoidance (i.e., segregation) between the bears. This can be loosely interpreted to mean that a black bear is generally indifferent to the presence of other black bears living or wandering nearby.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse VideoGen: Accelerating Video Diffusion Transformers with Spatial-Temporal Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01776v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) dominate video generation but their high computational cost severely limits real-world applicability, usually requiring tens of minutes to generate a few seconds of video even on high-performance GPUs. This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

These approaches create a 3D radiance field, parameterized by per-pixel 3D Gaussian primitives, from just a few images in a single forward pass. However, unlike multi-view methods that benefit from cross-view correspondences, 3D scene reconstruction with a single-view image remains an underexplored area. In this work, we introduce CATSplat, a novel generalizable transformer-based framework designed to break through the inherent constraints in monocular settings. First, we propose leveraging textual guidance from a visual-language model to complement insufficient information from a single image. By incorporating scene-specific contextual details from text embeddings through cross-attention, we pave the way for context-aware 3D scene reconstruction beyond relying solely on visual cues. Moreover, we advocate utilizing spatial guidance from 3D point features toward comprehensive geometric understanding under single-view settings. With 3D priors, image features can capture rich structural insights for predicting 3D Gaussians without multi-view techniques. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CATSplat in single-view 3D scene reconstruction with high-quality novel view synthesis.</p></details> |  |

However, how such structure affects the vulnerability against malicious attacks remains unclear. This study investigates the impact of local communities on the robustness of connectivity by modeling planar infrastructure networks based on statistical population data. Our research reveals that the emergence of local communities is caused by spatial concentrations of nodes connected by short links, which significantly reduce the robustness. These results suggest that strategically establishing long distance links provides a feasible solution to balance reliability and construction costs in infrastructure network design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified from the first version</p></details> |
| **[V2I-Calib++: A Multi-terminal Spatial Calibration Approach in Urban Intersections for Collaborative Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11008v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban intersections, dense with pedestrian and vehicular traffic and compounded by GPS signal obstructions from high-rise buildings, are among the most challenging areas in urban traffic systems. Traditional single-vehicle intelligence systems often perform poorly in such environments due to a lack of global traffic flow information and the ability to respond to unexpected events. Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology, through real-time communication between vehicles (V2V) and vehicles to infrastructure (V2I), offers a robust solution. However, practical applications still face numerous challenges. Calibration among heterogeneous vehicle and infrastructure endpoints in multi-end LiDAR systems is crucial for ensuring the accuracy and consistency of perception system data. Most existing multi-end calibration methods rely on initial calibration values provided by positioning systems, but the instability of GPS signals due to high buildings in urban canyons poses severe challenges to these methods. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-end LiDAR system calibration method that does not require positioning priors to determine initial external parameters and meets real-time requirements. Our method introduces an innovative multi-end perception object association technique, utilizing a new Overall Distance metric (oDist) to measure the spatial association between perception objects, and effectively combines global consistency search algorithms with optimal transport theory. By this means, we can extract co-observed targets from object association results for further external parameter computation and optimization. Extensive comparative and ablation experiments conducted on the simulated dataset V2X-Sim and the real dataset DAIR-V2X confirm the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. The code for this method can be accessed at: https://github.com/MassimoQu/v2i-calib.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Spatial Hybrid User Interface for Visual Sensemaking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00853v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We built a spatial hybrid system that combines a personal computer (PC) and virtual reality (VR) for visual sensemaking, addressing limitations in both environments. Although VR offers immense potential for interactive data visualization (e.g., large display space and spatial navigation), it can also present challenges such as imprecise interactions and user fatigue. At the same time, a PC offers precise and familiar interactions but has limited display space and interaction modality. Therefore, we iteratively designed a spatial hybrid system (PC+VR) to complement these two environments by enabling seamless switching between PC and VR environments. To evaluate the system's effectiveness and user experience, we compared it to using a single computing environment (i.e., PC-only and VR-only). Our study results (N=18) showed that spatial PC+VR could combine the benefits of both devices to outperform user preference for VR-only without a negative impact on performance from device switching overhead. Finally, we discussed future design implications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TVCG</p></details> |
| **[S2CFormer: Reorienting Learned Image Compression from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00700v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have achieved significant success in learned image compression (LIC), with Swin Transformers emerging as the mainstream choice for nonlinear transforms. A common belief is that their sophisticated spatial operations contribute most to their efficacy. However, the crucial role of the feed-forward network (FFN) based Channel Aggregation module within the transformer architecture has been largely overlooked, and the over-design of spatial operations leads to a suboptimal trade-off between decoding latency and R-D performance. In this paper, we reevaluate the key factors behind the competence of transformers in LIC. By replacing spatial operations with identity mapping, we are surprised to find that channel operations alone can approach the R-D performance of the leading methods. This solid lower bound of performance emphasizes that the presence of channel aggregation is more essential for the LIC model to achieve competitive performance, while the previously complex spatial interactions are partly redundant. Based on this insight, we initiate the "S2CFormer" paradigm, a general architecture that reorients the focus of LIC from Spatial Interaction to Channel Aggregation. We present two instantiations of the S2CFormer: S2C-Conv, and S2C-Attention. Each one incorporates a simple operator for spatial interaction and serves as nonlinear transform blocks for our LIC models. Both models demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) R-D performance and significantly faster decoding speed. These results also motivate further exploration of advanced FFN structures to enhance the R-D performance while maintaining model efficiency. With these foundations, we introduce S2C-Hybrid, an enhanced LIC model that combines the strengths of different S2CFormer instantiations. This model outperforms all the existing methods on several datasets, setting a new benchmark for efficient and high-performance LIC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information Bottleneck Approach to Spatial Attention Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03418v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The selective visual attention mechanism in the human visual system (HVS) restricts the amount of information to reach visual awareness for perceiving natural scenes, allowing near real-time information processing with limited computational capacity [Koch and Ullman, 1987]. This kind of selectivity acts as an 'Information Bottleneck (IB)', which seeks a trade-off between information compression and predictive accuracy. However, such information constraints are rarely explored in the attention mechanism for deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose an IB-inspired spatial attention module for DNN structures built for visual recognition. The module takes as input an intermediate representation of the input image, and outputs a variational 2D attention map that minimizes the mutual information (MI) between the attention-modulated representation and the input, while maximizing the MI between the attention-modulated representation and the task label. To further restrict the information bypassed by the attention map, we quantize the continuous attention scores to a set of learnable anchor values during training. Extensive experiments show that the proposed IB-inspired spatial attention mechanism can yield attention maps that neatly highlight the regions of interest while suppressing backgrounds, and bootstrap standard DNN structures for visual recognition tasks (e.g., image classification, fine-grained recognition, cross-domain classification). The attention maps are interpretable for the decision making of the DNNs as verified in the experiments.

To address this challenge, a recently proposed Bayesian transport map (BTM) approach consists of a triangular transport map with nonparametric Gaussian-process (GP) components, which is trained to transform the distribution of interest distribution to a Gaussian reference distribution. To improve the performance of this existing BTM, we propose to shrink the map components toward a ``base'' parametric Gaussian family combined with a Vecchia approximation for scalability. The resulting ShrinkTM approach is more accurate than the existing BTM, especially for small numbers of training samples. It can even outperform the ``base'' family when trained on a single sample of the spatial field. We demonstrate the advantage of ShrinkTM though numerical experiments on simulated data and on climate-model output.</p></details> |  |

| **[Generic Multimodal Spatially Graph Network for Spatially Embedded Network Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00530v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially embedded networks (SENs) represent a special type of complex graph, whose topologies are constrained by the networks' embedded spatial environments. The graph representation of such networks is thereby influenced by the embedded spatial features of both nodes and edges. Accurate network representation of the graph structure and graph features is a fundamental task for various graph-related tasks. In this study, a Generic Multimodal Spatially Graph Convolutional Network (GMu-SGCN) is developed for efficient representation of spatially embedded networks. The developed GMu-SGCN model has the ability to learn the node connection pattern via multimodal node and edge features. In order to evaluate the developed model, a river network dataset and a power network dataset have been used as test beds. The river network represents the naturally developed SENs, whereas the power network represents a man-made network. Both types of networks are heavily constrained by the spatial environments and uncertainties from nature. Comprehensive evaluation analysis shows the developed GMu-SGCN can improve accuracy of the edge existence prediction task by 37.1\% compared to a GraphSAGE model which only considers the node's position feature in a power network test bed. Our model demonstrates the importance of considering the multidimensional spatial feature for spatially embedded network representation.</p></details> |  |

Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

While existing works did preliminary studies of generating holistic co-speech gesture from speech, the spatial interaction of each body region during the speech remains barely explored. This leads to wield body part interactions given the speech signal. Furthermore, the slow generation speed limits the construction of real-world digital avatars. To resolve these problems, we propose \textbf{GestureLSM}, a Latent Shortcut based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. We tokenize various body regions and explicitly model their interactions with spatial and temporal attention. To achieve real-time gesture generations, we exam the denoising patterns and design an effective time distribution to speed up sampling while improve the generation quality for shortcut model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GestureLSM, showcasing its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.

However, such fine-tuning relies heavily on high-quality datasets to achieve successful performance in various downstream tasks. Additionally, VLMs often encounter limitations due to insufficient and imbalanced fine-tuning data. To address these issues, we propose a new generalizable framework to improve VLM fine-tuning by integrating it with a reinforcement learning (RL) agent. Our method utilizes the RL agent to manipulate objects within an indoor setting to create synthetic data for fine-tuning to address certain vulnerabilities of the VLM. Specifically, we use the performance of the VLM to provide feedback to the RL agent to generate informative data that efficiently fine-tune the VLM over the targeted task (e.g. spatial reasoning). The key contribution of this work is developing a framework where the RL agent serves as an informative data sampling tool and assists the VLM in order to enhance performance and address task-specific vulnerabilities. By targeting the data sampling process to address the weaknesses of the VLM, we can effectively train a more context-aware model. In addition, generating synthetic data allows us to have precise control over each scene and generate granular ground truth captions. Our results show that the proposed data generation approach improves the spatial reasoning performance of VLMs, which demonstrates the benefits of using RL-guided data generation in vision-language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCPS...</summary><p>ICCPS 2025 accepted paper, 10 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |

Specifically, we introduce Ego3D Position Encoding to inject 3D information into the input observations of the visual-language-action model, and propose Adaptive Action Grids to represent spatial robot movement actions with adaptive discretized action grids, facilitating learning generalizable and transferrable spatial action knowledge for cross-robot control. SpatialVLA is first pre-trained on top of a vision-language model with 1.1 Million real-world robot episodes, to learn a generalist manipulation policy across multiple robot environments and tasks. After pre-training, SpatialVLA is directly applied to perform numerous tasks in a zero-shot manner. The superior results in both simulation and real-world robots demonstrate its advantage of inferring complex robot motion trajectories and its strong in-domain multi-task generalization ability. We further show the proposed Adaptive Action Grids offer a new and effective way to fine-tune the pre-trained SpatialVLA model for new simulation and real-world setups, where the pre-learned action grids are re-discretized to capture robot-specific spatial action movements of new setups. The superior results from extensive evaluations demonstrate the exceptional in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution adaptation capability, highlighting the crucial benefit of the proposed spatial-aware representations for generalist robot policy learning.

| **[Integrating Spatial and Frequency Information for Under-Display Camera Image Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18517v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Under-Display Camera (UDC) houses a digital camera lens under a display panel. However, UDC introduces complex degradations such as noise, blur, decrease in transmittance, and flare. Despite the remarkable progress, previous research on UDC mainly focuses on eliminating diffraction in the spatial domain and rarely explores its potential in the frequency domain. It is essential to consider both the spatial and frequency domains effectively. For example, degradations, such as noise and blur, can be addressed by local information (e.g., CNN kernels in the spatial domain). At the same time, tackling flares may require leveraging global information (e.g., the frequency domain). In this paper, we revisit the UDC degradations in the Fourier space and figure out intrinsic frequency priors that imply the presence of the flares. Based on this observation, we propose a novel multi-level DNN architecture called SFIM. It efficiently restores UDC-distorted images by integrating local and global (the collective contribution of all points in the image) information. The architecture exploits CNNs to capture local information and FFT-based models to capture global information. SFIM comprises a spatial domain block (SDB), a Frequency Domain Block (FDB), and an Attention-based Multi-level Integration Block (AMIB). Specifically, SDB focuses more on detailed textures such as noise and blur, FDB emphasizes irregular texture loss in extensive areas such as flare, and AMIB enables effective cross-domain interaction. SFIM's superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches is demonstrated through rigorous quantitative and qualitative assessments across three UDC benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main body (10 pages, 9 Figures, 5 Tables), References (3 pages), Appendix (8 pages, 6 Figures, 6 Tables)</p></details> |

Real-world measurements of such processes are often collected at irregularly distributed points in space, which can be effectively represented as graphs; however, there are currently only a few existing datasets. Our work aims to make advancements in the field of PDE-modeling accessible to the temporal graph machine learning community, while addressing the data scarcity problem, by creating and utilizing datasets based on PDEs. In this work, we create and use synthetic datasets based on PDEs to support spatio-temporal graph modeling in machine learning for different applications. More precisely, we showcase three equations to model different types of disasters and hazards in the fields of epidemiology, atmospheric particles, and tsunami waves. Further, we show how such created datasets can be used by benchmarking several machine learning models on the epidemiological dataset. Additionally, we show how pre-training on this dataset can improve model performance on real-world epidemiological data. The presented methods enable others to create datasets and benchmarks customized to individual requirements.

In particular, ride-hailing vehicles can effectively facilitate flexible data collection and contribute towards urban intelligence, despite resource limitations. Therefore, this work explores a promising scenario, where edge-assisted vehicles perform joint tasks of order serving and the emerging foundation model fine-tuning using various urban data. However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

This task is however challenging due to multiple sign variations, complexity in language and inherent richness of expressions. Computational approaches have evidenced capabilities to support SLT. Nonetheless, these approaches remain limited to cover gestures variability and support long sequence translations. This paper introduces a Transformer-based architecture that encodes spatio-temporal motion gestures, preserving both local and long-range spatial information through the use of multiple convolutional and attention mechanisms. The proposed approach was validated on the Colombian Sign Language Translation Dataset (CoL-SLTD) outperforming baseline approaches, and achieving a BLEU4 of 46.84%. Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T), achieving a BLEU4 score of 30.77%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world variations</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

The dataset comprises 1,000 videos, featuring 85,000 multiple-choice QA pairs, 2,300 object captioning, and 5,700 object grounding annotations, encompassing diverse real-world conditions such as adverse weather and traffic anomalies. By incorporating tuple-based spatio-temporal object expressions, TUMTraffic-VideoQA unifies three essential tasks-multiple-choice video question answering, referred object captioning, and spatio-temporal object grounding-within a cohesive evaluation framework. We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems.

| **[Automated Extraction of Spatio-Semantic Graphs for Identifying Cognitive Impairment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01685v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing methods for analyzing linguistic content from picture descriptions for assessment of cognitive-linguistic impairment often overlook the participant's visual narrative path, which typically requires eye tracking to assess. Spatio-semantic graphs are a useful tool for analyzing this narrative path from transcripts alone, however they are limited by the need for manual tagging of content information units (CIUs). In this paper, we propose an automated approach for estimation of spatio-semantic graphs (via automated extraction of CIUs) from the Cookie Theft picture commonly used in cognitive-linguistic analyses. The method enables the automatic characterization of the visual semantic path during picture description. Experiments demonstrate that the automatic spatio-semantic graphs effectively differentiate between cognitively impaired and unimpaired speakers. Statistical analyses reveal that the features derived by the automated method produce comparable results to the manual method, with even greater group differences between clinical groups of interest. These results highlight the potential of the automated approach for extracting spatio-semantic features in developing clinical speech models for cognitive impairment assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICASSP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Intrinsic Random Functions and Parametric Covariance Models of Spatio-Temporal Random Processes on the Sphere](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00579v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying an appropriate covariance function is one of the primary interests in spatial and spatio-temporal statistics because it allows researchers to analyze the dependence structure of the random process. For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Deep Spatio-Temporal Architecture for Dynamic Effective Connectivity Network Analysis Based on Dynamic Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18859v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic effective connectivity networks (dECNs) reveal the changing directed brain activity and the dynamic causal influences among brain regions, which facilitate the identification of individual differences and enhance the understanding of human brain. Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation for unbiased cross-validation of spatio-temporal models for species distribution modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03480v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Species Distribution Models (SDMs) often suffer from spatial autocorrelation (SAC), leading to biased performance estimates. We tested cross-validation (CV) strategies - random splits, spatial blocking with varied distances, environmental (ENV) clustering, and a novel spatio-temporal method - under two proposed training schemes: LAST FOLD, widely used in spatial CV at the cost of data loss, and RETRAIN, which maximizes data usage but risks reintroducing SAC. LAST FOLD consistently yielded lower errors and stronger correlations. Spatial blocking at an optimal distance (SP 422) and ENV performed best, achieving Spearman and Pearson correlations of 0.485 and 0.548, respectively, although ENV may be unsuitable for long-term forecasts involving major environmental shifts. A spatio-temporal approach yielded modest benefits in our moderately variable dataset, but may excel with stronger temporal changes. These findings highlight the need to align CV approaches with the spatial and temporal structure of SDM data, ensuring rigorous validation and reliable predictive outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16409v1)** | 2025-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirically-parametrized Spatio-Temporal Extended-SIR Model for Combined Dilution and Vaccination Mitigation for Rabies Outbreaks in Wild Jackals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15425v1)** | 2025-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transmission of zoonotic diseases between animals and humans poses an increasing threat. Rabies is a prominent example with various instances globally, facilitated by a surplus of meso-predators (commonly, facultative synanthropic species e.g., golden jackals [Canis aureus, hereafter jackals]) thanks to the abundance of anthropogenic resources leading to dense populations close to human establishments. To mitigate rabies outbreaks and prevent human infections, authorities target the jackal which is the main rabies vector in many regions, through the dissemination of oral vaccines in known jackals' activity centers, as well as opportunistic culling to reduce population density. Because dilution (i.e., culling) is not selective towards sick or un-vaccinated individuals, these two complementary epizootic intervention policies (EIPs) can interfere with each other. Nonetheless, there is only limited examination of the interactive effectiveness of these EIPs and their potential influence on rabies epizootic spread dynamics, highlighting the need to understand these measures and the spread of rabies in wild jackals. In this study, we introduce a novel spatio-temporal extended-SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) model with a graph-based spatial framework for evaluating mitigation efficiency. We implement the model in a case study using a jackal population in northern Israel, and using spatial and movement data collected by Advanced Tracking and Localization of Animals in real-life Systems (ATLAS) telemetry. An agent-based simulation approach allows us to explore various biologically-realistic scenarios, and assess the impact of different EIPs configurations. Our model suggests that under biologically-realistic underlying assumptions and scenarios, the effectiveness of both EIPs is not influenced much by the jackal population size but is sensitive to their dispersal between activity centers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSTSA-GCN: Advancing Skeleton-Based Gesture Recognition with Semantic-Aware Spatio-Temporal Topology Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12086v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for skeleton-based action and gesture recognition, thanks to their ability to model spatial and temporal dependencies in skeleton data. However, existing GCN-based methods face critical limitations: (1) they lack effective spatio-temporal topology modeling that captures dynamic variations in skeletal motion, and (2) they struggle to model multiscale structural relationships beyond local joint connectivity. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Semantic Awareness Graph Convolutional Network (DSTSA-GCN). DSTSA-GCN introduces three key modules: Group Channel-wise Graph Convolution (GC-GC), Group Temporal-wise Graph Convolution (GT-GC), and Multi-Scale Temporal Convolution (MS-TCN). GC-GC and GT-GC operate in parallel to independently model channel-specific and frame-specific correlations, enabling robust topology learning that accounts for temporal variations. Additionally, both modules employ a grouping strategy to adaptively capture multiscale structural relationships. Complementing this, MS-TCN enhances temporal modeling through group-wise temporal convolutions with diverse receptive fields. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSTSA-GCN significantly improves the topology modeling capabilities of GCNs, achieving state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets for gesture and action recognition, including SHREC17 Track, DHG-14\/28, NTU-RGB+D, and NTU-RGB+D-120.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submit to Neurocomputing</p></details> |

In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties for spatio-temporal receptive fields in terms of spatio-temporal derivative operators applied to spatio-temporally smoothed image data under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations. Specifically, the derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. For this purpose, we also fundamentally extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels, and analyze the covariance properties of the resulting affine-normalized derivatives for the affine group as well as for important subgroups thereof. We conclude with a geometric analysis, showing how the derived joint covariance properties make it possible to relate or match spatio-temporal receptive field responses, when observing, possibly moving, local surface patches from different views, under locally linearized perspective or projective transformations, as well as when observing different instances of spatio-temporal events, that may occur either faster or slower between different views of similar spatio-temporal events.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 19 figures.

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Different regions in the area exhibit different characteristics while having latent correlations. This spatial heterogeneity and correlations greatly affect the spatio-temporal distributions of event occurrences, which has not been addressed by state-of-the-art models. Learning spatial dependencies of events in a continuous space is challenging due to its fine granularity and a lack of prior knowledge. In this work, we propose a novel Graph Spatio-Temporal Point Process (GSTPP) model for fine-grained event prediction. It adopts an encoder-decoder architecture that jointly models the state dynamics of spatially localized regions using neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs). The state evolution is built on the foundation of a novel Self-Adaptive Anchor Graph (SAAG) that captures spatial dependencies. By adaptively localizing the anchor nodes in the space and jointly constructing the correlation edges between them, the SAAG enhances the model's ability of learning complex spatial event patterns. The proposed GSTPP model greatly improves the accuracy of fine-grained event prediction. Extensive experimental results show that our method greatly improves the prediction accuracy over existing spatio-temporal event prediction approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIAM International Conference on Data Mining 2025 (SDM'25)</p></details> |

Multi-sensor synchronous measurement has proven to be more effective for WHAR than using a single sensor. However, existing WHAR methods use shared convolutional kernels for indiscriminate temporal feature extraction across each sensor variable, which fails to effectively capture spatio-temporal relationships of intra-sensor and inter-sensor variables. We propose the DecomposeWHAR model consisting of a decomposition phase and a fusion phase to better model the relationships between modality variables. The decomposition creates high-dimensional representations of each intra-sensor variable through the improved Depth Separable Convolution to capture local temporal features while preserving their unique characteristics. The fusion phase begins by capturing relationships between intra-sensor variables and fusing their features at both the channel and variable levels. Long-range temporal dependencies are modeled using the State Space Model (SSM), and later cross-sensor interactions are dynamically captured through a self-attention mechanism, highlighting inter-sensor spatial correlations. Our model demonstrates superior performance on three widely used WHAR datasets, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art models while maintaining acceptable computational efficiency. Our codes and supplementary materials are available at https://github.com/Anakin2555/DecomposeWHAR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Consistent Spatio-Temporal Correspondence for Robust Visual Odometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16923v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to VO have significantly improved performance by using deep networks to predict optical flow between video frames. However, existing methods still suffer from noisy and inconsistent flow matching, making it difficult to handle challenging scenarios and long-sequence estimation. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Spatio-Temporal Visual Odometry (STVO), a novel deep network architecture that effectively leverages inherent spatio-temporal cues to enhance the accuracy and consistency of multi-frame flow matching. With more accurate and consistent flow matching, STVO can achieve better pose estimation through the bundle adjustment (BA). Specifically, STVO introduces two innovative components: 1) the Temporal Propagation Module that utilizes multi-frame information to extract and propagate temporal cues across adjacent frames, maintaining temporal consistency; 2) the Spatial Activation Module that utilizes geometric priors from the depth maps to enhance spatial consistency while filtering out excessive noise and incorrect matches. Our STVO achieves state-of-the-art performance on TUM-RGBD, EuRoc MAV, ETH3D and KITTI Odometry benchmarks. Notably, it improves accuracy by 77.8% on ETH3D benchmark and 38.9% on KITTI Odometry benchmark over the previous best methods.</p></details> |  |

Most recent approaches rely on binary classifiers trained on both real and fake data. However, such methods may struggle to focus on important artifacts, which can hinder their generalization capability. Additionally, these models often lack interpretability, making it difficult to understand how predictions are made. To address these issues, we propose FakeSTormer, offering two key contributions. First, we introduce a multi-task learning framework with additional spatial and temporal branches that enable the model to focus on subtle spatio-temporal artifacts. These branches also provide interpretability by highlighting video regions that may contain artifacts. Second, we propose a video-level data synthesis algorithm that generates pseudo-fake videos with subtle artifacts, providing the model with high-quality samples and ground truth data for our spatial and temporal branches. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks demonstrate the competitiveness of our approach compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.

Concretely, earth science systems rely heavily on the extensive deployment of sensors, however, the data collection from sensors is constrained by complex geographical and social factors, making it challenging to achieve comprehensive coverage and uniform deployment. To alleviate the obstacle, traditional approaches to sensor deployment utilize specific algorithms to design and deploy sensors. These methods \textit{dynamically adjust the activation times of sensors to optimize the detection process across each sub-region}. Regrettably, formulating an activation strategy generally based on historical observations and geographic characteristics, which make the methods and resultant models were neither simple nor practical. Worse still, the complex technical design may ultimately lead to a model with weak generalizability. In this paper, we introduce for the first time the concept of spatio-temporal data dynamic sparse training and are committed to adaptively, dynamically filtering important sensor distributions. To our knowledge, this is the \textbf{first} proposal (\textit{termed DynST}) of an \textbf{industry-level} deployment optimization concept at the data level. However, due to the existence of the temporal dimension, pruning of spatio-temporal data may lead to conflicts at different timestamps. To achieve this goal, we employ dynamic merge technology, along with ingenious dimensional mapping to mitigate potential impacts caused by the temporal aspect. During the training process, DynST utilize iterative pruning and sparse training, repeatedly identifying and dynamically removing sensor perception areas that contribute the least to future predictions.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we explore automated pain detection using facial expressions. Our study leverages deep learning techniques to improve pain assessment by analyzing facial images from the Pain Emotion Faces Database (PEMF). We propose two novel approaches1: (1) a hybrid ConvNeXt model combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) blocks to analyze video frames and predict pain presence, and (2) a Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolution Network (STGCN) integrated with LSTM to process landmarks from facial images for pain detection.

| **[Get Rid of Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v2)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved.

Point processes specified on linear networks can provide a more accurate description of crime incidents by considering the geometry of the city. We propose a spatio-temporal Dirichlet process mixture model on a linear network to analyze crime events in Valencia, Spain. We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with a Dirichlet process prior to automatically detect space-time clusters of the events and adopt a convolution kernel estimator to account for the network structure in the city. From the fitted model, we provide crime hotspot visualizations that can inform social interventions to prevent crime incidents. Furthermore, we study the relationships between the detected cluster centers and the city's amenities, which provides an intuitive explanation of criminal contagion.</p></details> |  |

Recently, we have witnessed the rise of variational autoencoder-based latent factor models, which learn latent factors self-adaptively. While these models focus on modeling overall market conditions, they often fail to effectively capture the temporal patterns of individual stocks. Additionally, representing multiple factors as single values simplifies the model but limits its ability to capture complex relationships and dependencies. As a result, the learned factors are of low quality and lack diversity, reducing their effectiveness and robustness across different trading periods. To address these issues, we propose a Spatio-Temporal factOR Model based on dual vector quantized variational autoencoders, named STORM, which extracts features of stocks from temporal and spatial perspectives, then fuses and aligns these features at the fine-grained and semantic level, and represents the factors as multi-dimensional embeddings. The discrete codebooks cluster similar factor embeddings, ensuring orthogonality and diversity, which helps distinguish between different factors and enables factor selection in financial trading. To show the performance of the proposed factor model, we apply it to two downstream experiments: portfolio management on two stock datasets and individual trading tasks on six specific stocks. The extensive experiments demonstrate STORM's flexibility in adapting to downstream tasks and superior performance over baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Traffic Prediction Through Spatio-Temporal Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10459v1)** | 2025-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph neural networks (GNNs) have gained considerable attention in recent years for traffic flow prediction due to their ability to learn spatio-temporal pattern representations through a graph-based message-passing framework. Although GNNs have shown great promise in handling traffic datasets, their deployment in real-life applications has been hindered by scalability constraints arising from high-order message passing. Additionally, the over-smoothing problem of GNNs may lead to indistinguishable region representations as the number of layers increases, resulting in performance degradation. To address these challenges, we propose a new knowledge distillation paradigm termed LightST that transfers spatial and temporal knowledge from a high-capacity teacher to a lightweight student. Specifically, we introduce a spatio-temporal knowledge distillation framework that helps student MLPs capture graph-structured global spatio-temporal patterns while alleviating the over-smoothing effect with adaptive knowledge distillation. Extensive experiments verify that LightST significantly speeds up traffic flow predictions by 5X to 40X compared to state-of-the-art spatio-temporal GNNs, all while maintaining superior accuracy.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We provide theoretical arguments for the different temporal blocks and use a multitude of tests across different datasets to assess our hypotheses.</p></details> |  |

ANN-to-SNN knowledge distillation can improve SNN performance, but previous methods either focus solely on label information, missing valuable intermediate layer features, or use a layer-wise approach that neglects spatial and temporal semantic inconsistencies, leading to performance degradation.To address these limitations, we propose a novel method called self-attentive spatio-temporal calibration (SASTC). SASTC uses self-attention to identify semantically aligned layer pairs between ANN and SNN, both spatially and temporally. This enables the autonomous transfer of relevant semantic information. Extensive experiments show that SASTC outperforms existing methods, effectively solving the mismatching problem. Superior accuracy results include 95.12% on CIFAR-10, 79.40% on CIFAR-100 with 2 time steps, and 68.69% on ImageNet with 4 time steps for static datasets, and 97.92% on DVS-Gesture and 83.60% on DVS-CIFAR10 for neuromorphic datasets. This marks the first time SNNs have outperformed ANNs on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, shedding the new light on the potential applications of SNNs.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches typically utilize external information such as semantic maps to improve video prediction accuracy, which often neglect the inherent physical knowledge embedded within videos. Worse still, their high computational costs could impede their applications for high-resolution videos. To address these constraints, we introduce a novel framework called \underline{P}hysics-\underline{a}ssisted \underline{S}patio-\underline{t}emporal \underline{Net}work (PastNet) for high-quality video prediction. The core of PastNet lies in incorporating a spectral convolution operator in the Fourier domain, which efficiently introduces inductive biases from the underlying physical laws. Additionally, we employ a memory bank with the estimated intrinsic dimensionality to discretize local features during the processing of complex spatio-temporal signals, thereby reducing computational costs and facilitating efficient high-resolution video prediction. Extensive experiments on various widely-used spatio-temporal video benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed PastNet compared with a range of state-of-the-art methods, particularly in high-resolution scenarios.</p></details> | 11 |

However, existing approaches that separate anomaly preprocessing from model training for multivariate time series prediction encounter significant limitations. Specifically, these methods fail to utilize auxiliary information crucial for identifying latent anomalies associated with spatiotemporal factors during the preprocessing stage. Instead, they rely solely on data distribution for anomaly detection, which can result in the incorrect processing of numerous samples that could otherwise contribute positively to model training. To address this, we propose STTS-EAD, an end-to-end method that seamlessly integrates anomaly detection into the training process of multivariate time series forecasting and aims to improve Spatio-Temporal learning based Time Series prediction via Embedded Anomaly Detection. Our proposed STTS-EAD leverages spatio-temporal information for forecasting and anomaly detection, with the two parts alternately executed and optimized for each other. To the best of our knowledge, STTS-EAD is the first to integrate anomaly detection and forecasting tasks in the training phase for improving the accuracy of multivariate time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on a public stock dataset and two real-world sales datasets from a renowned coffee chain enterprise show that our proposed method can effectively process detected anomalies in the training stage to improve forecasting performance in the inference stage and significantly outperform baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Small perturbations in conditions can often lead to significant changes in fire spread (such as speed and direction), necessitating a computationally expensive large set of simulations to quantify uncertainty. Model emulation seeks alternative representations of physical models using machine learning, aiming to provide more efficient and/or simplified surrogate models. We propose a dedicated spatio-temporal neural network based framework for model emulation, able to capture the complex behaviour of fire spread models. The proposed approach can approximate forecasts at fine spatial and temporal resolutions that are often challenging for neural network based approaches. Furthermore, the proposed approach is robust even with small training sets, due to novel data augmentation methods. Empirical experiments show good agreement between simulated and emulated firefronts, with an average Jaccard score of 0.76.</p></details> |  |
| **[KITS: Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging with Increment Training Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02565v2)** | 2025-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sensors are commonly deployed to perceive the environment. However, due to the high cost, sensors are usually sparsely deployed. Kriging is the tailored task to infer the unobserved nodes (without sensors) using the observed source nodes (with sensors). The essence of kriging task is transferability. Recently, several inductive spatio-temporal kriging methods have been proposed based on graph neural networks, being trained based on a graph built on top of observed nodes via pretext tasks such as masking nodes out and reconstructing them. However, the graph in training is inevitably much sparser than the graph in inference that includes all the observed and unobserved nodes. The learned pattern cannot be well generalized for inference, denoted as graph gap. To address this issue, we first present a novel Increment training strategy: instead of masking nodes (and reconstructing them), we add virtual nodes into the training graph so as to mitigate the graph gap issue naturally. Nevertheless, the empty-shell virtual nodes without labels could have bad-learned features and lack supervision signals. To solve these issues, we pair each virtual node with its most similar observed node and fuse their features together; to enhance the supervision signal, we construct reliable pseudo labels for virtual nodes. As a result, the learned pattern of virtual nodes could be safely transferred to real unobserved nodes for reliable kriging. We name our new Kriging model with Increment Training Strategy as KITS. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KITS consistently outperforms existing kriging methods by large margins, e.g., the improvement over MAE score could be as high as 18.33%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by AAAI'25</p></details> |
| **[AutoSTF: Decoupled Neural Architecture Search for Cost-Effective Automated Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16586v2)** | 2025-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is a critical component of various smart city applications, such as transportation optimization, energy management, and socio-economic analysis. Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |

However, due to the high heterogeneity in structure and semantics among various spatio-temporal modalities, the joint interpretation of multimodal spatio-temporal data has long been an extremely challenging problem. The primary challenge resides in striking a trade-off between the cohesion and autonomy of diverse modalities. This trade-off becomes progressively nonlinear as the number of modalities expands. Inspired by the human cognitive system and linguistic philosophy, where perceptual signals from the five senses converge into language, we introduce the Language as Reference Framework (LaRF), a fundamental principle for constructing a multimodal unified model. Building upon this, we propose AllSpark, a multimodal spatio-temporal general artificial intelligence model. Our model integrates ten different modalities into a unified framework. To achieve modal cohesion, AllSpark introduces a modal bridge and multimodal large language model (LLM) to map diverse modal features into the language feature space. To maintain modality autonomy, AllSpark uses modality-specific encoders to extract the tokens of various spatio-temporal modalities. Finally, observing a gap between the model's interpretability and downstream tasks, we designed modality-specific prompts and task heads, enhancing the model's generalization capability across specific tasks. Experiments indicate that the incorporation of language enables AllSpark to excel in few-shot classification tasks for RGB and point cloud modalities without additional training, surpassing baseline performance by up to 41.82\%.

However, traditional prediction methods are often limited by static spatial modeling, making it difficult to accurately capture the dynamic and complex relationships between time and space, thereby affecting prediction accuracy. This paper proposes an innovative traffic flow prediction network, SFADNet, which categorizes traffic flow into multiple traffic patterns based on temporal and spatial feature matrices. For each pattern, we construct an independent adaptive spatio-temporal fusion graph based on a cross-attention mechanism, employing residual graph convolution modules and time series modules to better capture dynamic spatio-temporal relationships under different fine-grained traffic patterns. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SFADNet outperforms current state-of-the-art baselines across four large-scale datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 lEEE International Conference on Acoustics, speech, and signal Processing (lCASSP2025)</p></details> |

However, the best practice for incorporating contextual features remains unclear due to inconsistent usage of contextual features in different papers. Developing a multifaceted dataset with rich types of contextual features and STCFP scenarios is crucial for establishing a principled context modeling paradigm. Existing open crowd flow datasets lack an adequate range of contextual features, which poses an urgent requirement to build a multifaceted dataset to fill these research gaps. To this end, we create STContext, a multifaceted dataset for developing context-aware STCFP models. Specifically, STContext provides nine spatio-temporal datasets across five STCFP scenarios and includes ten contextual features, including weather, air quality index, holidays, points of interest, road networks, etc. Besides, we propose a unified workflow for incorporating contextual features into deep STCFP methods, with steps including feature transformation, dependency modeling, representation fusion, and training strategies. Through extensive experiments, we have obtained several useful guidelines for effective context modeling and insights for future research.

Most approaches explore spatio-temporal information of multi-scan to identify the semantic classes and motion states for each point. However, these methods often overlook the segmentation consistency in space and time, which may result in point clouds within the same object being predicted as different categories. To handle this issue, our core idea is to generate cluster labels across multiple frames that can reflect the complete spatial structure and temporal information of objects. These labels serve as explicit guidance for our dual-branch network, 4D-CS, which integrates point-based and cluster-based branches to enable more consistent segmentation. Specifically, in the point-based branch, we leverage historical knowledge to enrich the current feature through temporal fusion on multiple views. In the cluster-based branch, we propose a new strategy to produce cluster labels of foreground objects and apply them to gather point-wise information to derive cluster features. We then merge neighboring clusters across multiple scans to restore missing features due to occlusion. Finally, in the point-cluster fusion stage, we adaptively fuse the information from the two branches to optimize segmentation results. Extensive experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, and we achieve state-of-the-art results on the multi-scan semantic and moving object segmentation on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets.

However, the high costs of building sensor networks limit their scale and coverage, making fine-grained deployment challenging. Inductive Spatio-Temporal Kriging (ISK) addresses this issue by introducing virtual sensors. Based on graph neural networks (GNNs) extracting the relationships between physical and virtual sensors, ISK can infer the measurements of virtual sensors from physical sensors. However, current ISK methods rely on conventional message-passing mechanisms and network architectures, without effectively extracting spatio-temporal features of physical sensors and focusing on representing virtual sensors. Additionally, existing graph construction methods face issues of sparse and noisy connections, destroying ISK performance. To address these issues, we propose DarkFarseer, a novel ISK framework with three key components. First, we propose the Neighbor Hidden Style Enhancement module with a style transfer strategy to enhance the representation of virtual nodes in a temporal-then-spatial manner to better extract the spatial relationships between physical and virtual nodes. Second, we propose Virtual-Component Contrastive Learning, which aims to enrich the node representation by establishing the association between the patterns of virtual nodes and the regional patterns within graph components. Lastly, we design a Similarity-Based Graph Denoising Strategy, which reduces the connectivity strength of noisy connections around virtual nodes and their neighbors based on their temporal information and regional spatial patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DarkFarseer significantly outperforms existing ISK methods.</p></details> | TKDE (Under Review) |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

In light of this, we propose a deep spatio-temporal hypergraph convolutional neural network for soft sensing (ST-HCSS). In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes. Our results validate the superiority of ST-HCSS compared to existing state-of-the-art soft sensors, and demonstrates that the learned hypergraph feature representations aligns well with the sensor data correlations.

This is achieved by learning low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional and raw trajectory data. However, existing methods for trajectory representation learning either rely on grid-based or road-based representations, which are inherently different and thus, could lose information contained in the other modality. Moreover, these methods overlook the dynamic nature of urban traffic, relying on static road network features rather than time varying traffic patterns. In this paper, we propose TIGR, a novel model designed to integrate grid and road network modalities while incorporating spatio-temporal dynamics to learn rich, general-purpose representations of trajectories. We evaluate TIGR on two realworld datasets and demonstrate the effectiveness of combining both modalities by substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, i.e., up to 43.22% for trajectory similarity, up to 16.65% for travel time estimation, and up to 10.16% for destination prediction.</p></details> |  |

Existing dynamic reconstruction methods often rely on per-scene optimization, dense observations across space and time, and strong motion supervision, resulting in lengthy optimization times, limited generalization to novel views or scenes, and degenerated quality caused by noisy pseudo-labels for dynamics. To address these challenges, STORM leverages a data-driven Transformer architecture that directly infers dynamic 3D scene representations--parameterized by 3D Gaussians and their velocities--in a single forward pass. Our key design is to aggregate 3D Gaussians from all frames using self-supervised scene flows, transforming them to the target timestep to enable complete (i.e., "amodal") reconstructions from arbitrary viewpoints at any moment in time. As an emergent property, STORM automatically captures dynamic instances and generates high-quality masks using only reconstruction losses. Extensive experiments on public datasets show that STORM achieves precise dynamic scene reconstruction, surpassing state-of-the-art per-scene optimization methods (+4.3 to 6.6 PSNR) and existing feed-forward approaches (+2.1 to 4.7 PSNR) in dynamic regions. STORM reconstructs large-scale outdoor scenes in 200ms, supports real-time rendering, and outperforms competitors in scene flow estimation, improving 3D EPE by 0.422m and Acc5 by 28.02%. Beyond reconstruction, we showcase four additional applications of our model, illustrating the potential of self-supervised learning for broader dynamic scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at: https://jiawei-yang.github.io/STORM/</p></details> |

To solve this problem, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Aggregation eorganization ransformer (STARFormer) that effectively captures both spatial and temporal features of BOLD signals by incorporating three key modules. The region of interest (ROI) spatial structure analysis module uses eigenvector centrality (EC) to reorganize brain regions based on effective connectivity, highlighting critical spatial relationships relevant to the brain disorder. The temporal feature reorganization module systematically segments the time series into equal-dimensional window tokens and captures multiscale features through variable window and cross-window attention. The spatio-temporal feature fusion module employs a parallel transformer architecture with dedicated temporal and spatial branches to extract integrated features. The proposed STARFormer has been rigorously evaluated on two publicly available datasets for the classification of ASD and ADHD. The experimental results confirm that the STARFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, providing a more accurate and reliable tool for the diagnosis of brain disorders and biomedical research. The codes will be available at: https://github.com/NZWANG/STARFormer.</p></details> |  |

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have garnered widespread attention in this field for their proficiency in capturing relationships among joints in human motion. However, existing GCN-based methods tend to focus on either temporal-domain or spatial-domain features, or they combine spatio-temporal features without fully leveraging the complementarity and cross-dependency of these two features. In this paper, we propose the Spatial-Temporal Multi-Subgraph Graph Convolutional Network (STMS-GCN) to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies in human motion. Specifically, we decouple the modeling of temporal and spatial dependencies, enabling cross-domain knowledge transfer at multiple scales through a spatio-temporal information consistency constraint mechanism. Besides, we utilize multiple subgraphs to extract richer motion information and enhance the learning associations of diverse subgraphs through a homogeneous information constraint mechanism. Extensive experiments on the standard HMP benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method.</p></details> |  |

We leverage an explicit link between stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) and GPs on graphs, introduce a framework for deriving graph kernels via SPDEs, and derive non-separable spatio-temporal graph kernels that capture interaction across space and time. We formulate the graph kernels for the stochastic heat equation and wave equation. We show that by providing novel tools for spatio-temporal GP modelling on graphs, we outperform pre-existing graph kernels in real-world applications that feature diffusion, oscillation, and other complicated interactions.</p></details> |  |

However, existing whole-body-object interaction video benchmarks overlook the truth that open-world objects are diverse, that is, they usually provide limited and predefined object classes. Therefore, we introduce a new open-world benchmark: Grounding Interacted Objects (GIO) including 1,098 interacted objects class and 290K interacted object boxes annotation. Accordingly, an object grounding task is proposed expecting vision systems to discover interacted objects. Even though today's detectors and grounding methods have succeeded greatly, they perform unsatisfactorily in localizing diverse and rare objects in GIO. This profoundly reveals the limitations of current vision systems and poses a great challenge.

By analyzing data over a 30-day period with comparable climate and average temperatures, we explored differences in BSS usage between weekdays and weekends in those cities using Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) and rank distribution analysis. Our findings reveal significant temporal differences in BSS usage that were commonly observed in all cities, with weekday patterns dominated by commute peaks and weekend patterns reflecting recreational activities. Friday emerges as a transitional day, sharing the characteristics of both weekdays and weekends. Meanwhile, docking station usage rank distributions show remarkable consistency between weekdays and weekends for most cities, with London being a unique anomaly. This study highlights the potential of BSS data to uncover urban mobility patterns and the underlying structures of cities. The results suggest that BSS usage reflects both intrinsic user behavior and external influences such as urban planning.</p></details> | 16pages, 5figures |

However, existing FER methods face three key challenges in real-world applications: (i) they rely on large amounts of continuously annotated data to ensure accuracy since emotions are complex and ambiguous in reality, which is costly and time-consuming; (ii) they cannot capture the temporal heterogeneity caused by changing emotion patterns, because they usually assume that the temporal correlation within sampling periods is the same; (iii) they do not consider the spatial heterogeneity of different FER scenarios, that is, the distribution of emotion information in different data may have bias or interference. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Fuzzy-oriented Multi-modal Meta-learning framework (ST-F2M). Specifically, ST-F2M first divides the multi-modal videos into multiple views, and each view corresponds to one modality of one emotion. Multiple randomly selected views for the same emotion form a meta-training task. Next, ST-F2M uses an integrated module with spatial and temporal convolutions to encode the data of each task, reflecting the spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Then it adds fuzzy semantic information to each task based on generalized fuzzy rules, which helps handle the complexity and ambiguity of emotions. Finally, ST-F2M learns emotion-related general meta-knowledge through meta-recurrent neural networks to achieve fast and robust fine-grained emotion recognition. Extensive experiments show that ST-F2M outperforms various state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and model efficiency. In addition, we construct ablation studies and further analysis to explore why ST-F2M performs well.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, Submitted to TMM in 30-May-2024</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Electromagnetic Kernel Learning for Channel Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17414v1)** | 2024-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate channel prediction is essential for addressing channel aging caused by user mobility. However, the actual channel variations over time are highly complex in high-mobility scenarios, which makes it difficult for existing predictors to obtain future channels accurately. The low accuracy of channel predictors leads to difficulties in supporting reliable communication. To overcome this challenge, we propose a channel predictor based on spatio-temporal electromagnetic (EM) kernel learning (STEM-KL). Specifically, inspired by recent advancements in EM information theory (EIT), the STEM kernel function is derived. The velocity and the concentration kernel parameters are designed to reflect the time-varying propagation of the wireless signal. We obtain the parameters through kernel learning. Then, the future channels are predicted by computing their Bayesian posterior, with the STEM kernel acting as the prior. To further improve the stability and model expressibility, we propose a grid-based EM mixed kernel learning (GEM-KL) scheme. We design the mixed kernel to be a convex combination of multiple sub-kernels, where each of the sub-kernel corresponds to a grid point in the set of pre-selected parameters. This approach transforms non-convex STEM kernel learning problem into a convex grid-based problem that can be easily solved by weight optimization. Finally, simulation results verify that the proposed STEM-KL and GEM-KL schemes can achieve more accurate channel prediction. This indicates that EIT can improve the performance of wireless system efficiently.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper proposes an EIT-inspired Gaussian process regression (GPR)-based channel predictor with improved performance.

Among the many variables captured through satellite sensors, Land Surface Temperature (LST) plays a critical role in understanding key environmental processes. However, obtaining high-resolution LST data remains a challenge, as satellite sensors often face a trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. In response, Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) has emerged as a powerful method to integrate two satellite data sources, one providing high spatial but low temporal resolution, and the other offering high temporal but low spatial resolution. Although a range of STF techniques have been proposed, from traditional methods to cutting-edge deep learning (DL) models, most have focused on surface reflectance, with limited application to LST estimation. DL approaches, in particular, show promise in improving the spatial and temporal resolutions of LST by capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input and output LST data. This paper offers a comprehensive review of the latest advancements in DL-based STF techniques for LST estimation. We analyze key research developments, mathematically formulate the STF problem, and introduce a novel taxonomy for DL-based STF methods. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges faced by current methods and highlight future research directions. In addition, we present the first open-source benchmark STF dataset for LST estimation, consisting of 51 pairs of MODIS-Landsat images spanning from 2013 to 2024. To support our findings, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art methods and present both quantitative and qualitative assessments. This is the first survey paper focused on DL-based STF for LST estimation. We hope it serves as a valuable reference for researchers and paves the way for future research in this field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the Proceedings of IEEE</p></details> |

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Dynamic Edge Service Placement Under Spatio-Temporal Correlated Demand Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15608v1)** | 2024-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge computing allows Service Providers (SPs) to enhance user experience by placing their services closer to the network edge. Determining the optimal provisioning of edge resources to meet the varying and uncertain demand cost-effectively is a critical task for SPs. This paper introduces a novel two-stage multi-period robust model for edge service placement and workload allocation, aiming to minimize the SP's operating costs while ensuring service quality. The salient feature of this model lies in its ability to enable SPs to utilize dynamic service placement and leverage spatio-temporal correlation in demand uncertainties to mitigate the inherent conservatism of robust solutions. In our model, resource reservation is optimized in the initial stage, preemptively, before the actual demand is disclosed, whereas dynamic service placement and workload allocation are determined in the subsequent stage, following the revelation of uncertainties. To address the challenges posed by integer recourse variables in the second stage of the resulting tri-level adjustable robust optimization problem, we propose a novel iterative, decomposition-based approach, ensuring finite convergence to an exact optimal solution. Extensive numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model and approach.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Yet, causal inference with these data remains challenging due to the twin threats of spatial spillover and temporal carryover effects. We develop methods to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects by allowing for arbitrary spatial and temporal causal dependencies. We focus on common settings where the treatment and outcomes are time-varying spatial point patterns and where moderators are either spatial or spatio-temporal in nature. We define causal estimands based on stochastic interventions where researchers specify counterfactual distributions of treatment events. We propose the Hajek-type estimator of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) as a function of spatio-temporal moderator variables, and establish its asymptotic normality as the number of time periods increases. We then introduce a statistical test of no heterogeneous treatment effects. Through simulations, we evaluate the finite-sample performance of the proposed CATE estimator and its inferential properties. Our motivating application examines the heterogeneous effects of US airstrikes on insurgent violence in Iraq. Drawing on declassified spatio-temporal data, we examine how prior aid distributions moderate airstrike effects. Contrary to expectations from counterinsurgency theories, we find that prior aid distribution, along with greater amounts of aid per capita, is associated with increased insurgent attacks following airstrikes.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we propose a novel fall detection system using FLAMe (Federated Learning with Attention Mechanism), a federated learning (FL) based algorithm. FLAMe trains around important keypoint information and only transmits the trained important weights to the server, reducing communication costs and preserving data privacy. Furthermore, the lightweight keypoint transformer model is integrated into the FL framework to effectively learn spatio-temporal features. We validated the experiment using 22,672 video samples from the "Fall Accident Risk Behavior Video-Sensor Pair data" dataset from AI-Hub. As a result of the experiment, the FLAMe-based system achieved an accuracy of 94.02% with about 190,000 transmission parameters, maintaining performance similar to that of existing centralized learning while maximizing efficiency by reducing communication costs by about 40% compared to the existing FL algorithm, FedAvg. Therefore, the FLAMe algorithm has demonstrated that it provides robust performance in the distributed environment of smart cities and is a practical and effective solution for public safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, AAAI 2025 FLUID Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Global Spatio-Temporal Fusion-based Traffic Prediction Algorithm with Anomaly Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14569v1)** | 2024-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is an indispensable component of urban planning and traffic management. Achieving accurate traffic prediction hinges on the ability to capture the potential spatio-temporal relationships among road sensors. However, the majority of existing works focus on local short-term spatio-temporal correlations, failing to fully consider the interactions of different sensors in the long-term state. In addition, these works do not analyze the influences of anomalous factors, or have insufficient ability to extract personalized features of anomalous factors, which make them ineffectively capture their spatio-temporal influences on traffic prediction. To address the aforementioned issues, We propose a global spatio-temporal fusion-based traffic prediction algorithm that incorporates anomaly awareness. Initially, based on the designed anomaly detection network, we construct an efficient anomalous factors impacting module (AFIM), to evaluate the spatio-temporal impact of unexpected external events on traffic prediction. Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale spatio-temporal feature fusion module (MTSFFL) based on the transformer architecture, to obtain all possible both long and short term correlations among different sensors in a wide-area traffic environment for accurate prediction of traffic flow. Finally, experiments are implemented based on real-scenario public transportation datasets (PEMS04 and PEMS08) to demonstrate that our approach can achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Forecasting of PM2.5 via Spatial-Diffusion guided Encoder-Decoder Architecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13935v1)** | 2024-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many problem settings that require spatio-temporal forecasting, the values in the time-series not only exhibit spatio-temporal correlations but are also influenced by spatial diffusion across locations. One such example is forecasting the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the atmosphere which is influenced by many complex factors, the most important ones being diffusion due to meteorological factors as well as transport across vast distances over a period of time. We present a novel Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network architecture, that specifically captures these dependencies to forecast the PM2.5 concentration. Our model is based on an encoder-decoder architecture where the encoder and decoder parts leverage gated recurrent units (GRU) augmented with a graph neural network (TransformerConv) to account for spatial diffusion. Our model can also be seen as a generalization of various existing models for time-series or spatio-temporal forecasting. We demonstrate the model's effectiveness on two real-world PM2.5 datasets: (1) data collected by us using a recently deployed network of low-cost PM$_{2.5}$ sensors from 511 locations spanning the entirety of the Indian state of Bihar over a period of one year, and (2) another publicly available dataset that covers severely polluted regions from China for a period of 4 years. Our experimental results show our model's impressive ability to account for both spatial as well as temporal dependencies precisely.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, International Conference on Data Science and Management of Data (CODS-COMAD), IIT Jodhpur, 2024</p></details> |

This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.

| **[2D-AoI: Age-of-Information of Distributed Sensors for Spatio-Temporal Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12789v1)** | 2024-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The freshness of sensor data is critical for all types of cyber-physical systems. An established measure for quantifying data freshness is the Age-of-Information (AoI), which has been the subject of extensive research. Recently, there has been increased interest in multi-sensor systems: redundant sensors producing samples of the same physical process, sensors such as cameras producing overlapping views, or distributed sensors producing correlated samples. When the information from a particular sensor is outdated, fresh samples from other correlated sensors can be helpful. To quantify the utility of distant but correlated samples, we put forth a two-dimensional (2D) model of AoI that takes into account the sensor distance in an age-equivalent representation. Since we define 2D-AoI as equivalent to AoI, it can be readily linked to existing AoI research, especially on parallel systems. We consider physical phenomena modeled as spatio-temporal processes and derive the 2D-AoI for different Gaussian correlation kernels. For a basic exponential product kernel, we find that spatial distance causes an additive offset of the AoI, while for other kernels the effects of spatial distance are more complex and vary with time. Using our methodology, we evaluate the 2D-AoI of different spatial topologies and sensor densities.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the development of TextVQA in image domain, existing Video TextVQA approaches leverage a language model (e.g. T5) to process text-rich multiple frames and generate answers auto-regressively. Nevertheless, the spatio-temporal relationships among visual entities (including scene text and objects) will be disrupted and models are susceptible to interference from unrelated information, resulting in irrational reasoning and inaccurate answering. To tackle these challenges, we propose the TEA (stands for ``\textbf{T}rack th\textbf{E} \textbf{A}nswer'') method that better extends the generative TextVQA framework from image to video. TEA recovers the spatio-temporal relationships in a complementary way and incorporates OCR-aware clues to enhance the quality of reasoning questions. Extensive experiments on several public Video TextVQA datasets validate the effectiveness and generalization of our framework. TEA outperforms existing TextVQA methods, video-language pretraining methods and video large language models by great margins.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Levy-Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Process: Towards Big Data Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.08451v2)** | 2024-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this era of big data, all scientific disciplines are evolving fast to cope up with the enormity of the available information. So is statistics, the queen of science. Big data are particularly relevant to spatio-temporal statistics, thanks to much-improved technology in satellite based remote sensing and Geographical Information Systems. However, none of the existing approaches seem to meet the simultaneous demand of reality emulation and cheap computation. In this article, with the Levy random fields as the starting point, e construct a new Bayesian nonparametric, nonstationary and nonseparable dynamic spatio-temporal model with the additional realistic property that the lagged spatio-temporal correlations converge to zero as the lag tends to infinity. Although our Bayesian model seems to be intricately structured and is variable-dimensional with respect to each time index, we are able to devise a fast and efficient parallel Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian inference. Our simulation experiment brings out quite encouraging performance from our Bayesian Levy-dynamic approach. We finally apply our Bayesian Levy-dynamic model and methods to a sea surface temperature dataset consisting of 139,300 data points in space and time. Although not big data in the true sense, this is a large and highly structured data by any standard. Even for this large and complex data, our parallel MCMC algorithm, implemented on 80 processors, generated 110,000 MCMC realizations from the Levy-dynamic posterior within a single day, and the resultant Bayesian posterior predictive analysis turned out to be encouraging. Thus, it is not unreasonable to expect that with significantly more computing resources, it is feasible to analyse terabytes of spatio-temporal data with our new model and methods.</p></details> | An updated version |

However, the complex and dynamic nature of these correlations presents significant modeling challenges. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal dynamic hypergraph learning (STDHL) model. This model uses a hypergraph structure to represent spatial features among wind farms. Unlike traditional graph structures, which only capture pair-wise node features, hypergraphs create hyperedges connecting multiple nodes, enabling the representation and transmission of higher-order spatial features. The STDHL model incorporates a novel dynamic hypergraph convolutional layer to model dynamic spatial correlations and a grouped temporal convolutional layer for channel-independent temporal modeling. The model uses spatio-temporal encoders to extract features from multi-source covariates, which are mapped to quantile results through a forecast decoder. Experimental results using the GEFCom dataset show that the STDHL model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis highlights the critical role of spatio-temporal covariates in improving ultra-short-term forecasting accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, existing transformer-based methods primarily use self-attention mechanisms for spatio-temporal modeling, leading to a quadratic complexity, unidirectional modeling of spatio-temporal relationships, and insufficient learning of spatial-temporal correlations. Recently, the Mamba architecture, utilizing the state space model (SSM), has exhibited superior long-range modeling capabilities in a variety of vision tasks with linear complexity. In this paper, we propose PoseMamba, a novel purely SSM-based approach with linear complexity for 3D human pose estimation in monocular video. Specifically, we propose a bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block that comprehensively models human joint relations within individual frames as well as temporal correlations across frames. Within this bidirectional global-local spatio-temporal SSM block, we introduce a reordering strategy to enhance the local modeling capability of the SSM. This strategy provides a more logical geometric scanning order and integrates it with the global SSM, resulting in a combined global-local spatial scan. We have quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated our approach using two benchmark datasets: Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance on both datasets while maintaining a smaller model size and reducing computational costs.

The key of VLLMs is to encode visual content into sequences of visual tokens, enabling VLLMs to simultaneously process both visual and textual content. However, understanding videos, especially long videos, remain a challenge to VLLMs as the number of visual tokens grows rapidly when encoding videos, resulting in the risk of exceeding the context window of VLLMs and introducing heavy computation burden. To restrict the number of visual tokens, existing VLLMs either: (1) uniformly downsample videos into a fixed number of frames or (2) reducing the number of visual tokens encoded from each frame. We argue the former solution neglects the rich temporal cue in videos and the later overlooks the spatial details in each frame. In this work, we present Balanced-VLLM (B-VLLM): a novel VLLM framework that aims to effectively leverage task relevant spatio-temporal cues while restricting the number of visual tokens under the VLLM context window length. At the core of our method, we devise a text-conditioned adaptive frame selection module to identify frames relevant to the visual understanding task. The selected frames are then de-duplicated using a temporal frame token merging technique. The visual tokens of the selected frames are processed through a spatial token sampling module and an optional spatial token merging strategy to achieve precise control over the token count. Experimental results show that B-VLLM is effective in balancing the number of frames and visual tokens in video understanding, yielding superior performance on various video understanding benchmarks.

Schr\"odinger in 1931/32. It represents an early formulation of a maximum likelihood problem. This specific formulation can also be seen as the control problem to modify the law of a diffusion process so as to match specifications on marginal distributions at given times. Thereby, in recent years, this so-called Schr\"odinger's bridge problem has been at the center of the uncertainty control development. However, an understudied facet of this program has been to address uncertainty in space (state) and time, modeling the effect of tasks being completed contingent on meeting a certain condition at some random time instead of imposing specifications at fixed times. The present work is a study to extend Schr\"odinger's paradigm on such an issue, and herein, it is tackled in the context of random walks on directed graphs. Specifically, we study the case where one marginal is the initial probability distribution on a Markov chain, while others are marginals of stopping (first-arrival) times at absorbing states, signifying completion of tasks. We show when the prior law on paths is Markov, a Markov policy is once again optimal to satisfy those marginal constraints with respect to a likelihood cost following Schr\"odinger's dictum. Based on this, we present the mathematical formulation involving a Sinkhorn-type iteration to construct the optimal probability law on paths matching the spatio-temporal marginals.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

In particular, Saudi Arabia is gradually shifting its energy portfolio from an exclusive use of oil to a reliance on renewable energy, and, in particular, wind. Modeling wind for assessing potential energy output in a country as large, geographically diverse and understudied as Saudi Arabia is a challenge which implies highly non-linear dynamic structures in both space and time. To address this, we propose a spatio-temporal model whose spatial information is first reduced via an energy distance-based approach and then its dynamical behavior is informed by a sparse and stochastic recurrent neural network (Echo State Network). Finally, the full spatial data is reconstructed by means of a non-stationary stochastic partial differential equation-based approach. Our model can capture the fine scale wind structure and produce more accurate forecasts of both wind speed and energy in lead times of interest for energy grid management and save annually as much as one million dollar against the closest competitive model.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the lagged correlations converge to zero as the spatio-temporal lag goes to infinity. We investigate the theoretical properties of the new spatio-temporal process, including its continuity and smoothness properties. We derive methods for complete Bayesian inference using MCMC techniques in the Bayesian paradigm. The performance of our method has been compared with that of a non-stationary Gaussian process (GP) using two simulation studies, where our method shows a significant improvement over the non-stationary GP.

We present a comprehensive analysis of time integration methods, highlighting the adaptation of the two-step Adams-Bashforth scheme to enhance long-term prediction robustness in auto-regressive models. Additionally, we improve temporal prediction accuracy through a multi-step rollout strategy that incorporates multiple future time steps during training, supported by three newly proposed approaches that dynamically adjust the importance of each future step. By integrating the Adams-Bashforth scheme with adaptive multi-step strategies, our graph neural network-based auto-regressive model accurately predicts 350 future time steps, even under practical constraints such as limited training data and minimal model capacity -- achieving an error of only 1.6% compared to the vanilla auto-regressive approach. Moreover, our framework demonstrates an 83% improvement in rollout performance over the standard noise injection method, a standard technique for enhancing long-term rollout performance. Its effectiveness is further validated in more challenging scenarios with truncated meshes, showcasing its adaptability and robustness in practical applications. This work introduces a versatile framework for robust long-term spatio-temporal auto-regressive predictions, effectively mitigating error accumulation across various model types and engineering discipline.</p></details> |  |

Although many existing methods utilize multi-head attention mechanisms and message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) to capture both spatial and temporal relations, these approaches encode temporal and spatial relations independently, and reflect the graph's topological characteristics in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce the Cycle to Mixer (Cy2Mixer), a novel spatio-temporal GNN based on topological non-trivial invariants of spatio-temporal graphs with gated multi-layer perceptrons (gMLP). The Cy2Mixer is composed of three blocks based on MLPs: A temporal block for capturing temporal properties, a message-passing block for encapsulating spatial information, and a cycle message-passing block for enriching topological information through cyclic subgraphs. We bolster the effectiveness of Cy2Mixer with mathematical evidence emphasizing that our cycle message-passing block is capable of offering differentiated information to the deep learning model compared to the message-passing block. Furthermore, empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of the Cy2Mixer, demonstrating state-of-the-art performances across various spatio-temporal benchmark datasets.

Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

| **[A Spatio-Temporal Representation Learning as an Alternative to Traditional Glosses in Sign Language Translation and Production](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02854v2)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work addresses the challenges associated with the use of glosses in both Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Sign Language Production (SLP). While glosses have long been used as a bridge between sign language and spoken language, they come with two major limitations that impede the advancement of sign language systems. First, annotating the glosses is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, which limits the scalability of datasets. Second, the glosses oversimplify sign language by stripping away its spatio-temporal dynamics, reducing complex signs to basic labels and missing the subtle movements essential for precise interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce Universal Gloss-level Representation (UniGloR), a framework designed to capture the spatio-temporal features inherent in sign language, providing a more dynamic and detailed alternative to the use of the glosses. The core idea of UniGloR is simple yet effective: We derive dense spatio-temporal representations from sign keypoint sequences using self-supervised learning and seamlessly integrate them into SLT and SLP tasks. Our experiments in a keypoint-based setting demonstrate that UniGloR either outperforms or matches the performance of previous SLT and SLP methods on two widely-used datasets: PHOENIX14T and How2Sign.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03188v1)** | 2024-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased computation of partial embeddings.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, conference</p></details> |
| **[Multi-resolution filters via linear projection for large spatio-temporal datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05315v2)** | 2024-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in compact sensing devices mounted on satellites have facilitated the collection of large spatio-temporal datasets with coordinates. Since such datasets are often incomplete and noisy, it is useful to create the prediction surface of a spatial field. To this end, we consider an online filtering inference by using the Kalman filter based on linear Gaussian state-space models. However, the Kalman filter is impractically time-consuming when the number of locations in spatio-temporal datasets is large. To address this problem, we propose a multi-resolution filter via linear projection (MRF-lp), a fast computation method for online filtering inference. In the MRF-lp, by carrying out a multi-resolution approximation via linear projection (MRA-lp), the forecast covariance matrix can be approximated while capturing both the large- and small-scale spatial variations. As a result of this approximation, our proposed MRF-lp preserves a block-sparse structure of some matrices appearing in the MRF-lp through time, which leads to the scalability of this algorithm. Additionally, we discuss extensions of the MRF-lp to a nonlinear and non-Gaussian case. Simulation studies and real data analysis for total precipitable water vapor demonstrate that our proposed approach performs well compared with the related methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 10 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Navigating Challenges in Spatio-temporal Modelling of Antarctic Krill Abundance: Addressing Zero-inflated Data and Misaligned Covariates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01399v1)** | 2024-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) are among the most abundant species on our planet and serve as a vital food source for many marine predators in the Southern Ocean. In this paper, we utilise statistical spatio-temporal methods to combine data from various sources and resolutions, aiming to accurately model krill abundance. Our focus lies in fitting the model to a dataset comprising acoustic measurements of krill biomass. To achieve this, we integrate climate covariates obtained from satellite imagery and from drifting surface buoys (also known as drifters). Additionally, we use sparsely collected krill biomass data obtained from net fishing efforts (KRILLBASE) for validation. However, integrating these multiple heterogeneous data sources presents significant modelling challenges, including spatio-temporal misalignment and inflated zeros in the observed data. To address these challenges, we fit a Hurdle-Gamma model to jointly describe the occurrence of zeros and the krill biomass for the non-zero observations, while also accounting for misaligned and heterogeneous data sources, including drifters. Therefore, our work presents a comprehensive framework for analysing and predicting krill abundance in the Southern Ocean, leveraging information from various sources and formats. This is crucial due to the impact of krill fishing, as understanding their distribution is essential for informed management decisions and fishing regulations aimed at protecting the species.</p></details> |  |
| **[STEP: Enhancing Video-LLMs' Compositional Reasoning by Spatio-Temporal Graph-guided Self-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00161v1)** | 2024-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have recently shown strong performance in basic video understanding tasks, such as captioning and coarse-grained question answering, but struggle with compositional reasoning that requires multi-step spatio-temporal inference across object relations, interactions, and events. The hurdles to enhancing this capability include extensive manual labor, the lack of spatio-temporal compositionality in existing data and the absence of explicit reasoning supervision. In this paper, we propose STEP, a novel graph-guided self-training method that enables Video-LLMs to generate reasoning-rich fine-tuning data from any raw videos to improve itself. Specifically, we first induce Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph (STSG) representation of diverse videos to capture fine-grained, multi-granular video semantics. Then, the STSGs guide the derivation of multi-step reasoning Question-Answer (QA) data with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales. Both answers and rationales are integrated as training objective, aiming to enhance model's reasoning abilities by supervision over explicit reasoning steps. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of STEP across models of varying scales, with a significant 21.3\% improvement in tasks requiring three or more reasoning steps. Furthermore, it achieves superior performance with a minimal amount of self-generated rationale-enriched training samples in both compositional reasoning and comprehensive understanding benchmarks, highlighting the broad applicability and vast potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[STANet: A Novel Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for Depression Classification with Small and Unbalanced FMRI Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21323v2)** | 2024-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate diagnosis of depression is crucial for timely implementation of optimal treatments, preventing complications and reducing the risk of suicide. Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers. Combining fMRI with artificial intelligence can enhance depression diagnosis by integrating neuroimaging indicators. However, the specificity of fMRI acquisition for depression often results in unbalanced and small datasets, challenging the sensitivity and accuracy of classification models. In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity. STANet comprises the following steps:(1) Aggregate spatio-temporal information via ICA. (2) Utilize multi-scale deep convolution to capture detailed features. (3) Balance data using the SMOTE to generate new samples for minority classes. (4) Employ the AFGRU classifier, which combines Fourier transformation with GRU, to capture long-term dependencies, with an adaptive weight assignment mechanism to enhance model generalization. The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC. SMOTE outperforms other oversampling methods. Additionally, spatio-temporal aggregated features achieve better performance compared to using only temporal or spatial features. STANet outperforms traditional or deep learning classifiers, and functional connectivity-based classifiers, as demonstrated by ten-fold cross-validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is published on Tomography</p></details> |

We are the first to propose a new benchmark for multi-person spatio-temporal complex activity localization, where complex semantic and long duration bring new challenges to localization tasks. We observe that limited atomic actions can be combined into many complex activities. MM-SEAL provides both atomic action and complex activity annotations, producing 111.7k atomic actions spanning 172 action categories and 17.7k complex activities spanning 200 activity categories. We explore the relationship between atomic actions and complex activities, finding that atomic action features can improve the complex activity localization performance. Also, we propose a new network which generates temporal proposals and labels simultaneously, termed Faster-TAD. Finally, our evaluations show that visual features pretrained on MM-SEAL can improve the performance on other action localization benchmarks. We will release the dataset and the project code upon publication of the paper.</p></details> | 17 pages,6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v2)** | 2024-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low power computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent outputs and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of SNNs for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only a temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Spatio-temporal Causal Learning for Streamflow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17937v1)** | 2024-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Streamflow plays an essential role in the sustainable planning and management of national water resources. Traditional hydrologic modeling approaches simulate streamflow by establishing connections across multiple physical processes, such as rainfall and runoff. These data, inherently connected both spatially and temporally, possess intrinsic causal relations that can be leveraged for robust and accurate forecasting. Recently, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs) have been adopted, excelling in various domains, such as urban traffic management, weather forecasting, and pandemic control, and they also promise advances in streamflow management. However, learning causal relationships directly from vast observational data is theoretically and computationally challenging. In this study, we employ a river flow graph as prior knowledge to facilitate the learning of the causal structure and then use the learned causal graph to predict streamflow at targeted sites. The proposed model, Causal Streamflow Forecasting (CSF) is tested in a real-world study in the Brazos River basin in Texas. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms regular spatio-temporal graph neural networks and achieves higher computational efficiency compared to traditional simulation methods. By effectively integrating river flow graphs with STGNNs, this research offers a novel approach to streamflow prediction, showcasing the potential of combining advanced neural network techniques with domain-specific knowledge for enhanced performance in hydrologic modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at IEEE Big Data 2024</p></details> |
| **[GAST: Sequential Gaussian Avatars with Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16768v1)** | 2024-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D human avatars, through the use of canonical radiance fields and per-frame observed warping, enable high-fidelity rendering and animating. However, existing methods, which rely on either spatial SMPL(-X) poses or temporal embeddings, respectively suffer from coarse rendering quality or limited animation flexibility. To address these challenges, we propose GAST, a framework that unifies 3D human modeling with 3DGS by hierarchically integrating both spatial and temporal information. Specifically, we design a sequential conditioning framework for the non-rigid warping of the human body, under whose guidance more accurate 3D Gaussians can be obtained in the observation space. Moreover, the explicit properties of Gaussians allow us to embed richer sequential information, encompassing both the coarse sequence of human poses and finer per-vertex motion details. These sequence conditions are further sampled across different temporal scales, in a coarse-to-fine manner, ensuring unbiased inputs for non-rigid warping. Experimental results demonstrate that our method combined with hierarchical spatio-temporal modeling surpasses concurrent baselines, delivering both high-quality rendering and flexible animating capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distribution-aware Online Continual Learning for Urban Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15893v1)** | 2024-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal (ST) forecasting is crucial for various urban applications such as intelligent scheduling and trip planning. Previous studies focus on modeling ST correlations among urban locations in offline settings, which often neglect the non-stationary nature of urban ST data, particularly, distribution shifts over time. This oversight can lead to degraded performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we first analyze the distribution shifts in urban ST data, and then introduce DOST, a novel online continual learning framework tailored for ST data characteristics. DOST employs an adaptive ST network equipped with a variable-independent adapter to address the unique distribution shifts at each urban location dynamically. Further, to accommodate the gradual nature of these shifts, we also develop an awake-hibernate learning strategy that intermittently fine-tunes the adapter during the online phase to reduce computational overhead. This strategy integrates a streaming memory update mechanism designed for urban ST sequential data, enabling effective network adaptation to new patterns while preventing catastrophic forgetting. Experimental results confirm DOST's superiority over state-of-the-art models on four real-world datasets, providing online forecasts within an average of 0.1 seconds and achieving a 12.89% reduction in forecast errors compared to baseline models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Weakly-supervised Video Instance Segmentation by Leveraging Spatio-temporal Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16661v2)** | 2024-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Video Instance Segmentation (VIS) methods has improved significantly with the advent of transformer networks. However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-Cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-Video Instance Segmentation (YouTube-VIS) 2019/2021 and Occluded Video Instance Segmentation (OVIS) datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While the ERA5 reanalysis dataset provides consistent long-term global precipitation information that allows investigations of these impacts, it lacks the resolution to capture the high spatio-temporal variability of precipitation. ERA5 misses intense local rainfall events that are crucial drivers of devastating flooding - a critical limitation since extreme weather events become increasingly frequent. Here, we introduce spateGAN-ERA5, the first deep learning based spatio-temporal downscaling of precipitation data on a global scale. SpateGAN-ERA5 uses a conditional generative adversarial neural network (cGAN) that enhances the resolution of ERA5 precipitation data from 24 km and 1 hour to 2 km and 10 minutes, delivering high-resolution rainfall fields with realistic spatio-temporal patterns and accurate rain rate distribution including extremes. Its computational efficiency enables the generation of a large ensemble of solutions, addressing uncertainties inherent to the challenges of downscaling. Trained solely on data from Germany and validated in the US and Australia considering diverse climate zones, spateGAN-ERA5 demonstrates strong generalization indicating a robust global applicability. SpateGAN-ERA5 fulfils a critical need for high-resolution precipitation data in hydrological and meteorological research, offering new capabilities for flood risk assessment, AI-enhanced weather forecasting, and impact modelling to address climate-driven challenges worldwide.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on using spatio-temporal disease mapping models to explore the temporal trends of IHD at the county level from 1999 to 2021. To manage the computational burden arising from the high-dimensional data, we employ scalable Bayesian models using a "divide and conquer" strategy. This approach allows for fast model fitting and serves as an efficient procedure for screening spatio-temporal patterns. Additionally, we analyze trends in four regional subdivisions, West, Midwest, South and Northeast, and in urban and rural areas. The dataset on IHD contains missing data, and we propose a procedure to impute the omitted information. The results show a slowdown in the decrease of IHD mortality in the US after 2014 with a slight increase noted after 2019. However, differences exists among the counties, the four big geographical regions, and rural and urban areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Spatio-Temporal Signal Recognition on Edge Devices Using PointLCA-Net](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14585v1)** | 2024-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in machine learning, particularly through deep learning architectures like PointNet, have transformed the processing of three-dimensional (3D) point clouds, significantly improving 3D object classification and segmentation tasks. While 3D point clouds provide detailed spatial information, spatio-temporal signals introduce a dynamic element that accounts for changes over time. However, applying deep learning techniques to spatio-temporal signals and deploying them on edge devices presents challenges, including real-time processing, memory capacity, and power consumption. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel approach that combines PointNet's feature extraction with the in-memory computing capabilities and energy efficiency of neuromorphic systems for spatio-temporal signal recognition. The proposed method consists of a two-stage process: in the first stage, PointNet extracts features from the spatio-temporal signals, which are then stored in non-volatile memristor crossbar arrays. In the second stage, these features are processed by a single-layer spiking neural encoder-decoder that employs the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for efficient encoding and classification. This work integrates the strengths of both PointNet and LCA, enhancing computational efficiency and energy performance on edge devices. PointLCA-Net achieves high recognition accuracy for spatio-temporal data with substantially lower energy burden during both inference and training than comparable approaches, thus advancing the deployment of advanced neural architectures in energy-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2411.00140</p></details> |

However, real-world visual relationships often exhibit a long-tailed distribution, causing existing methods for tasks like Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) and Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) to produce biased scene graphs. To this end, we propose ImparTail, a novel training framework that leverages curriculum learning and loss masking to mitigate bias in the generation and anticipation of spatio-temporal scene graphs. Our approach gradually decreases the dominance of the head relationship classes during training and focuses more on tail classes, leading to more balanced training. Furthermore, we introduce two new tasks, Robust Spatio-Temporal Scene Graph Generation and Robust Scene Graph Anticipation, designed to evaluate the robustness of STSG models against distribution shifts. Extensive experiments on the Action Genome dataset demonstrate that our framework significantly enhances the unbiased performance and robustness of STSG models compared to existing methods.</p></details> | Under review |

Traditional approaches have relied on separate models tailored to either grid-based data, representing cities as uniform cells, or graph-based data, modeling cities as networks of nodes and edges. In this paper, we build UniFlow, a foundational model for general urban flow prediction that unifies both grid-based and graphbased data. We first design a multi-view spatio-temporal patching mechanism to standardize different data into a consistent sequential format and then introduce a spatio-temporal transformer architecture to capture complex correlations and dynamics. To leverage shared spatio-temporal patterns across different data types and facilitate effective cross-learning, we propose SpatioTemporal Memory Retrieval Augmentation (ST-MRA). By creating structured memory modules to store shared spatio-temporal patterns, ST-MRA enhances predictions through adaptive memory retrieval. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniFlow outperforms existing models in both grid-based and graph-based flow prediction, excelling particularly in scenarios with limited data availability, showcasing its superior performance and broad applicability. The datasets and code implementation have been released on https://github.com/YuanYuan98/UniFlow.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches often produce overly conservative uncertainty intervals at individual spatial units and fail to properly capture uncertainties when aggregating predictions across different spatial scales. This paper presents a novel hierarchical spatio-temporal model based on the conformal prediction framework to address these challenges. Our approach generates circuit-level DER growth predictions and efficiently aggregates them to the substation level while maintaining statistical validity through a tailored non-conformity score. Applied to a decade of DER installation data from a local utility network, our method demonstrates superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in reducing prediction interval widths while maintaining coverage.</p></details> |  |

Our primary contribution is the design of a polynomial time $(0,\epsilon)$-additive bicriteria approximation algorithm for finding optimal constrained policies across a broad class of recursively computable constraints, including almost-sure, chance, expectation, and their anytime variants. Matching lower bounds imply our approximation guarantees are optimal so long as $P \neq NP$. The generality of our approach results in answers to several long-standing open complexity questions in the constrained reinforcement learning literature. Specifically, we are the first to prove polynomial-time approximability for the following settings: policies under chance constraints, deterministic policies under multiple expectation constraints, policies under non-homogeneous constraints (i.e., constraints of different types), and policies under constraints for continuous-state processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[EIQP: Execution-time-certified and Infeasibility-detecting QP Solver](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07738v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving real-time quadratic programming (QP) is a ubiquitous task in control engineering, such as in model predictive control and control barrier function-based QP. In such real-time scenarios, certifying that the employed QP algorithm can either return a solution within a predefined level of optimality or detect QP infeasibility before the predefined sampling time is a pressing requirement. This article considers convex QP and adopts its homogeneous formulation to achieve infeasibility detection. Exploiting this homogeneous formulation, this article proposes a novel infeasible interior-point method (IPM) algorithm with the best theoretical $O(\sqrt{n})$ iteration complexity that feasible IPM algorithms enjoy. The iteration complexity is proved to be \textit{exact} (rather than an upper bound), \textit{simple to calculate}, and \textit{data independent}, with the value $\left\lceil\frac{\log(\frac{n+1}{\epsilon})}{-\log(1-\frac{0.414213}{\sqrt{n+1}})}\right\rceil$ (where $n$ and $\epsilon$ denote the number of constraints and the predefined optimality level, respectively), making it appealing to certify the execution time of online time-varying convex QPs. The proposed algorithm is simple to implement without requiring a line search procedure (uses the full Newton step), and its C-code implementation (offering MATLAB, Julia, and Python interfaces) and numerical examples are publicly available at https://github.com/liangwu2019/EIQP.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[DPCore: Dynamic Prompt Coreset for Continual Test-Time Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10737v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) seeks to adapt source pre-trained models to continually changing, unseen target domains. While existing CTTA methods assume structured domain changes with uniform durations, real-world environments often exhibit dynamic patterns where domains recur with varying frequencies and durations. Current approaches, which adapt the same parameters across different domains, struggle in such dynamic conditions-they face convergence issues with brief domain exposures, risk forgetting previously learned knowledge, or misapplying it to irrelevant domains. To remedy this, we propose DPCore, a method designed for robust performance across diverse domain change patterns while ensuring computational efficiency. DPCore integrates three key components: Visual Prompt Adaptation for efficient domain alignment, a Prompt Coreset for knowledge preservation, and a Dynamic Update mechanism that intelligently adjusts existing prompts for similar domains while creating new ones for substantially different domains.

Causality requires that causes precede effects in time, meaning that the causal relationships between variables in one time order may not be the same in another. Therefore, any causal model requires temporal qualification; this applies even if the model does not describe a time series of repeated measurements. We formalize a notion of time for causal variables and argue that it resolves existing ambiguity in causal DAGs and is essential to assessing the validity of the acyclicity assumption. If variables are separated in time, their causal relationship is necessarily acyclic. Otherwise, acyclicity depends on the absence of any causal cycles permitted by the time order. We introduce a formal distinction between these two conditions and lay out their respective implications. We outline connections of our contribution with different strands of the broader causality literature and discuss the ramifications of considering time for the interpretation and applicability of DAGs as causal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Financial Time-Series Forecasting with Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05878v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stock movement prediction, a critical task in financial time-series forecasting, relies on identifying and retrieving key influencing factors from vast and complex datasets. However, traditional text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods often struggle to handle the intricacies of financial data. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B large language model (StockLLM) as its backbone, a novel candidate selection method enhanced by LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes the similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. These advancements enable our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while effectively minimizing noise in complex financial datasets. To support robust evaluation, we also construct new datasets that integrate financial indicators and historical stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms both the baseline StockLLM and random retrieval methods, showcasing its effectiveness. FinSeer, as the retriever, achieves an 8% higher accuracy on the BIGDATA22 benchmark and retrieves more impactful sequences compared to existing retrieval methods. This work highlights the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel, scalable framework for future research in the field.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

However, its connection with the training of generative models remains largely under-explored. In this paper, we show that the evolution of time-varying generative models can be projected onto an exponential family manifold, naturally creating a link between the parameters of a generative model and those of a probabilistic model. We then train the generative model by moving its projection on the manifold according to the natural gradient descent scheme. This approach also allows us to approximate the natural gradient of the KL divergence efficiently without relying on MCMC for intractable models. Furthermore, we propose particle versions of the algorithm, which feature closed-form update rules for any parametric model within the exponential family. Through toy and real-world experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Timing Residuals: Advancing PET Detectors with Explicit TOF Corrections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07630v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>PET is a functional imaging method that visualizes metabolic processes. TOF information can be derived from coincident detector signals and incorporated into image reconstruction to enhance the SNR. PET detectors are typically assessed by their CTR, but timing performance is degraded by various factors. Research on timing calibration seeks to mitigate these degradations and restore accurate timing information. While many calibration methods use analytical approaches, machine learning techniques have recently gained attention due to their flexibility. We developed a residual physics-based calibration approach that combines prior domain knowledge with the power of machine learning models. This approach begins with an initial analytical calibration addressing first-order skews. The remaining deviations, regarded as residual effects, are used to train machine learning models to eliminate higher-order skews. The key advantage is that the experimenter guides the learning process through the definition of timing residuals. In earlier studies, we developed models that directly predicted the expected time difference, which offered corrections only implicitly (implicit correction models). In this study, we introduce a new definition for timing residuals, enabling us to train models that directly predict correction values (explicit correction models). The explicit correction approach significantly simplifies data acquisition, improves linearity, and enhances timing performance from $371 \pm 6$ ps to $281 \pm 5$ ps for coincidences from 430 keV to 590 keV. Additionally, the new definition reduces model size, making it suitable for high-throughput applications like PET scanners. Experiments were conducted using two detector stacks composed of $4 \times 4$ LYSO:Ce,Ca crystals ($3.8\times 3.8\times 20$ mm$^{3}$) coupled to $4 \times 4$ Broadcom NUV-MT SiPMs and digitized with the TOFPET2 ASIC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Prompting: Time2Lang -- Bridging Time-Series Foundation Models and Large Language Models for Health Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07608v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at CHIL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Distributed Coverage Control for Time-Varying Spatial Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07595v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot systems are essential for environmental monitoring, particularly for tracking spatial phenomena like pollution, soil minerals, and water salinity, and more. This study addresses the challenge of deploying a multi-robot team for optimal coverage in environments where the density distribution, describing areas of interest, is unknown and changes over time. We propose a fully distributed control strategy that uses Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the spatial field and balance the trade-off between learning the field and optimally covering it. Unlike existing approaches, we address a more realistic scenario by handling time-varying spatial fields, where the exploration-exploitation trade-off is dynamically adjusted over time. Each robot operates locally, using only its own collected data and the information shared by the neighboring robots. To address the computational limits of GPs, the algorithm efficiently manages the volume of data by selecting only the most relevant samples for the process estimation. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated through several simulations and experiments, incorporating real-world data phenomena to validate its effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChameleonLLM: Batch-Aware Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation via Inference-Time Clusters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04315v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance across diverse tasks. However, these models are typically deployed with fixed weights, which limits their ability to adapt dynamically to the variability inherent in real-world data during inference. This paper introduces ChameleonLLM, a novel framework that enables inference-time adaptation of LLMs by leveraging batch-aware clustering and on-the-fly generation of low-rank updates. Unlike traditional fine-tuning approaches such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) or methods that rely on a fixed set of pre-learned uniforms (changeable masks), our method dynamically generates adaptive modifications to the decoder weights based on the aggregated statistics of clustered batches. By intelligently grouping similar inputs and computing context-aware low-rank updates via a hyper-network, ChameleonLLM achieves significant performance gains, outperforming conventional LoRA methods while eliminating the overhead of maintaining multiple expert models. Our experiments highlight the potential of our approach to serve as a versatile and highly adaptive solution for language model inference. ChameleonLLM is open-sourced to ensure the reproducibility of our experiments: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ChamaleonLLM/</p></details> |  |

The state constraint is given by an L2 functional in space, which is required to fulfill a pointwise bound in time. The discretization scheme for the Stokes equations consists of inf-sup stable finite elements in space and a discontinuous Galerkin method in time, for which we have recently established best approximation type error estimates. Using these error estimates, for the discrete control problem we establish error estimates and as a by-product we show an improved regularity for the optimal control. We complement our theoretical analysis with numerical results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added some references and another Numerical example with simultaneous control- and state constraint</p></details> |
| **[Physiome-ODE: A Benchmark for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Based on Biological ODEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07489v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art methods for forecasting irregularly sampled time series with missing values predominantly rely on just four datasets and a few small toy examples for evaluation. While ordinary differential equations (ODE) are the prevalent models in science and engineering, a baseline model that forecasts a constant value outperforms ODE-based models from the last five years on three of these existing datasets. This unintuitive finding hampers further research on ODE-based models, a more plausible model family. In this paper, we develop a methodology to generate irregularly sampled multivariate time series (IMTS) datasets from ordinary differential equations and to select challenging instances via rejection sampling. Using this methodology, we create Physiome-ODE, a large and sophisticated benchmark of IMTS datasets consisting of 50 individual datasets, derived from real-world ordinary differential equations from research in biology. Physiome-ODE is the first benchmark for IMTS forecasting that we are aware of and an order of magnitude larger than the current evaluation setting of four datasets. Using our benchmark Physiome-ODE, we show qualitatively completely different results than those derived from the current four datasets: on Physiome-ODE ODE-based models can play to their strength and our benchmark can differentiate in a meaningful way between different IMTS forecasting models. This way, we expect to give a new impulse to research on ODE-based time series modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Variable Multiple Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap for Time Series with Multiple Periodic Correlations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07462v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a novel block bootstrap method for time series with multiple periodically correlated (MPC) components called the Variable Multiple Bandpass Periodic Block Bootstrap (VMBPBB). While past methodological advancements permitted bootstrapping time series to preserve certain correlations, and then periodically correlated (PC) structures, there does not appear to be adequate or efficient methods to bootstrap estimate the sampling distribution of estimators for MPC time series. Current methods that preserve the PC correlation structure resample the original time series, selecting block size to preserve one PC component frequency while simultaneously and unnecessarily resampling all frequencies. This destroys PC components at other frequencies. VMBPBB uses bandpass filters to separate each PC component, creating a set of PC component time series each composed principally of one component. VMBPBB then resamples each PC component time series, not the original MPC time series, with the respective block size preserving the correlation structure of each PC component. Finally, VMBPBB aggregates the PC component bootstraps to form a bootstrap of the MPC time series, successfully preserving all correlations. A simulation study across a wide range of different MPC component frequencies and signal-to-noise ratios is presented and reveals that VMBPBB almost universally outperforms existing methods that fail to bandpass filter the MPC time series.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2402.03491</p></details> |
| **[PSformer: Parameter-efficient Transformer with Segment Attention for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01419v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across various domains, often complicated by high-dimensional data and long-term dependencies. This paper presents a novel transformer architecture for time series forecasting, incorporating two key innovations: parameter sharing (PS) and Spatial-Temporal Segment Attention (SegAtt). We also define the time series segment as the concatenation of sequence patches from the same positions across different variables. The proposed model, PSformer, reduces the number of training parameters through the parameter sharing mechanism, thereby improving model efficiency and scalability. The introduction of SegAtt could enhance the capability of capturing local spatio-temporal dependencies by computing attention over the segments, and improve global representation by integrating information across segments. The combination of parameter sharing and SegAtt significantly improves the forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that PSformer outperforms popular baselines and other transformer-based approaches in terms of accuracy and scalability, establishing itself as an accurate and scalable tool for time series forecasting.</p></details> | 30 pages |

While often demonstrating promising results, the transformer architecture encounters challenges in fully exploiting the temporal relations within time series data due to its attention mechanism. In this work, we design eXponential Patch (xPatch for short), a novel dual-stream architecture that utilizes exponential decomposition. Inspired by the classical exponential smoothing approaches, xPatch introduces the innovative seasonal-trend exponential decomposition module. Additionally, we propose a dual-flow architecture that consists of an MLP-based linear stream and a CNN-based non-linear stream. This model investigates the benefits of employing patching and channel-independence techniques within a non-transformer model. Finally, we develop a robust arctangent loss function and a sigmoid learning rate adjustment scheme, which prevent overfitting and boost forecasting performance.

| **[Are KANs Effective for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11306v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting is a crucial task that predicts the future states based on historical inputs. Related techniques have been developing in parallel with the machine learning community, from early statistical learning methods to current deep learning methods. Despite their significant advancements, existing methods continue to struggle with the challenge of inadequate interpretability. The rise of the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) provides a new perspective to solve this challenge, but current work has not yet concluded whether KAN is effective in time series forecasting tasks. In this paper, we aim to evaluate the effectiveness of KANs in time-series forecasting from the perspectives of performance, integrability, efficiency, and interpretability. To this end, we propose the Multi-layer Mixture-of-KAN network (MMK), which achieves excellent performance while retaining KAN's ability to be transformed into a combination of symbolic functions. The core module of MMK is the mixture-of-KAN layer, which uses a mixture-of-experts structure to assign variables to best-matched KAN experts. Then, we explore some useful experimental strategies to deal with the issues in the training stage. Finally, we compare MMK and various baselines on seven datasets. Extensive experimental and visualization results demonstrate that KANs are effective in multivariate time series forecasting.

| **[TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04442v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term relationships. Most existing methods either eliminate or retain non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term cointegration across variates. Extensive experiments show that TimeBridge consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Additionally, TimeBridge demonstrates exceptional performance in financial forecasting on the CSI 500 and S&P 500 indices, further validating its robustness and effectiveness.

Thus, any EMA study must have a missing data plan. In this paper, we discuss missingness in time series analysis and the appropriate way to handle missing data when the data is modeled as an idiographic discrete time continuous measure state-space model. We found that Missing Completely At Random, Missing At Random, and Time-dependent Missing At Random data have less bias and variability than Autoregressive Time-dependent Missing At Random and Missing Not At Random. The Kalman filter excelled at handling missing data under most conditions. Contrary to the literature, we found that, using a variety of methods, multiple imputation struggled to recover the parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bag of Tricks for Inference-time Computation of LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07191v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), solving complex reasoning tasks has gained increasing attention. Inference-time computation methods (e.g., Best-of-N, beam search, et al.) are particularly valuable as they can enhance reasoning performance without modifying model parameters or requiring additional training. However, these techniques come with implementation challenges, and most existing methods remain at the proof-of-concept stage with limited practical adoption due to their computational complexity and varying effectiveness across different tasks. In this paper, we investigate and benchmark diverse inference-time computation strategies across reasoning tasks of varying complexity. Since most current methods rely on a proposer-verifier pipeline that first generates candidate solutions (e.g., reasoning solutions) and then selects the best one based on reward signals (e.g., RLHF rewards, process rewards), our research focuses on optimizing both candidate solution generation (e.g., instructing prompts, hyperparameters such as temperature and top-p) and reward mechanisms (e.g., self-evaluation, reward types). Through extensive experiments (more than 20,000 A100-80G GPU hours with over 1,000 experiments) across a variety of models (e.g., Llama, Qwen, and Mistral families) of various sizes, our ablation studies reveal that previously overlooked strategies can significantly enhance performance (e.g., tuning temperature can improve reasoning task performance by up to 5%). Furthermore, we establish a standardized benchmark for inference-time computation by systematically evaluating six representative methods across eight reasoning tasks. These findings provide a stronger foundation for future research. The code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/benchmark_inference_time_computation_LL</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TimeDiT, a diffusion transformer model that synergistically combines transformer-based temporal dependency learning with diffusion-based probabilistic sampling. TimeDiT employs a unified masking mechanism to harmonize the training and inference process across diverse tasks while introducing a theoretically grounded, finetuning-free model editing strategy that enables flexible integration of external knowledge during sampling. Acknowledging the challenges of unifying multiple downstream tasks under a single model, our systematic evaluation demonstrates TimeDiT's effectiveness both in fundamental tasks, i.e., forecasting and imputation, through zero-shot/fine-tuning; and in domain tasks, i.e., multi-resolution forecasting, anomaly detection, and data generation, establishing it as a \textit{proto-foundation model} that bridges the gap between general-purpose and domain-specific models.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages, 11 Figures, 22 Tables.

This raises a critical question: how should model training be modified to optimize performance under a subsequent test-time compute strategy and budget? To explore this, we focus on pass@N, a simple test-time strategy that searches for a correct answer in $N$ independent samples. We show, surprisingly, that training with cross-entropy (CE) loss can be ${\it misaligned}$ with pass@N in that pass@N accuracy ${\it decreases}$ with longer training. We explain the origins of this misalignment in terms of model overconfidence induced by CE, and experimentally verify our prediction of overconfidence as an impediment to scaling test-time compute via pass@N. Furthermore we suggest a principled, modified training loss that is better aligned to pass@N by limiting model confidence and rescuing pass@N test performance. Our algorithm demonstrates improved mathematical reasoning on MATH and MiniF2F benchmarks under several scenarios: (1) providing answers to math questions; and (2) proving theorems by searching over proof trees of varying shapes. Overall our work underscores the importance of co-designing two traditionally separate phases of LLM development: training-time protocols and test-time search and reasoning strategies.</p></details> |  |

First, a convex mathematical model of W2H-CI is developed. Then, an optimization model for optimal operation of W2H-CI, which is a large-scale mixed-integer convex program (MICP), is proposed. Moreover, we propose to solve this problem in real-time in order to hedge against the uncertainty of wind power. For this purpose, a novel solution method based on active constraints identification and integer variable prediction is introduced. This method can solve MICP problems very fast since it uses historical optimization data to predict the values of binary variables and a limited number of constraints which most likely contain all active constraints. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed fast solution method using two W2H-CI case studies.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 Figures |
| **[GenARM: Reward Guided Generation with Autoregressive Reward Model for Test-time Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08193v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but require careful alignment with human preferences. Traditional training-time methods finetune LLMs using human preference datasets but incur significant training costs and require repeated training to handle diverse user preferences. Test-time alignment methods address this by using reward models (RMs) to guide frozen LLMs without retraining. However, existing test-time approaches rely on trajectory-level RMs which are designed to evaluate complete responses, making them unsuitable for autoregressive text generation that requires computing next-token rewards from partial responses. To address this, we introduce GenARM, a test-time alignment approach that leverages the Autoregressive Reward Model--a novel reward parametrization designed to predict next-token rewards for efficient and effective autoregressive generation. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this parametrization can provably guide frozen LLMs toward any distribution achievable by traditional RMs within the KL-regularized reinforcement learning framework. Experimental results show that GenARM significantly outperforms prior test-time alignment baselines and matches the performance of training-time methods. Additionally, GenARM enables efficient weak-to-strong guidance, aligning larger LLMs with smaller RMs without the high costs of training larger models. Furthermore, GenARM supports multi-objective alignment, allowing real-time trade-offs between preference dimensions and catering to diverse user preferences without retraining.

We present a novel framework using Markovian Gaussian Processes to learn brain communications with time-varying temporal delays from multi-region neural recordings, named Adaptive Delay Model (ADM). Our method combines Gaussian Processes with State Space Models and employs parallel scan inference algorithms, enabling efficient scaling to large datasets while identifying concurrent communication patterns that evolve over time. This time-varying approach captures how brain region interactions shift dynamically during cognitive processes. Validated on synthetic and multi-region neural recordings datasets, our approach discovers both the directionality and temporal dynamics of neural communication. This work advances our understanding of distributed neural computation and provides a scalable tool for analyzing dynamic brain networks.</p></details> |  |

We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method, considering the computational and communication limitations of WSN nodes. This comparative study provides insights for selecting the most appropriate ASR implementation strategy based on specific application requirements and resource constraints.</p></details> |  |

While traditional planners and classical optimisation methods have been extensively used to address this dynamic problem, they often face real-time, unpredictable changes that ultimately leads to sub-optimal performance in terms of adaptiveness and real-time decision making. In this work, we propose a novel motion planner, AgilePilot, based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) that is trained in dynamic conditions, coupled with real-time Computer Vision (CV) for object detections during flight. The training-to-deployment framework bridges the Sim2Real gap, leveraging sophisticated reward structures that promotes both safety and agility depending upon environment conditions. The system can rapidly adapt to changing environments, while achieving a maximum speed of 3.0 m/s in real-world scenarios. In comparison, our approach outperforms classical algorithms such as Artificial Potential Field (APF) based motion planner by 3 times, both in performance and tracking accuracy of dynamic targets by using velocity predictions while exhibiting 90% success rate in 75 conducted experiments. This work highlights the effectiveness of DRL in tackling real-time dynamic navigation challenges, offering intelligent safety and agility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript has been submitted to 2025 INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (ICUAS)</p></details> |

Rethinking Compute-Optimal Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06703v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Time Scaling (TTS) is an important method for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) by using additional computation during the inference phase. However, current studies do not systematically analyze how policy models, Process Reward Models (PRMs), and problem difficulty influence TTS. This lack of analysis limits the understanding and practical use of TTS methods. In this paper, we focus on two core questions: (1) What is the optimal approach to scale test-time computation across different policy models, PRMs, and problem difficulty levels? (2) To what extent can extended computation improve the performance of LLMs on complex tasks, and can smaller language models outperform larger ones through this approach? Through comprehensive experiments on MATH-500 and challenging AIME24 tasks, we have the following observations: (1) The compute-optimal TTS strategy is highly dependent on the choice of policy model, PRM, and problem difficulty. (2) With our compute-optimal TTS strategy, extremely small policy models can outperform larger models. For example, a 1B LLM can exceed a 405B LLM on MATH-500. Moreover, on both MATH-500 and AIME24, a 0.5B LLM outperforms GPT-4o, a 3B LLM surpasses a 405B LLM, and a 7B LLM beats o1 and DeepSeek-R1, while with higher inference efficiency. These findings show the significance of adapting TTS strategies to the specific characteristics of each task and model and indicate that TTS is a promising approach for enhancing the reasoning abilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, both approaches are computationally expensive and slow, often requiring significant resources to generate a single successful attack. We hypothesize that the inefficiency of these methods arises from an inadequate characterization of the jailbreak problem itself. To address this gap, we approach the jailbreak problem as an alignment problem, leading us to propose LIAR (Leveraging Inference time Alignment to jailbReak), a fast and efficient best-of-N approach tailored for jailbreak attacks. LIAR offers several key advantages: it eliminates the need for additional training, operates in a fully black-box setting, significantly reduces computational overhead, and produces more human-readable adversarial prompts while maintaining competitive attack success rates. Our results demonstrate that a best-of-N approach is a simple yet highly effective strategy for evaluating the robustness of aligned LLMs, achieving attack success rates (ASR) comparable to state-of-the-art methods while offering a 10x improvement in perplexity and a significant speedup in Time-to-Attack, reducing execution time from tens of hours to seconds. Additionally, We also provide sub-optimality guarantees for the proposed LIAR. Our work highlights the potential of efficient, alignment-based jailbreak strategies for assessing and stress-testing AI safety measures.</p></details> |  |

This setting leads to unobserved degrees of freedom, which we handle using joint state and parameter estimation. Our method finds the states and parameters as the solution to a nonlinear least squares optimization problem based on the inverse dynamics and the observation error. The solution is found using a Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm with derivatives from automatic differentiation and custom differentiation rules for the complementary conditions that appear due to dry frictional constraints. We reduce the number of method parameters to the choice of the time-step, regularization coefficients, and a parameter that controls the relative weighting of inverse dynamics and observation errors. We evaluate the method using synthetic and real measured data, focusing on performance and sensitivity to method parameters. In particular, we optimize over a 13-dimensional parameter space, including inertial, frictional, tilt, and motor parameters, using data from a real Furuta pendulum. Results show fast convergence, in the order of seconds, and good agreement for different time-series of recorded data over multiple method parameter choices. However, very stiff constraints may cause difficulties in solving the optimization problem. We conclude that our method can be very fast and has method parameters that are robust and easy to set in the tested scenarios.</p></details> | 49 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets for Time-series Joint Alignment and Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06591v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-series analysis, nonlinear temporal misalignment remains a pivotal challenge that forestalls even simple averaging. Since its introduction, the Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Net (DTAN), which we first introduced (Weber et al., 2019) and further developed in (Weber & Freifeld, 2023), has proven itself as an effective solution for this problem (these conference papers are earlier partial versions of the current manuscript). DTAN predicts and applies diffeomorphic transformations in an input-dependent manner, thus facilitating the joint alignment (JA) and averaging of time-series ensembles in an unsupervised or a weakly-supervised manner. The inherent challenges of the weakly/unsupervised setting, particularly the risk of trivial solutions through excessive signal distortion, are mitigated using either one of two distinct strategies: 1) a regularization term for warps; 2) using the Inverse Consistency Averaging Error (ICAE). The latter is a novel, regularization-free approach which also facilitates the JA of variable-length signals. We also further extend our framework to incorporate multi-task learning (MT-DTAN), enabling simultaneous time-series alignment and classification. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different backbone architectures, demonstrating their efficacy in time-series alignment tasks. Finally, we showcase the utility of our approach in enabling Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for misaligned time-series data. Extensive experiments across 128 UCR datasets validate the superiority of our approach over contemporary averaging methods, including both traditional and learning-based approaches, marking a significant advancement in the field of time-series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript covers and extends the papers: Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets (DTAN; NeruIPS 2019) and Regularization-free Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets (ICML 2023).

| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning based Triggering Function for Early Classifiers of Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06584v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS) has been recognized as an important problem in many areas where decisions have to be taken as soon as possible, before the full data availability, while time pressure increases. Numerous ECTS approaches have been proposed, based on different triggering functions, each taking into account various pieces of information related to the incoming time series and/or the output of a classifier. Although their performances have been empirically compared in the literature, no studies have been carried out on the optimality of these triggering functions that involve ``man-tailored'' decision rules. Based on the same information, could there be better triggering functions? This paper presents one way to investigate this question by showing first how to translate ECTS problems into Reinforcement Learning (RL) ones, where the very same information is used in the state space. A thorough comparison of the performance obtained by ``handmade'' approaches and their ``RL-based'' counterparts has been carried out. A second question investigated in this paper is whether a different combination of information, defining the state space in RL systems, can achieve even better performance. Experiments show that the system we describe, called \textsc{Alert}, significantly outperforms its state-of-the-art competitors on a large number of datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Scatter Matrix Estimation for Elliptical Distributions in Polynomial Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06564v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of computationally efficient robust estimation of scatter matrices of elliptical distributions under the strong contamination model. We design polynomial time algorithms that achieve dimension-independent error in Frobenius norm. Our first result is a sequence of efficient algorithms that approaches nearly optimal error. Specifically, under a mild assumption on the eigenvalues of the scatter matrix $\Sigma$, for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, we design an estimator that, given $n = d^{O(t)}$ samples, in time $n^{O(t)}$ finds $\hat{\Sigma}$ such that $ \Vert{\Sigma^{-1/2}\, ({\hat{\Sigma} - \Sigma})\, \Sigma^{-1/2}}\Vert_{\text{F}} \le O(t \cdot \varepsilon^{1-\frac{1}{t}})$, where $\varepsilon$ is the fraction of corruption. We do not require any assumptions on the moments of the distribution, while all previously known computationally efficient algorithms for robust covariance/scatter estimation with dimension-independent error rely on strong assumptions on the moments, such as sub-Gaussianity or (certifiable) hypercontractivity. Furthermore, under a stronger assumption on the eigenvalues of $\Sigma$ (that, in particular, is satisfied by all matrices with constant condition number), we provide a fast (sub-quadratic in the input size) algorithm that, given nearly optimal number of samples $n = \tilde{O}(d^2/\varepsilon)$, in time $\tilde{O}({nd^2 poly(1/\varepsilon)})$ finds $\hat{\Sigma}$ such that $\Vert\hat{\Sigma} - \Sigma\Vert_{\text{F}} \le O(\Vert{\Sigma}\Vert \cdot \sqrt{\varepsilon})$. Our approach is based on robust covariance estimation of the spatial sign (the projection onto the sphere of radius $\sqrt{d}$) of elliptical distributions.</p></details> |  |

A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting. Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between normal and anomalous patterns effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication and presentation at the 2025 IEEE International systems Conference (SysCon)</p></details> |
| **[TivNe-SLAM: Dynamic Mapping and Tracking via Time-Varying Neural Radiance Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18917v7)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous attempts to integrate Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) into the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) framework either rely on the assumption of static scenes or require the ground truth camera poses, which impedes their application in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a time-varying representation to track and reconstruct the dynamic scenes. Firstly, two processes, a tracking process and a mapping process, are maintained simultaneously in our framework. In the tracking process, all input images are uniformly sampled and then progressively trained in a self-supervised paradigm. In the mapping process, we leverage motion masks to distinguish dynamic objects from the static background, and sample more pixels from dynamic areas. Secondly, the parameter optimization for both processes is comprised of two stages: the first stage associates time with 3D positions to convert the deformation field to the canonical field. The second stage associates time with the embeddings of the canonical field to obtain colors and a Signed Distance Function (SDF). Lastly, we propose a novel keyframe selection strategy based on the overlapping rate. Our approach is evaluated on two synthetic datasets and one real-world dataset, and the experiments validate that our method achieves competitive results in both tracking and mapping when compared to existing state-of-the-art NeRF-based dynamic SLAM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Data Augmentation for Few-Shot Time Series Forecasting: A Reinforcement Learning Approach Guided by a Model Zoo](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06282v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series forecasting, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios, is challenging due to the limited availability of high-quality training data. To address this, we present a pilot study on using reinforcement learning (RL) for time series data augmentation. Our method, ReAugment, tackles three critical questions: which parts of the training set should be augmented, how the augmentation should be performed, and what advantages RL brings to the process. Specifically, our approach maintains a forecasting model zoo, and by measuring prediction diversity across the models, we identify samples with higher probabilities for overfitting and use them as the anchor points for augmentation. Leveraging RL, our method adaptively transforms the overfit-prone samples into new data that not only enhances training set diversity but also directs the augmented data to target regions where the forecasting models are prone to overfitting. We validate the effectiveness of ReAugment across a wide range of base models, showing its advantages in both standard time series forecasting and few-shot learning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inference-Time Selective Debiasing to Enhance Fairness in Text Classification Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19345v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose selective debiasing -- an inference-time safety mechanism designed to enhance the overall model quality in terms of prediction performance and fairness, especially in scenarios where retraining the model is impractical. The method draws inspiration from selective classification, where at inference time, predictions with low quality, as indicated by their uncertainty scores, are discarded. In our approach, we identify the potentially biased model predictions and, instead of discarding them, we remove bias from these predictions using LEACE -- a post-processing debiasing method. To select problematic predictions, we propose a bias quantification approach based on KL divergence, which achieves better results than standard uncertainty quantification methods. Experiments on text classification datasets with encoder-based classification models demonstrate that selective debiasing helps to reduce the performance gap between post-processing methods and debiasing techniques from the at-training and pre-processing categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning in Zero-Sum Markov Games: Relaxing Strong Reachability and Mixing Time Assumptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08008v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address payoff-based decentralized learning in infinite-horizon zero-sum Markov games. In this setting, each player makes decisions based solely on received rewards, without observing the opponent's strategy or actions nor sharing information. Prior works established finite-time convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium under strong reachability and mixing time assumptions. We propose a convergent algorithm that significantly relaxes these assumptions, requiring only the existence of a single policy (not necessarily known) with bounded reachability and mixing time. Our key technical novelty is introducing Tsallis entropy regularization to smooth the best-response policy updates. By suitably tuning this regularization, we ensure sufficient exploration, thus bypassing previous stringent assumptions on the MDP. By establishing novel properties of the value and policy updates induced by the Tsallis entropy regularizer, we prove finite-time convergence to an approximate Nash equilibrium.</p></details> |  |
| **[Factor Modelling for Biclustering Large-dimensional Matrix-valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06397v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel unsupervised learning method is proposed in this paper for biclustering large-dimensional matrix-valued time series based on an entirely new latent two-way factor structure. Each block cluster is characterized by its own row and column cluster-specific factors in addition to some common matrix factors which impact on all the matrix time series. We first estimate the global loading spaces by projecting the observation matrices onto the row or column loading space corresponding to common factors. The loading spaces for cluster-specific factors are then further recovered by projecting the observation matrices onto the orthogonal complement space of the estimated global loading spaces. To identify the latent row/column clusters simultaneously for matrix-valued time series, we provide a $K$-means algorithm based on the estimated row/column factor loadings of the cluster-specific weak factors. Theoretically, we derive faster convergence rates for global loading matrices than those of the state-of-the-art methods available in the literature under mild conditions. We also propose an one-pass eigenvalue-ratio method to estimate the numbers of global and cluster-specific factors. The consistency with explicit convergence rates is also established for the estimators of the local loading matrices, the factor numbers and the latent cluster memberships. Numerical experiments with both simulated data as well as a real data example are also reported to illustrate the usefulness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoodMem: Near Real-time and Precise Food Video Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12121v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Food segmentation, including in videos, is vital for addressing real-world health, agriculture, and food biotechnology issues. Current limitations lead to inaccurate nutritional analysis, inefficient crop management, and suboptimal food processing, impacting food security and public health. Improving segmentation techniques can enhance dietary assessments, agricultural productivity, and the food production process. This study introduces the development of a robust framework for high-quality, near-real-time segmentation and tracking of food items in videos, using minimal hardware resources. We present FoodMem, a novel framework designed to segment food items from video sequences of 360-degree unbounded scenes. FoodMem can consistently generate masks of food portions in a video sequence, overcoming the limitations of existing semantic segmentation models, such as flickering and prohibitive inference speeds in video processing contexts. To address these issues, FoodMem leverages a two-phase solution: a transformer segmentation phase to create initial segmentation masks and a memory-based tracking phase to monitor food masks in complex scenes. Our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art food segmentation models, yielding superior performance across various conditions, such as camera angles, lighting, reflections, scene complexity, and food diversity. This results in reduced segmentation noise, elimination of artifacts, and completion of missing segments. Here, we also introduce a new annotated food dataset encompassing challenging scenarios absent in previous benchmarks. Extensive experiments conducted on MetaFood3D, Nutrition5k, and Vegetables & Fruits datasets demonstrate that FoodMem enhances the state-of-the-art by 2.5% mean average precision in food video segmentation and is 58 x faster on average.</p></details> |  |

However, learning self-supervised representations for spatially characterised time series, like traffic interactions, poses challenges as it requires maintaining fine-grained similarity relations in the latent space. In this study, we incorporate two structure-preserving regularisers for the contrastive learning of spatial time series: one regulariser preserves the topology of similarities between instances, and the other preserves the graph geometry of similarities across spatial and temporal dimensions. To balance contrastive learning and structure preservation, we propose a dynamic mechanism that adaptively weighs the trade-off and stabilises training. We conduct experiments on multivariate time series classification, as well as macroscopic and microscopic traffic prediction. For all three tasks, our approach preserves the structures of similarity relations more effectively and improves state-of-the-art task performances. The proposed approach can be applied to an arbitrary encoder and is particularly beneficial for time series with spatial or geographical features. Furthermore, this study suggests that higher similarity structure preservation indicates more informative and useful representations. This may help to understand the contribution of representation learning in pattern recognition with neural networks. Our code is made openly accessible with all resulting data at https://github.com/yiru-jiao/spclt.</p></details> | <details><summary>TL;DR...</summary><p>TL;DR: Preserving certain structures of similarity relations in spatio-temporal data can improve downstream task performance via contrastive learning</p></details> |

Recent methods adopt learning-based approaches to implicitly capture priors, but the priors primarily fit in-domain data and do not generalize well to out-of-domain scenarios. To address this, we propose a zero-shot depth completion method composed of an affine-invariant depth diffusion model and test-time alignment. We use pre-trained depth diffusion models as depth prior knowledge, which implicitly understand how to fill in depth for scenes. Our approach aligns the affine-invariant depth prior with metric-scale sparse measurements, enforcing them as hard constraints via an optimization loop at test-time. Our zero-shot depth completion method demonstrates generalization across various domain datasets, achieving up to a 21\% average performance improvement over the previous state-of-the-art methods while enhancing spatial understanding by sharpening scene details. We demonstrate that aligning a monocular affine-invariant depth prior with sparse metric measurements is a proven strategy to achieve domain-generalizable depth completion without relying on extensive training data.

However, most existing methods rely on discrete-time representations and smoothness priors to infer a robot's motion states, which often struggle with ensuring multi-sensor data synchronization. In this paper, we present an efficient UWB-Inertial-odometer localization system, utilizing a non-uniform B-spline framework with fewer anchors. Unlike traditional uniform B-spline-based continuous-time methods, we introduce an adaptive knot-span adjustment strategy for non-uniform continuous-time trajectory representation. This is accomplished by adjusting control points dynamically based on movement speed. To enable efficient fusion of IMU and odometer data, we propose an improved Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) with innovation-based adaptive estimation to provide short-term accurate motion prior. Furthermore, to address the challenge of achieving a fully observable UWB localization system under few-anchor conditions, the Virtual Anchor (VA) generation method based on multiple hypotheses is proposed. At the backend, we propose a CT-UIO factor graph with an adaptive sliding window for global trajectory estimation. Comprehensive experiments conducted on corridor and exhibition hall datasets validate the proposed system's high precision and robust performance.

Existing fine-tuning methods often suffer from reward over-optimization, while approximate guidance approaches fail to optimize target rewards effectively. Addressing these limitations, we propose a training-free, test-time method based on Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to sample from the reward-aligned target distribution. Our approach, tailored for diffusion sampling and incorporating tempering techniques, achieves comparable or superior target rewards to fine-tuning methods while preserving diversity and cross-reward generalization. We demonstrate its effectiveness in single-reward optimization, multi-objective scenarios, and online black-box optimization. This work offers a robust solution for aligning diffusion models with diverse downstream objectives without compromising their general capabilities.

However, TPT cannot avoid the semantic gap between modalities while the support-set cannot be tuned. To this end, we draw on each other's strengths and propose a novel framework namely TEst-time Support-set Tuning for zero-shot Video Classification (TEST-V). It first dilates the support-set with multiple prompts (Multi-prompting Support-set Dilation, MSD) and then erodes the support-set via learnable weights to mine key cues dynamically (Temporal-aware Support-set Erosion, TSE). Specifically, i) MSD expands the support samples for each class based on multiple prompts enquired from LLMs to enrich the diversity of the support-set. ii) TSE tunes the support-set with factorized learnable weights according to the temporal prediction consistency in a self-supervised manner to dig pivotal supporting cues for each class. $\textbf{TEST-V}$ achieves state-of-the-art results across four benchmarks and has good interpretability for the support-set dilation and erosion.</p></details> |  |

However, whether generating ideas with the help of LLMs leads to idea fixation or idea expansion is unclear. This study examines how different timings of LLM usage - either at the beginning or after independent ideation - affect people's perceptions and ideation outcomes in a writing task. In a controlled experiment with 60 participants, we found that using LLMs from the beginning reduced the number of original ideas and lowered creative self-efficacy and self-credit, mediated by changes in autonomy and ownership. We discuss the challenges and opportunities associated with using LLMs to assist in idea generation. We propose delaying the use of LLMs to support ideation while considering users' self-efficacy, autonomy, and ownership of the ideation outcomes.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In scenarios such as household assistance and rescue, mobile robots need to understand a human command, such as "find a person wearing black". We present a novel vision-language navigation (VL-Nav) system that integrates efficient spatial reasoning on low-power robots. Unlike prior methods that rely on a single image-level feature similarity to guide a robot, our method integrates pixel-wise vision-language features with curiosity-driven exploration. This approach enables robust navigation to human-instructed instances across diverse environments. We deploy VL-Nav on a four-wheel mobile robot and evaluate its performance through comprehensive navigation tasks in both indoor and outdoor environments, spanning different scales and semantic complexities. Remarkably, VL-Nav operates at a real-time frequency of 30 Hz with a Jetson Orin NX, highlighting its ability to conduct efficient vision-language navigation. Results show that VL-Nav achieves an overall success rate of 86.3%, outperforming previous methods by 44.15%.</p></details> |  |

The problem is reformulated as an optimization problem using Tikhonov regularization. A space-time interface-fitted method is employed to discretize the advection-diffusion equation, where two second-order a priori error estimates are established with respect to the $L^2$-norms. Additionally, the regularized source is discretized sequentially using the variational approach, the element-wise constant discretization, and finally, the post-processing strategy. Optimal error estimates are achieved for the first two methods, while superlinear convergence is obtained for the third. Furthermore, a priori choices for the regularization parameter are proposed, depending on the mesh size and noise level. These choices ensure that the discrete and post-processing solutions strongly converge to the exact source as the mesh size and noise level tend to zero.</p></details> |  |

While textual inputs are often effectively safeguarded, adversarial visual inputs can easily bypass VLM defense mechanisms. Existing defense methods are either resource-intensive, requiring substantial data and compute, or fail to simultaneously ensure safety and usefulness in responses. To address these limitations, we propose a novel two-phase inference-time alignment framework, Evaluating Then Aligning (ETA): 1) Evaluating input visual contents and output responses to establish a robust safety awareness in multimodal settings, and 2) Aligning unsafe behaviors at both shallow and deep levels by conditioning the VLMs' generative distribution with an interference prefix and performing sentence-level best-of-N to search the most harmless and helpful generation paths. Extensive experiments show that ETA outperforms baseline methods in terms of harmlessness, helpfulness, and efficiency, reducing the unsafe rate by 87.5% in cross-modality attacks and achieving 96.6% win-ties in GPT-4 helpfulness evaluation.

We introduce Powerformer, a novel Transformer variant that replaces noncausal attention weights with causal weights that are reweighted according to a smooth heavy-tailed decay. This simple yet effective modification endows the model with an inductive bias favoring temporally local dependencies, while still allowing sufficient flexibility to learn the unique correlation structure of each dataset. Our empirical results demonstrate that Powerformer not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on public time-series benchmarks, but also that it offers improved interpretability of attention patterns. Our analyses show that the model's locality bias is amplified during training, demonstrating an interplay between time-series data and power-law-based attention. These findings highlight the importance of domain-specific modifications to the Transformer architecture for time-series forecasting, and they establish Powerformer as a strong, efficient, and principled baseline for future research and real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeKAN: KAN-based Frequency Decomposition Learning Architecture for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06910v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world time series often have multiple frequency components that are intertwined with each other, making accurate time series forecasting challenging. Decomposing the mixed frequency components into multiple single frequency components is a natural choice. However, the information density of patterns varies across different frequencies, and employing a uniform modeling approach for different frequency components can lead to inaccurate characterization. To address this challenges, inspired by the flexibility of the recent Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), we propose a KAN-based Frequency Decomposition Learning architecture (TimeKAN) to address the complex forecasting challenges caused by multiple frequency mixtures. Specifically, TimeKAN mainly consists of three components: Cascaded Frequency Decomposition (CFD) blocks, Multi-order KAN Representation Learning (M-KAN) blocks and Frequency Mixing blocks. CFD blocks adopt a bottom-up cascading approach to obtain series representations for each frequency band. Benefiting from the high flexibility of KAN, we design a novel M-KAN block to learn and represent specific temporal patterns within each frequency band. Finally, Frequency Mixing blocks is used to recombine the frequency bands into the original format. Extensive experimental results across multiple real-world time series datasets demonstrate that TimeKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance as an extremely lightweight architecture.

Existing methods typically adopt a single modeling perspective, either treating series data as sequences or transforming them into image representations for further classification. In this paper, we propose a joint learning framework that incorporates both sequence and image representations. We also design three self-supervised learning strategies to facilitate the fusion of sequence and image representations, capturing a more generalizable joint representation. The results indicate that our approach outperforms seven other state-of-the-art models in three representative real-world clinical datasets. We further validate our approach by simulating two major types of real-world missingness through leave-sensors-out and leave-samples-out techniques. The results demonstrate that our approach is more robust and significantly surpasses other baselines in terms of classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, AAAI2025</p></details> |
| **[TimeDART: A Diffusion Autoregressive Transformer for Self-Supervised Time Series Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05711v3)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning has garnered increasing attention in time series analysis for benefiting various downstream tasks and reducing reliance on labeled data. Despite its effectiveness, existing methods often struggle to comprehensively capture both long-term dynamic evolution and subtle local patterns in a unified manner. In this work, we propose TimeDART, a novel self-supervised time series pre-training framework that unifies two powerful generative paradigms to learn more transferable representations. Specifically, we first employ a causal Transformer encoder, accompanied by a patch-based embedding strategy, to model the evolving trends from left to right. Building on this global modeling, we further introduce a denoising diffusion process to capture fine-grained local patterns through forward diffusion and reverse denoising. Finally, we optimize the model in an autoregressive manner. As a result, TimeDART effectively accounts for both global and local sequence features in a coherent way. We conduct extensive experiments on public datasets for time series forecasting and classification. The experimental results demonstrate that TimeDART consistently outperforms previous compared methods, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Our code is available at https://github.com/Melmaphother/TimeDART.</p></details> | 22 pages, 8 figures |

However, the large size of point clouds poses challenges in terms of data storage and transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel point cloud compression and transmission framework for resource-constrained robotic applications, called RCPCC. We iteratively fit the surface of point clouds with a similar range value and eliminate redundancy through their spatial relationships. Then, we use Shape-adaptive DCT (SA-DCT) to transform the unfit points and reduce the data volume by quantizing the transformed coefficients. We design an adaptive bitrate control strategy based on QoE as the optimization goal to control the quality of the transmitted point cloud. Experiments show that our framework achieves compression rates of 40$\times$ to 80$\times$ while maintaining high accuracy for downstream applications. our method significantly outperforms other baselines in terms of accuracy when the compression rate exceeds 70$\times$. Furthermore, in situations of reduced communication bandwidth, our adaptive bitrate control strategy demonstrates significant QoE improvements. The code will be available at https://github.com/HITSZ-NRSL/RCPCC.git.</p></details> | ICRA 2025 accepted |
| **[A Novel Multi-Teacher Knowledge Distillation for Real-Time Object Detection using 4D Radar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06114v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D object detection is crucial for safe autonomous navigation, requiring reliable performance across diverse weather conditions. While LiDAR performance deteriorates in challenging weather, Radar systems maintain their reliability. Traditional Radars have limitations due to their lack of elevation data, but the recent 4D Radars overcome this by measuring elevation alongside range, azimuth, and Doppler velocity, making them invaluable for autonomous vehicles. The primary challenge in utilizing 4D Radars is the sparsity of their point clouds. Previous works address this by developing architectures that better capture semantics and context in sparse point cloud, largely drawing from LiDAR-based approaches. However, these methods often overlook a unique advantage of 4D Radars: the dense Radar tensor, which encapsulates power measurements across three spatial dimensions and the Doppler dimension. Our paper leverages this tensor to tackle the sparsity issue. We introduce a novel knowledge distillation framework that enables a student model to densify its sparse input in the latent space by emulating an ensemble of teacher models. Our experiments demonstrate a 25% performance improvement over the state-of-the-art RTNH model on the K-Radar dataset. Notably, this improvement is achieved while still maintaining a real-time inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Agnostic 3D Lifting in Space and Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01166v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a spatio-temporal perspective on category-agnostic 3D lifting of 2D keypoints over a temporal sequence. Our approach differs from existing state-of-the-art methods that are either: (i) object-agnostic, but can only operate on individual frames, or (ii) can model space-time dependencies, but are only designed to work with a single object category. Our approach is grounded in two core principles. First, general information about similar objects can be leveraged to achieve better performance when there is little object-specific training data. Second, a temporally-proximate context window is advantageous for achieving consistency throughout a sequence. These two principles allow us to outperform current state-of-the-art methods on per-frame and per-sequence metrics for a variety of animal categories. Lastly, we release a new synthetic dataset containing 3D skeletons and motion sequences for a variety of animal categories.</p></details> | 3DV 2025 |
| **[An adaptive filter bank based neural network approach for time delay estimation and speech enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06098v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time delay estimation (TDE) plays a key role in acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) using adaptive filter method. Considerable residual echo will be left if estimation error arises. Here, in this paper, we proposed an adaptive filter bank based neural network approach where the delay is estimated by a bank of adaptive filters with overlapped time scope, and all the energy of filter weights are concatenated and feed to a classification network. The index with maximal probability is chosen as the estimated delay. Based on this TDE, an AEC scheme is designed using a neural network for residual echo and noise suppression, and the optimally-modified log-spectral amplitude (OMLSA) algorithm is adopted to make it robust. Also, a robust automatic gain control (AGC) scheme with spectrum smoothing method is designed to amplify speech segments. Performance evaluations reveal that higher performance can be achieved for our scheme.</p></details> | audio 3A |
| **[Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06037v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed solely by memorizing training patterns, or do they possess the ability to reason? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 23 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning abilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, it is crucial to have tools that expose these editorial choices underlying media bias. In this paper, we introduce the Media Bias Detector, a tool for researchers, journalists, and news consumers. By integrating large language models, we provide near real-time granular insights into the topics, tone, political lean, and facts of news articles aggregated to the publisher level. We assessed the tool's impact by interviewing 13 experts from journalism, communications, and political science, revealing key insights into usability and functionality, practical applications, and AI's role in powering media bias tools. We explored this in more depth with a follow-up survey of 150 news consumers. This work highlights opportunities for AI-driven tools that empower users to critically engage with media content, particularly in politically charged environments.</p></details> |  |

However, time-aware datasets, particularly for persona-grounded conversations, are still limited, which narrows their scope and diminishes their complexity. To address this gap, we introduce MTPChat, a multimodal, time-aware persona dialogue dataset that integrates linguistic, visual, and temporal elements within dialogue and persona memory. Leveraging MTPChat, we propose two time-sensitive tasks: Temporal Next Response Prediction (TNRP) and Temporal Grounding Memory Prediction (TGMP), both designed to assess a model's ability to understand implicit temporal cues and dynamic interactions. Additionally, we present an innovative framework featuring an adaptive temporal module to effectively integrate multimodal streams and capture temporal dependencies. Experimental results validate the challenges posed by MTPChat and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in multimodal time-sensitive scenarios.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Approximate Bayesian inference for joint partially linear modeling of longitudinal measurements and spatial time-to-event data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05880v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of longitudinal measurements and survival time in statistical modeling offers a powerful framework for capturing the interplay between these two essential outcomes, particularly when they exhibit associations. However, in scenarios where spatial dependencies among entities are present due to geographic regions, traditional approaches may fall short. In response, this paper introduces a novel approximate Bayesian hierarchical model tailored for jointly analyzing longitudinal and spatial survival outcomes. The model leverages a conditional autoregressive structure to incorporate spatial effects, while simultaneously employing a joint partially linear model to capture the nonlinear influence of time on longitudinal responses. Through extensive simulation studies, the efficacy of the proposed method is rigorously evaluated. Furthermore, its practical utility is demonstrated through an application to real-world HIV/AIDS data sourced from various Brazilian states, showcasing its adaptability and relevance in epidemiological research.</p></details> | 23 |
| **[One-Way Functions and Polynomial Time Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02392v3)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper demonstrates a duality between the non-robustness of polynomial time dimension and the existence of one-way functions. Polynomial-time dimension (denoted $\mathrm{cdim}_\mathrm{P}$) quantifies the density of information of infinite sequences using polynomial time betting algorithms called $s$-gales. An alternate quantification of the notion of polynomial time density of information is using polynomial-time Kolmogorov complexity rate (denoted $\mathcal{K}_\text{poly}$). Hitchcock and Vinodchandran (CCC 2004) showed that $\mathrm{cdim}_\mathrm{P}$ is always greater than or equal to $\mathcal{K}_\text{poly}$. We first show that if one-way functions exist then there exists a polynomial-time samplable distribution with respect to which $\mathrm{cdim}_\mathrm{P}$ and $\mathcal{K}_\text{poly}$ are separated by a uniform gap with probability $1$. Conversely, we show that if there exists such a polynomial-time samplable distribution, then (infinitely-often) one-way functions exist. Using our main results, we solve a long standing open problem posed by Hitchcock and Vinodchandran (CCC 2004) and Stull under the assumption that one-way functions exist. We demonstrate that if one-way functions exist, then there are individual sequences $X$ whose poly-time dimension strictly exceeds $\mathcal{K}_\text{poly}(X)$, that is $\mathrm{cdim}_\mathrm{P}(X) > \mathcal{K}_\text{poly}(X)$. Further, we show that the gap between these quantities can be made as large as possible (i.e. close to 1). We also establish similar bounds for strong poly-time dimension versus asymptotic upper Kolmogorov complexity rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOS: Model Synergy for Test-Time Adaptation on LiDAR-Based 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14878v3)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D object detection is crucial for various applications but often experiences performance degradation in real-world deployments due to domain shifts. While most studies focus on cross-dataset shifts, such as changes in environments and object geometries, practical corruptions from sensor variations and weather conditions remain underexplored. In this work, we propose a novel online test-time adaptation framework for 3D detectors that effectively tackles these shifts, including a challenging cross-corruption scenario where cross-dataset shifts and corruptions co-occur. By leveraging long-term knowledge from previous test batches, our approach mitigates catastrophic forgetting and adapts effectively to diverse shifts. Specifically, we propose a Model Synergy (MOS) strategy that dynamically selects historical checkpoints with diverse knowledge and assembles them to best accommodate the current test batch. This assembly is directed by our proposed Synergy Weights (SW), which perform a weighted averaging of the selected checkpoints, minimizing redundancy in the composite model. The SWs are computed by evaluating the similarity of predicted bounding boxes on the test data and the independence of features between checkpoint pairs in the model bank. To maintain an efficient and informative model bank, we discard checkpoints with the lowest average SW scores, replacing them with newly updated models. Our method was rigorously tested against existing test-time adaptation strategies across three datasets and eight types of corruptions, demonstrating superior adaptability to dynamic scenes and conditions. Notably, it achieved a 67.3% improvement in a challenging cross-corruption scenario, offering a more comprehensive benchmark for adaptation.

We present WatchGuardian, a smartwatch-based JITI system that empowers users to define custom interventions for these personal actions with a small number of samples. For the model to detect new actions based on limited new data samples, we developed a few-shot learning pipeline that finetuned a pre-trained inertial measurement unit (IMU) model on public hand-gesture datasets. We then designed a data augmentation and synthesis process to train additional classification layers for customization. Our offline evaluation with 26 participants showed that with three, five, and ten examples, our approach achieved an average accuracy of 76.8%, 84.7%, and 87.7%, and an F1 score of 74.8%, 84.2%, and 87.2% We then conducted a four-hour intervention study to compare WatchGuardian against a rule-based intervention. Our results demonstrated that our system led to a significant reduction by 64.0 +- 22.6% in undesirable actions, substantially outperforming the baseline by 29.0%. Our findings underscore the effectiveness of a customizable, AI-driven JITI system for individuals in need of behavioral intervention in personal undesirable actions. We envision that our work can inspire broader applications of user-defined personalized intervention with advanced AI solutions.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[Optimal starting point for time series forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16843v2)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances on time series forecasting mainly focus on improving the forecasting models themselves. However, when the time series data suffer from potential structural breaks or concept drifts, the forecasting performance might be significantly reduced. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach called Optimal Starting Point Time Series Forecast (OSP-TSP) for optimal forecasting, which can be combined with existing time series forecasting models. By adjusting the sequence length via leveraging the XGBoost and LightGBM models, the proposed approach can determine the optimal starting point (OSP) of the time series and then enhance the prediction performances of the base forecasting models. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, comprehensive empirical analysis have been conducted on the M4 dataset and other real world datasets. Empirical results indicate that predictions based on the OSP-TSP approach consistently outperform those using the complete time series dataset. Moreover, comparison results reveals that combining our approach with existing forecasting models can achieve better prediction accuracy, which also reflect the advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

This is especially vital for life-threatening conditions such as Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), a chronic, progressive lung disease with a prognosis comparable to many cancers. Computed tomography (CT) imaging has been established as a reliable diagnostic tool for IPF. Accurately predicting future CT scans of early-stage IPF patients can aid in developing better treatment strategies, thereby improving survival outcomes. In this paper, we propose 4D Vector Quantised Generative Adversarial Networks (4D-VQ-GAN), a model capable of generating realistic CT volumes of IPF patients at any time point. The model is trained using a two-stage approach. In the first stage, a 3D-VQ-GAN is trained to reconstruct CT volumes. In the second stage, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) based temporal model is trained to capture the temporal dynamics of the quantised embeddings generated by the encoder in the first stage. We evaluate different configurations of our model for generating longitudinal CT scans and compare the results against ground truth data, both quantitatively and qualitatively. For validation, we conduct survival analysis using imaging biomarkers derived from generated CT scans and achieve a C-index comparable to that of biomarkers derived from the real CT scans. The survival analysis results demonstrate the potential clinical utility inherent to generated longitudinal CT scans, showing that they can reliably predict survival outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>4D im...</summary><p>4D image synthesis, VQ-GAN, neural ODEs, spatial temporal disease progression modelling, CT, IPF</p></details> |

We propose a novel conformal prediction method to address these two key challenges by integrating Transformer and Normalizing Flow. Specifically, the Transformer encodes the historical context of time series, and normalizing flow learns the transformation from the base distribution to the distribution of non-conformity scores conditioned on the encoded historical context. This enables the construction of prediction regions by transforming samples from the base distribution using the learned conditional flow. We ensure the marginal coverage by defining the prediction regions as sets in the transformed space that correspond to a predefined probability mass in the base distribution. The model is trained end-to-end by Flow Matching, avoiding the need for computationally intensive numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations. We demonstrate that our proposed method achieves smaller prediction regions compared to the baselines while satisfying the desired coverage through comprehensive experiments using simulated and real-world time series datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[TOKON: TOKenization-Optimized Normalization for time series analysis with a large language model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05701v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have rapidly evolved towards general artificial intelligence, their versatility in analyzing time series data remains limited. To address this limitation, we propose a novel normalization technique that considers the inherent nature of tokenization. The proposed Tokenization-Optimized Normalization (TOKON) simplifies time series data by representing each element with a single token, effectively reducing the number of tokens by 2 to 3 times. Additionally, we introduce a novel prompt for time series forecasting, termed Time Series Forecasting with Care (TFSC), to further enhance forecasting performance. Experimental results demonstrate that TOKON improves root mean square error (RMSE) for multi-step forecasting by approximately 7% to 18%, depending on the dataset and prompting method. Furthermore, TFSC, when used in conjunction with TOKON, shows additional improvements in forecasting accuracy for certain datasets</p></details> |  |
| **[Context information can be more important than reasoning for time series forecasting with a large language model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05699v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the evolution of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging LLMs for time series tasks. In this paper, we explore the characteristics of LLMs for time series forecasting by considering various existing and proposed prompting techniques. Forecasting for both short and long time series was evaluated. Our findings indicate that no single prompting method is universally applicable. It was also observed that simply providing proper context information related to the time series, without additional reasoning prompts, can achieve performance comparable to the best-performing prompt for each case. From this observation, it is expected that providing proper context information can be more crucial than a prompt for specific reasoning in time series forecasting. Several weaknesses in prompting for time series forecasting were also identified. First, LLMs often fail to follow the procedures described by the prompt. Second, when reasoning steps involve simple algebraic calculations with several operands, LLMs often fail to calculate accurately. Third, LLMs sometimes misunderstand the semantics of prompts, resulting in incomplete responses.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN): A Unified Time-Frequency Approach for ECG Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00497v2)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has transformed the classification of biomedical signals such as electrocardiograms (ECGs). Advances in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), enable automatic feature extraction, raising the question: Can combining time- and frequency-domain attributes enhance classification accuracy? To explore this, we evaluated three ECG classification tasks: (1) arrhythmia classification, (2) identity recognition, and (3) apnea detection. We initially tested three methods: (i) 2-D spectrogram-based frequency-time classification (SPECT), (ii) time-domain classification using a 1-D CNN (CNN1D), and (iii) frequency-domain classification using a Fourier transform-based CNN (FFT1D). Performance was validated using K-fold cross-validation. Among these, CNN1D (time only) performed best, followed by SPECT (time-frequency) and FFT1D (frequency only). Surprisingly, SPECT, which integrates time- and frequency-domain features, performed worse than CNN1D, suggesting a need for a more effective time and frequency fusion approach. To address this, we tested the recently proposed Fourier Analysis Network (FAN), which combines time- and frequency-domain features. However, FAN performed comparably to CNN1D, excelling in some tasks while underperforming in others. To enhance this approach, we developed the Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN), which integrates FAN with CNN. CFAN outperformed all previous methods across all classification tasks. These findings underscore the advantages of combining time- and frequency-domain features, demonstrating CFAN's potential as a powerful and versatile solution for ECG classification and broader biomedical signal analysis</p></details> |  |

For concurrent programs, Higher Dimensional Automata (HDA) are a very expressive model of non-interleaving concurrency. HDA recognize languages of partially ordered multisets, or pomsets. Recent work has shown that Monadic Second Order (MSO) logic is as expressive as HDA for pomset languages. In this paper, we investigate the class of pomset languages that are definable in First Order (FO) logic. As expected, this is a strict subclass of MSO-definable languages. In the case of words, Kamp's theorem states that FO is as expressive as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Our aim is to prove a variant of Kamp's theorem for pomset languages. Thus, we define a temporal logic called Sparse Pomset Temporal Logic (SPTL), and show that it is equivalent to FO, when there is no autoconcurrency.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + references + appendix, submitted to ICALP 2025.

In such graphs, an edge exists if and only if the occurrences of the corresponding vertices alternate in the word $w$. We generalise this notion to temporal graphs, constructing timesteps by partitioning the word into factors (contiguous subwords) such that no factor contains more than one copy of any given symbol. With this definition, we study the problem of \emph{exploration}, asking for the fastest schedule such that a given agent may explore all $n$ vertices of the graph. We show that if the corresponding temporal graph is connected in every timestep, we may explore the graph in $2\delta n$ timesteps, where $\delta$ is the lowest degree of any vertex in the graph. In general, we show that, for any temporal graph represented by a word of length at least $n(2dn + d)$, with a connected underlying graph, the full graph can be explored in $2 d n$ timesteps, where $d$ is the diameter of the graph. We show this is asymptotically optimal by providing a class of graphs of diameter $d$ requiring $\Omega(d n)$ timesteps to explore, for any $d \in [1, n]$.</p></details> | Preprint |

Although video super-resolution (VSR) is an efficient technique to enhance video resolution, relatively VSR methods focus on compressed videos. Directly applying general VSR approaches leads to the failure of improving practical videos, especially when frames are highly compressed at a low bit rate. Recently, diffusion models have achieved superior performance in low-level visual tasks, and their high-realism generation capability enables them to be applied in VSR. To synthesize more compression-lost details and refine temporal consistency, we propose a novel Spatial Degradation-Aware and Temporal Consistent (SDATC) diffusion model for compressed VSR. Specifically, we introduce a distortion Control module (DCM) to modulate diffusion model inputs and guide the generation. Next, the diffusion model executes the denoising process for texture generation with fine-tuned spatial prompt-based compression-aware module (PCAM) and spatio-temporal attention module (STAM). PCAM extracts features to encode specific compression information dynamically. STAM extends the spatial attention mechanism to a spatio-temporal dimension for capturing temporal correlation. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in enhancing compressed videos.</p></details> |  |

Conversely, while Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown remarkable capabilities in processing textual data, they lack mechanisms for handling temporal dynamics. To bridge this gap, we introduce Language-TPP, a unified framework that integrates TPPs with LLMs for enhanced event sequence modeling. Language-TPP introduces a novel temporal encoding mechanism that converts continuous time intervals into specialized byte-tokens, enabling seamless integration with standard LLM architectures. This approach allows Language-TPP to achieve state-of-the-art performance across multiple TPP tasks, including event time prediction, type prediction, and intensity estimation, on five datasets. Additionally, we demonstrate that incorporating temporal information significantly improves the quality of generated event descriptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets for Time-series Joint Alignment and Averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06591v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In time-series analysis, nonlinear temporal misalignment remains a pivotal challenge that forestalls even simple averaging. Since its introduction, the Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Net (DTAN), which we first introduced (Weber et al., 2019) and further developed in (Weber & Freifeld, 2023), has proven itself as an effective solution for this problem (these conference papers are earlier partial versions of the current manuscript). DTAN predicts and applies diffeomorphic transformations in an input-dependent manner, thus facilitating the joint alignment (JA) and averaging of time-series ensembles in an unsupervised or a weakly-supervised manner. The inherent challenges of the weakly/unsupervised setting, particularly the risk of trivial solutions through excessive signal distortion, are mitigated using either one of two distinct strategies: 1) a regularization term for warps; 2) using the Inverse Consistency Averaging Error (ICAE). The latter is a novel, regularization-free approach which also facilitates the JA of variable-length signals. We also further extend our framework to incorporate multi-task learning (MT-DTAN), enabling simultaneous time-series alignment and classification. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different backbone architectures, demonstrating their efficacy in time-series alignment tasks. Finally, we showcase the utility of our approach in enabling Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for misaligned time-series data. Extensive experiments across 128 UCR datasets validate the superiority of our approach over contemporary averaging methods, including both traditional and learning-based approaches, marking a significant advancement in the field of time-series analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript covers and extends the papers: Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets (DTAN; NeruIPS 2019) and Regularization-free Diffeomorphic Temporal Alignment Nets (ICML 2023).

We present an unsupervised approach to extract descriptive features from 3D+t point clouds of zebrafish embryos and subsequently use those features to temporally align corresponding developmental stages. An autoencoder architecture is proposed to learn a descriptive representation of the point clouds and we designed a deep regression network for their temporal alignment. We achieve a high alignment accuracy with an average mismatch of only 3.83 minutes over an experimental duration of 5.3 hours. As a fully-unsupervised approach, there is no manual labeling effort required and unlike manual analyses the method easily scales. Besides, the alignment without human annotation of the data also avoids any influence caused by subjective bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint clustering with alignment for temporal data in a one-point-per-experiment setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10282v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal data, obtained in the setting where it is only possible to observe one time point per experiment, is widely used in different research fields, yet remains insufficiently addressed from the statistical point of view. Such data often contain observations of a large number of entities, in which case it is of interest to identify a small number of representative behavior types. In this paper, we propose a new method that simultaneously performs clustering and alignment of temporal objects inferred from these data, providing insight into the relationships between entities. Simulations confirm the ability of the proposed approach to leverage multiple properties of the complex data we target such as accessible uncertainties, correlations and a small number of time points. We illustrate it on real data encoding cellular response to a radiation treatment with high energy, supported with the results of an enrichment analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Score-Based Causal Discovery with Temporal Background Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06232v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal background information can improve causal discovery algorithms by orienting edges and identifying relevant adjustment sets. We develop the Temporal Greedy Equivalence Search (TGES) algorithm and terminology essential for score-based causal discovery with tiered background knowledge. TGES learns a restricted Markov equivalence class of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) using observational data and tiered background knowledge. To construct TGES we formulate a scoring criterion that accounts for tiered background knowledge. We establish theoretical results for TGES, stating that the algorithm always returns a tiered maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (tiered MPDAG) and that this tiered MPDAG contains the true DAG in the large sample limit. We present a simulation study indicating a gain from using tiered background knowledge and an improved precision-recall trade-off compared to the temporal PC algorithm. We provide a real-world example on life-course health data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Temporal Tensor Decomposition with Rank-revealing Latent-ODE](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06164v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor decomposition is a fundamental tool for analyzing multi-dimensional data by learning low-rank factors to represent high-order interactions. While recent works on temporal tensor decomposition have made significant progress by incorporating continuous timestamps in latent factors, they still struggle with general tensor data with continuous indexes not only in the temporal mode but also in other modes, such as spatial coordinates in climate data. Additionally, the problem of determining the tensor rank remains largely unexplored in temporal tensor models. To address these limitations, we propose \underline{G}eneralized temporal tensor decomposition with \underline{R}ank-r\underline{E}vealing laten\underline{T}-ODE (GRET). Our approach encodes continuous spatial indexes as learnable Fourier features and employs neural ODEs in latent space to learn the temporal trajectories of factors. To automatically reveal the rank of temporal tensors, we introduce a rank-revealing Gaussian-Gamma prior over the factor trajectories. We develop an efficient variational inference scheme with an analytical evidence lower bound, enabling sampling-free optimization. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that GRET not only reveals the underlying ranks of temporal tensors but also significantly outperforms existing methods in prediction performance and robustness against noise.</p></details> |  |

It posits three embedded processing layers that unfold concurrently in the human mind: sequences of routinized/automated processes are observable in fluent translation production, cognitive/reflective thoughts lead to longer keystroke pauses, while affective/emotional states of the mind may be identified through characteristic patterns of typing and gazing. Utilizing data from the CRITT Translation Process Research Database (TPR-DB), the article illustrates how the temporal structure of keystroke and gaze data elicits the three assumed hidden mental processing strata. The article relates this embedded generative model to various theoretical frameworks, dual-process theories and Robinson's (2023) ideosomatic theory of translation, opening exciting new theoretical horizons for Cognitive Translation Studies, grounded in empirical data and evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Working Memory: Query-Guided Segment Refinement for Enhanced Multimodal Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06020v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal foundation models (MFMs) have demonstrated significant success in tasks such as visual captioning, question answering, and image-text retrieval. However, these models face inherent limitations due to their finite internal capacity, which restricts their ability to process extended temporal sequences, a crucial requirement for comprehensive video and audio analysis. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a specialized cognitive module, temporal working memory (TWM), which aims to enhance the temporal modeling capabilities of MFMs. It selectively retains task-relevant information across temporal dimensions, ensuring that critical details are preserved throughout the processing of video and audio content. The TWM uses a query-guided attention approach to focus on the most informative multimodal segments within temporal sequences. By retaining only the most relevant content, TWM optimizes the use of the model's limited capacity, enhancing its temporal modeling ability. This plug-and-play module can be easily integrated into existing MFMs. With our TWM, nine state-of-the-art models exhibit significant performance improvements across tasks such as video captioning, question answering, and video-text retrieval. By enhancing temporal modeling, TWM extends the capability of MFMs to handle complex, time-sensitive data effectively.

Using cognitive science methodologies, we analyze attention scores and outputs of the GPT-2 models of varying sizes. Across attention heads, we observe effects characteristic of human episodic memory, including temporal contiguity, primacy and recency. Transformer outputs demonstrate a tendency toward in-context serial recall. Importantly, this effect is eliminated after the ablation of the induction heads, which are the driving force behind the contiguity effect. Our findings offer insights into how transformers organize information temporally during in-context learning, shedding light on their similarities and differences with human memory and learning.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has adapted popular notions of justified representation as well as voting rules that provide strong representation guarantees from the multiwinner election setting to this model. In our work, we focus on the complexity of verifying whether a given outcome offers proportional representation. We show that in the temporal setting verification is strictly harder than in multiwinner voting, but identify natural special cases that enable efficient algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appears in the 39th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2025</p></details> |

Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate on the level of models (traces, automata) not programs, creating a verification gap and losing the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics (i.e: Hoare Logic). Reasoning about infinite traces and automata can be fairly low-level, requiring complex (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., guardedness checker). We propose a modular approach to the verification of general temporal properties with a new temporal logic that we call Ticl. Using Ticl, we internalize complex (co-)inductive proof techniques to structural lemmas and reasoning about variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform modular proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working in a high-level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, shared memory and distributed consensus, exhibiting a low program-to-proof ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lossless Acceleration of Large Language Models with Hierarchical Drafting based on Temporal Locality in Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05609v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating inference in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for real-time interactions, as they have been widely incorporated into real-world services. Speculative decoding, a fully algorithmic solution, has gained attention for improving inference speed by drafting and verifying tokens, thereby generating multiple tokens in a single forward pass. However, current drafting strategies usually require significant fine-tuning or have inconsistent performance across tasks. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchy Drafting (HD), a novel lossless drafting approach that organizes various token sources into multiple databases in a hierarchical framework based on temporal locality. In the drafting step, HD sequentially accesses multiple databases to obtain draft tokens from the highest to the lowest locality, ensuring consistent acceleration across diverse tasks and minimizing drafting latency. Our experiments on Spec-Bench using LLMs with 7B and 13B parameters demonstrate that HD outperforms existing database drafting methods, achieving robust inference speedups across model sizes, tasks, and temperatures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of NAACL 2025</p></details> |

While this is conceptually simple and appealing, it is not clear how to automatically learn representations that enable this sort of compositionality. We show that learning to associate the representations of current and future states with a temporal alignment loss can improve compositional generalization, even in the absence of any explicit subtask planning or reinforcement learning. We evaluate our approach across diverse robotic manipulation tasks as well as in simulation, showing substantial improvements for tasks specified with either language or goal images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imitation Learning from a Single Temporally Misaligned Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05397v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine the problem of learning sequential tasks from a single visual demonstration. A key challenge arises when demonstrations are temporally misaligned due to variations in timing, differences in embodiment, or inconsistencies in execution. Existing approaches treat imitation as a distribution-matching problem, aligning individual frames between the agent and the demonstration. However, we show that such frame-level matching fails to enforce temporal ordering or ensure consistent progress. Our key insight is that matching should instead be defined at the level of sequences. We propose that perfect matching occurs when one sequence successfully covers all the subgoals in the same order as the other sequence. We present ORCA (ORdered Coverage Alignment), a dense per-timestep reward function that measures the probability of the agent covering demonstration frames in the correct order. On temporally misaligned demonstrations, we show that agents trained with the ORCA reward achieve $4.5$x improvement ($0.11 \rightarrow 0.50$ average normalized returns) for Meta-world tasks and $6.6$x improvement ($6.55 \rightarrow 43.3$ average returns) for Humanoid-v4 tasks compared to the best frame-level matching algorithms. We also provide empirical analysis showing that ORCA is robust to varying levels of temporal misalignment. Our code is available at https://github.com/portal-cornell/orca/</p></details> |  |

The competition aimed to recognize human actions using a diverse dataset of 20 action classes, collected from multi-modal sources. The proposed approach is built upon the \acl{TSM}, a technique aimed at efficiently capturing temporal dynamics in video data, incorporating multiple data input types. Our strategy included transfer learning to leverage pre-trained models, followed by meticulous fine-tuning on the challenge's specific dataset to optimize performance for the 20 action classes. We carefully selected a backbone network to balance computational efficiency and recognition accuracy and further refined the model using an ensemble technique that integrates outputs from different modalities. This ensemble approach proved crucial in boosting the overall performance. Our solution achieved a perfect top-1 accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in recognizing human actions across 20 classes.

| **[Fast Subspace Fluid Simulation with Temporal-Aware Basis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05339v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel reduced-order fluid simulation technique leveraging Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) to achieve fast, memory-efficient, and user-controllable subspace simulation. We demonstrate that our approach combines the strengths of both spatial reduced order models (ROMs) as well as spectral decompositions. By optimizing for the operator that evolves a system state from one timestep to the next, rather than the system state itself, we gain both the compressive power of spatial ROMs as well as the intuitive physical dynamics of spectral methods. The latter property is of particular interest in graphics applications, where user control of fluid phenomena is of high demand. We demonstrate this in various applications including spatial and temporal modulation tools and fluid upscaling with added turbulence. We adapt DMD for graphics applications by reducing computational overhead, incorporating user-defined force inputs, and optimizing memory usage with randomized SVD. The integration of OptDMD and DMD with Control (DMDc) facilitates noise-robust reconstruction and real-time user interaction. We demonstrate the technique's robustness across diverse simulation scenarios, including artistic editing, time-reversal, and super-resolution. Through experimental validation on challenging scenarios, such as colliding vortex rings and boundary-interacting plumes, our method also exhibits superior performance and fidelity with significantly fewer basis functions compared to existing spatial ROMs. The inherent linearity of the DMD operator enables unique application modes, such as time-reversible fluid simulation. This work establishes another avenue for developing real-time, high-quality fluid simulations, enriching the space of fluid simulation techniques in interactive graphics and animation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Counting Fish with Temporal Representations of Sonar Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05129v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimates of salmon escapement - the number of fish migrating upstream to spawn - are key data for conservation and fishery management. Existing methods for salmon counting using high-resolution imaging sonar hardware are non-invasive and compatible with computer vision processing. Prior work in this area has utilized object detection and tracking based methods for automated salmon counting. However, these techniques remain inaccessible to many sonar deployment sites due to limited compute and connectivity in the field. We propose an alternative lightweight computer vision method for fish counting based on analyzing echograms - temporal representations that compress several hundred frames of imaging sonar video into a single image. We predict upstream and downstream counts within 200-frame time windows directly from echograms using a ResNet-18 model, and propose a set of domain-specific image augmentations and a weakly-supervised training protocol to further improve results. We achieve a count error of 23% on representative data from the Kenai River in Alaska, demonstrating the feasibility of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024. 6 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Learning Temporal Invariance in Android Malware Detectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05098v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning-based Android malware detectors degrade over time due to natural distribution drift caused by malware variants and new families. This paper systematically investigates the challenges classifiers trained with empirical risk minimization (ERM) face against such distribution shifts and attributes their shortcomings to their inability to learn stable discriminative features. Invariant learning theory offers a promising solution by encouraging models to generate stable representations crossing environments that expose the instability of the training set. However, the lack of prior environment labels, the diversity of drift factors, and low-quality representations caused by diverse families make this task challenging. To address these issues, we propose TIF, the first temporal invariant training framework for malware detection, which aims to enhance the ability of detectors to learn stable representations across time. TIF organizes environments based on application observation dates to reveal temporal drift, integrating specialized multi-proxy contrastive learning and invariant gradient alignment to generate and align environments with high-quality, stable representations. TIF can be seamlessly integrated into any learning-based detector. Experiments on a decade-long dataset show that TIF excels, particularly in early deployment stages, addressing real-world needs and outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The controller is used as the current action-value function of a deep Expected Sarsa where the subsequent action-value function, usually obtained with a secondary NMPC, is approximated with a neural network (NN). With respect to existing methods, we add to the NN's input the current value of the NMPC's learned parameters so that the network is able to approximate the action-value function and stabilize the learning performance. Additionally, with the use of the NN, the real-time computational burden is approximately halved without affecting the closed-loop performance. Furthermore, we combine gradient temporal difference methods with parametrized NMPC as function approximator of the Expected Sarsa RL method to overcome the potential parameters divergence and instability issues when nonlinearities are present in the function approximation. The simulation result shows that the proposed approach converges to a locally optimal solution without instability problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Power of Heuristics in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04910v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic graph datasets often exhibit strong temporal patterns, such as recency, which prioritizes recent interactions, and popularity, which favors frequently occurring nodes. We demonstrate that simple heuristics leveraging only these patterns can perform on par or outperform state-of-the-art neural network models under standard evaluation protocols. To further explore these dynamics, we introduce metrics that quantify the impact of recency and popularity across datasets. Our experiments on BenchTemp and the Temporal Graph Benchmark show that our approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance across all datasets in the latter and secure top ranks on multiple datasets in the former. These results emphasize the importance of refined evaluation schemes to enable fair comparisons and promote the development of more robust temporal graph models. Additionally, they reveal that current deep learning methods often struggle to capture the key patterns underlying predictions in real-world temporal graphs. For reproducibility, we have made our code publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[$TAR^2$: Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution for Optimal Policy Preservation in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04864v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), learning effective policies is challenging when global rewards are sparse and delayed. This difficulty arises from the need to assign credit across both agents and time steps, a problem that existing methods often fail to address in episodic, long-horizon tasks. We propose Temporal-Agent Reward Redistribution $TAR^2$, a novel approach that decomposes sparse global rewards into agent-specific, time-step-specific components, thereby providing more frequent and accurate feedback for policy learning. Theoretically, we show that $TAR^2$ (i) aligns with potential-based reward shaping, preserving the same optimal policies as the original environment, and (ii) maintains policy gradient update directions identical to those under the original sparse reward, ensuring unbiased credit signals. Empirical results on two challenging benchmarks, SMACLite and Google Research Football, demonstrate that $TAR^2$ significantly stabilizes and accelerates convergence, outperforming strong baselines like AREL and STAS in both learning speed and final performance. These findings establish $TAR^2$ as a principled and practical solution for agent-temporal credit assignment in sparse-reward multi-agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Recent advancements in machine learning technologies have showcased their efficacy in discerning authentic profit signals within the realm of stock trend forecasting, predominantly employing temporal data derived from historical stock price patterns. Nevertheless, the inherently volatile and dynamic characteristics of the stock market render the learning and capture of multi-scale temporal dependencies and stable trading opportunities a formidable challenge. This predicament is primarily attributed to the difficulty in distinguishing real profit signal patterns amidst a plethora of mixed, noisy data. In response to these complexities, we propose a Multi-Scale Temporal Memory Learning and Efficient Debiasing (MTMD) model. This innovative approach encompasses the creation of a learnable embedding coupled with external attention, serving as a memory module through self-similarity. It aims to mitigate noise interference and bolster temporal consistency within the model. The MTMD model adeptly amalgamates comprehensive local data at each timestamp while concurrently focusing on salient historical patterns on a global scale. Furthermore, the incorporation of a graph network, tailored to assimilate global and local information, facilitates the adaptive fusion of heterogeneous multi-scale data. Rigorous ablation studies and experimental evaluations affirm that the MTMD model surpasses contemporary state-of-the-art methodologies by a substantial margin in benchmark datasets.

With a robust and accurate tracking system on surgical videos, the motion dynamics and movement patterns of the hands can be captured and analyzed for many rich tasks. In this work, we propose a novel hand pose estimation model, CondPose, which improves detection and tracking accuracy by incorporating a pose prior into its prediction. We show improvements over state-of-the-art methods which provide frame-wise independent predictions, by following a temporally guided approach that effectively leverages past predictions. We collect Surgical Hands, the first dataset that provides multi-instance articulated hand pose annotations for videos. Our dataset provides over 8.1k annotated hand poses from publicly available surgical videos and bounding boxes, pose annotations, and tracking IDs to enable multi-instance tracking. When evaluated on Surgical Hands, we show our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approach using mean Average Precision (mAP), to measure pose estimation accuracy, and Multiple Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA), to assess pose tracking performance. In comparison to a frame-wise independent strategy, we show greater performance in detecting and tracking hand poses and more substantial impact on localization accuracy. This has positive implications in generating more accurate representations of hands in the scene to be used for targeted downstream tasks.</p></details> | Accepted to IJCARS |

To assess their efficacy, models are evaluated on benchmark datasets involving continuous-time and discrete-time temporal graphs. However, as we show in this work, the suitability of common batch-oriented evaluation depends on the datasets' characteristics, which can cause multiple issues: For continuous-time temporal graphs, fixed-size batches create time windows with different durations, resulting in an inconsistent dynamic link prediction task. For discrete-time temporal graphs, the sequence of batches can additionally introduce temporal dependencies that are not present in the data. In this work, we empirically show that this common evaluation approach leads to skewed model performance and hinders the fair comparison of methods. We mitigate this problem by reformulating dynamic link prediction as a link forecasting task that better accounts for temporal information present in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 13 figures, revised main text including additional experiments</p></details> |

However, integrating the VCS AI task with the conventional order serving task is challenging, due to their inconsistent spatio-temporal characteristics: (i) The distributions of ride orders and data point-of-interests (PoIs) may not coincide in geography, both following a priori unknown patterns; (ii) they have distinct forms of temporal effects, i.e., prolonged waiting makes orders become instantly invalid while data with increased staleness gradually reduces its utility for model fine-tuning.To overcome these obstacles, we propose an online framework based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) with careful augmentation. A new quality-of-service (QoS) metric is designed to characterize and balance the utility of the two joint tasks, under the effects of varying data volumes and staleness. We also integrate graph neural networks (GNNs) with MARL to enhance state representations, capturing graph-structured, time-varying dependencies among vehicles and across locations. Extensive experiments on our testbed simulator, utilizing various real-world foundation model fine-tuning tasks and the New York City Taxi ride order dataset, demonstrate the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network: Bidirectional Depth Deep Learning Architecture for Spatial-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08411v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of spatial-temporal (ST) information in dynamic systems, such as urban mobility and weather patterns, is a crucial yet challenging problem. The complexity stems from the intricate interplay between spatial proximity and temporal relevance, where both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations are present in convoluted patterns. Existing approaches, including traditional statistical methods and conventional neural networks, may provide inaccurate results due to the lack of an effective mechanism that simultaneously incorporates information at variable temporal depths while maintaining spatial context, resulting in a trade-off between comprehensive long-term historical analysis and responsiveness to short-term new information. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes the BiDepth Multimodal Neural Network (BDMNN) with bidirectional depth modulation that enables a comprehensive understanding of both long-term seasonality and short-term fluctuations, adapting to the complex ST context. Case studies with real-world public data demonstrate significant improvements in prediction accuracy, with a 12% reduction in Mean Squared Error for urban traffic prediction and a 15% improvement in rain precipitation forecasting compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, without demanding extra computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to Applied Intelligence for review</p></details> |

This progress enables applications such as match outcome prediction, player scouting, and tactical analysis. In soccer, the effective utilization of event and tracking data is fundamental for capturing and analyzing the dynamics of the game. However, there are two primary challenges: the limited availability of event data, primarily restricted to top-tier teams and leagues, and the scarcity and high cost of tracking data, which complicates its integration with event data for comprehensive analysis. Here we propose OpenSTARLab, an open-source framework designed to democratize spatio-temporal agent data analysis in sports by addressing these key challenges. OpenSTARLab includes the Pre-processing Package that standardizes event and tracking data through Unified and Integrated Event Data and State-Action-Reward formats, the Event Modeling Package that implements deep learning-based event prediction, alongside the RLearn Package for reinforcement learning tasks. These technical components facilitate the handling of diverse data sources and support advanced analytical tasks, thereby enhancing the overall functionality and usability of the framework. To assess OpenSTARLab's effectiveness, we conducted several experimental evaluations. These demonstrate the superior performance of the specific event prediction model in terms of action and time prediction accuracies and maintained its robust event simulation performance. Furthermore, reinforcement learning experiments reveal a trade-off between action accuracy and temporal difference loss and show comprehensive visualization. Overall, OpenSTARLab serves as a robust platform for researchers and practitioners, enhancing innovation and collaboration in the field of soccer data analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>OpenS...</summary><p>OpenSTARLab is available at https://github.com/open-starlab, and its documentation can be found at https://openstarlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/</p></details> |

This paper proposes MD-BERT, a novel multi-stream approach that integrates complementary pre-processing techniques such as gamma correction and histogram equalization alongside raw dark frames to address these challenges. We introduce the Dynamic Feature Fusion (DFF) module, extending existing attentional fusion methods to a three-stream setting, thereby capturing fine-grained and global contextual information across different brightness and contrast enhancements. The fused spatiotemporal features are then processed by a BERT-based temporal model, which leverages its bidirectional self-attention to effectively capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships across frames. Extensive experiments on the ARID V1.0 and ARID V1.5 dark video datasets show that MD-BERT outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies further highlight the individual contributions of each input stream and the effectiveness of the proposed DFF and BERT modules.

A crucial yet underexplored aspect in the development of these systems is the creation of computer vision models capable of autonomously segmenting full-procedure colonoscopy videos into anatomical sections and procedural phases. In this work, we aim to create the first open-access dataset for this task and propose a state-of-the-art approach, benchmarked against competitive models. We annotated the publicly available REAL-Colon dataset, consisting of 2.7 million frames from 60 complete colonoscopy videos, with frame-level labels for anatomical locations and colonoscopy phases across nine categories. We then present ColonTCN, a learning-based architecture that employs custom temporal convolutional blocks designed to efficiently capture long temporal dependencies for the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy videos. We also propose a dual k-fold cross-validation evaluation protocol for this benchmark, which includes model assessment on unseen, multi-center data.ColonTCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in classification accuracy while maintaining a low parameter count when evaluated using the two proposed k-fold cross-validation settings, outperforming competitive models. We report ablation studies to provide insights into the challenges of this task and highlight the benefits of the custom temporal convolutional blocks, which enhance learning and improve model efficiency. We believe that the proposed open-access benchmark and the ColonTCN approach represent a significant advancement in the temporal segmentation of colonoscopy procedures, fostering further open-access research to address this clinical need.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has trained deep SNN models with accuracy on par with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Although the event-driven and sparse nature of SNNs show potential for more energy efficient computation than ANNs, SNN neurons have internal states which evolve over time. Keeping track of SNN states can significantly increase data movement and storage requirements, potentially losing its advantages with respect to ANNs. This paper investigates the energy effects of having neuron states, and how it is influenced by the chosen mapping to realistic hardware architectures with advanced memory hierarchies. Therefore, we develop STEMS, a mapping design space exploration tool for SNNs. STEMS models SNN's stateful behavior and explores intra-layer and inter-layer mapping optimizations to minimize data movement, considering both spatial and temporal SNN dimensions. Using STEMS, we show up to 12x reduction in off-chip data movement and 5x reduction in energy (on top of intra-layer optimizations), on two event-based vision SNN benchmarks. Finally, neuron states may not be needed for all SNN layers. By optimizing neuron states for one of our benchmarks, we show 20x reduction in neuron states and 1.4x better performance without accuracy loss.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 23 figures, under review at IEEE TC</p></details> |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Knowledge Distillation for Takeaway Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16502v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The takeaway recommendation system aims to recommend users' future takeaway purchases based on their historical purchase behaviors, thereby improving user satisfaction and boosting merchant sales. Existing methods focus on incorporating auxiliary information or leveraging knowledge graphs to alleviate the sparsity issue of user purchase sequences. However, two main challenges limit the performance of these approaches: (1) capturing dynamic user preferences on complex geospatial information and (2) efficiently integrating spatial-temporal knowledge from both graphs and sequence data with low computational costs. In this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal knowledge distillation model for takeaway recommendation (STKDRec) based on the two-stage training process. Specifically, during the first pre-training stage, a spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG) encoder is trained to extract high-order spatial-temporal dependencies and collaborative associations from the STKG. During the second spatial-temporal knowledge distillation (STKD) stage, a spatial-temporal Transformer (ST-Transformer) is employed to comprehensively model dynamic user preferences on various types of fine-grained geospatial information from a sequential perspective. Furthermore, the STKD strategy is introduced to transfer graph-based spatial-temporal knowledge to the ST-Transformer, facilitating the adaptive fusion of rich knowledge derived from both the STKG and sequence data while reducing computational overhead. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that STKDRec significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2025 |

In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift from traditional linear models with expert-designed factors to more flexible nonlinear machine learning-based models with data-driven factors, aiming to enhance the effectiveness of these factor models. However, due to the low signal-to-noise ratio in market data, mining effective factors in data-driven models remains challenging. In this work, we propose a hypergraph-based factor model with temporal residual contrastive learning (FactorGCL) that employs a hypergraph structure to better capture high-order nonlinear relationships among stock returns and factors. To mine hidden factors that supplement human-designed prior factors for predicting stock returns, we design a cascading residual hypergraph architecture, in which the hidden factors are extracted from the residual information after removing the influence of prior factors. Additionally, we propose a temporal residual contrastive learning method to guide the extraction of effective and comprehensive hidden factors by contrasting stock-specific residual information over different time periods. Our extensive experiments on real stock market data demonstrate that FactorGCL not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods but also mines effective hidden factors for predicting stock returns.</p></details> |  |

Achieving successful VSR requires producing realistic HR details and ensuring both spatial and temporal consistency. To restore realistic details, diffusion-based VSR approaches have recently been proposed. However, the inherent randomness of diffusion, combined with their tile-based approach, often leads to spatio-temporal inconsistencies. In this paper, we propose DC-VSR, a novel VSR approach to produce spatially and temporally consistent VSR results with realistic textures. To achieve spatial and temporal consistency, DC-VSR adopts a novel Spatial Attention Propagation (SAP) scheme and a Temporal Attention Propagation (TAP) scheme that propagate information across spatio-temporal tiles based on the self-attention mechanism. To enhance high-frequency details, we also introduce Detail-Suppression Self-Attention Guidance (DSSAG), a novel diffusion guidance scheme. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that DC-VSR achieves spatially and temporally consistent, high-quality VSR results, outperforming previous approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Equal...</summary><p>Equal contributions from first two authors</p></details> |

Combining the relational and temporal aspects into a single lens offers capabilities beyond either framework, including centralities to capture important learning events, community detection to identify behavior patterns, and clustering to reveal temporal patterns. Furthermore, TNA introduces several significance tests that go beyond either method and add rigor to the analysis. Here, we introduce the theoretical and mathematical foundations of TNA and we demonstrate the functionalities of TNA with a case study where students (n=191) engaged in small-group collaboration to map patterns of group dynamics using the theories of co-regulation and socially-shared regulated learning. The analysis revealed that TNA can map the regulatory processes as well as identify important events, patterns, and clusters. Bootstrap validation established the significant transitions and eliminated spurious transitions. As such, TNA can capture learning dynamics and provide a robust framework for investigating the temporal evolution of learning processes. Future directions include -- inter alia -- expanding estimation methods, reliability assessment, and building longitudinal TNA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Learning Analytics & Knowledge (LAK '25)</p></details> |

Owing to the inherent sparsity in spike generation within SNNs, the in-depth analysis and optimization of intermediate output spikes are often neglected. This oversight significantly restricts the inherent energy efficiency of SNNs and diminishes their advantages in spatiotemporal feature extraction, resulting in a lack of accuracy and unnecessary energy expenditure. In this work, we analyze the inherent spiking characteristics of SNNs from both temporal and spatial perspectives. In terms of spatial analysis, we find that shallow layers tend to focus on learning vertical variations, while deeper layers gradually learn horizontal variations of features. Regarding temporal analysis, we observe that there is not a significant difference in feature learning across different time steps. This suggests that increasing the time steps has limited effect on feature learning. Based on the insights derived from these analyses, we propose a Frequency-based Spatial-Temporal Attention (FSTA) module to enhance feature learning in SNNs. This module aims to improve the feature learning capabilities by suppressing redundant spike features.The experimental results indicate that the introduction of the FSTA module significantly reduces the spike firing rate of SNNs, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines across multiple datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

To address this, numerous temporal graph neural networks (temporal GNNs) and benchmark datasets have been developed. However, these datasets often feature excessive repeated edges and lack complex sequential dynamics, a key characteristic inherent in many real-world applications such as recommender systems and ``Who-To-Follow'' on social networks. This oversight has led existing methods to inadvertently downplay the importance of learning sequential dynamics, focusing primarily on predicting repeated edges. In this study, we demonstrate that existing methods, such as GraphMixer and DyGFormer, are inherently incapable of learning simple sequential dynamics, such as ``a user who has followed OpenAI and Anthropic is more likely to follow AI at Meta next.'' Motivated by this issue, we introduce the Temporal Graph Benchmark with Sequential Dynamics (TGB-Seq), a new benchmark carefully curated to minimize repeated edges, challenging models to learn sequential dynamics and generalize to unseen edges. TGB-Seq comprises large real-world datasets spanning diverse domains, including e-commerce interactions, movie ratings, business reviews, social networks, citation networks and web link networks. Benchmarking experiments reveal that current methods usually suffer significant performance degradation and incur substantial training costs on TGB-Seq, posing new challenges and opportunities for future research.

This task is however challenging due to multiple sign variations, complexity in language and inherent richness of expressions. Computational approaches have evidenced capabilities to support SLT. Nonetheless, these approaches remain limited to cover gestures variability and support long sequence translations. This paper introduces a Transformer-based architecture that encodes spatio-temporal motion gestures, preserving both local and long-range spatial information through the use of multiple convolutional and attention mechanisms. The proposed approach was validated on the Colombian Sign Language Translation Dataset (CoL-SLTD) outperforming baseline approaches, and achieving a BLEU4 of 46.84%. Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on the RWTH-PHOENIX-Weather-2014T (PHOENIX14T), achieving a BLEU4 score of 30.77%, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in handling real-world variations</p></details> |  |

It is a multimodal task aimed at localizing specific subjects spatio-temporally based on textual queries without bounding box supervision. Motivated by recent advancements in multi-modal foundation models for grounding tasks, we first explore the potential of state-of-the-art object detection models for WSTVG. Despite their robust zero-shot capabilities, our adaptation reveals significant limitations, including inconsistent temporal predictions, inadequate understanding of complex queries, and challenges in adapting to difficult scenarios. We propose CoSPaL (Contextual Self-Paced Learning), a novel approach which is designed to overcome these limitations. CoSPaL integrates three core components: (1) Tubelet Phrase Grounding (TPG), which introduces spatio-temporal prediction by linking textual queries to tubelets; (2) Contextual Referral Grounding (CRG), which improves comprehension of complex queries by extracting contextual information to refine object identification over time; and (3) Self-Paced Scene Understanding (SPS), a training paradigm that progressively increases task difficulty, enabling the model to adapt to complex scenarios by transitioning from coarse to fine-grained understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR'...</summary><p>ICLR'25 Main Conference.

Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we adapt and specialise the robust and conjugate GP (RCGP) framework of Altamirano et al. (2024) to the spatio-temporal setting. In doing so, we obtain an outlier-robust spatio-temporal GP with a computational cost comparable to classical spatio-temporal GPs. We also overcome the three main drawbacks of RCGPs: their unreliable performance when the prior mean is chosen poorly, their lack of reliable uncertainty quantification, and the need to carefully select a hyperparameter by hand. We study our method extensively in finance and weather forecasting applications, demonstrating that it provides a reliable approach to spatio-temporal modelling in the presence of outliers.</p></details> |  |

We further introduce the TUMTraffic-Qwen baseline model, enhanced with visual token sampling strategies, providing valuable insights into the challenges of fine-grained spatio-temporal reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the dataset's complexity, highlight the limitations of existing models, and position TUMTraffic-VideoQA as a robust foundation for advancing research in intelligent transportation systems.

Unlike static data such as images, sequential data consists of consecutive data frames indexed by time, exhibiting rich spatial and temporal dependencies. These dependencies represent the underlying dynamic model and are critical to validate the generated data. In this paper, we make the first theoretical step towards bridging diffusion transformers for capturing spatial-temporal dependencies. Specifically, we establish score approximation and distribution estimation guarantees of diffusion transformers for learning Gaussian process data with covariance functions of various decay patterns. We highlight how the spatial-temporal dependencies are captured and affect learning efficiency. Our study proposes a novel transformer approximation theory, where the transformer acts to unroll an algorithm. We support our theoretical results by numerical experiments, providing strong evidence that spatial-temporal dependencies are captured within attention layers, aligning with our approximation theory.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Measuring social mobility in temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02365v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In complex networks, the rich-get-richer effect (nodes with high degree at one point in time gain more degree in their future) is commonly observed. In practice this is often studied on a static network snapshot, for example, a preferential attachment model assumed to explain the more highly connected nodes or a rich-club}effect that analyses the most highly connected nodes. In this paper, we consider temporal measures of how success (measured here as node degree) propagates across time. By analogy with social mobility (a measure people moving within a social hierarchy through their life) we define hierarchical mobility to measure how a node's propensity to gain degree changes over time. We introduce an associated taxonomy of temporal correlation statistics including mobility, philanthropy and community. Mobility measures the extent to which a node's degree gain in one time period predicts its degree gain in the next. Philanthropy and community measure similar properties related to node neighbourhood. We apply these statistics both to artificial models and to 26 real temporal networks. We find that most of our networks show a tendency for individual nodes and their neighbourhoods to remain in similar hierarchical positions over time, while most networks show low correlative effects between individuals and their neighbourhoods. Moreover, we show that the mobility taxonomy can discriminate between networks from different fields. We also generate artificial network models to gain intuition about the behaviour and expected range of the statistics. The artificial models show that the opposite of the "rich-get-richer" effect requires the existence of inequality of degree in a network. Overall, we show that measuring the hierarchical mobility of a temporal network is an invaluable resource for discovering its underlying structural dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 pages supplemental material.

While spiking neural networks (SNNs) allow for efficient inference by processing complex spatio-temporal dynamics in an event-driven fashion, training them on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to the high computational and memory demands of conventional error backpropagation (BP)-based approaches. In this work, we draw inspiration from biological mechanisms such as eligibility traces, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, and neural activity synchronization to introduce TESS, a temporally and spatially local learning rule for training SNNs. Our approach addresses both temporal and spatial credit assignments by relying solely on locally available signals within each neuron, thereby allowing computational and memory overheads to scale linearly with the number of neurons, independently of the number of time steps. Despite relying on local mechanisms, we demonstrate performance comparable to the backpropagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, within $\sim1.4$ accuracy points on challenging computer vision scenarios relevant at the edge, such as the IBM DVS Gesture dataset, CIFAR10-DVS, and temporal versions of CIFAR10, and CIFAR100. Being able to produce comparable performance to BPTT while keeping low time and memory complexity, TESS enables efficient and scalable on-device learning at the edge.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Although typically defined as utility-driven technologies designed for productive or social settings, the role of robots in creative settings remains underexplored. This paper examines how robots participate in artistic creation. Through semi-structured interviews with robotic artists, we analyze the impact of robots on artistic processes and outcomes. We identify the critical roles of social interaction, material properties, and temporal dynamics in facilitating creativity. Our findings reveal that creativity emerges from the co-constitution of artists, robots, and audiences within spatial-temporal dimensions. Based on these insights, we propose several implications for socially informed, material-attentive, and process-oriented approaches to creation with computing systems. These approaches can inform the domains of HCI, including media and art creation, craft, digital fabrication, and tangible computing.</p></details> | In press in CHI'25 |

The resulting interactions are recorded at heterogeneous temporal resolutions across these domains. This multi-channel data can be combined and encoded to create a comprehensive representation of the customer's journey for accurate intent prediction. This demands sequential learning solutions. NMT transformers achieve state-of-the-art sequential representation learning by encoding context and decoding for the next best action to represent long-range dependencies. However, three major challenges exist while combining multi-domain sequences within an encoder-decoder transformers architecture for intent prediction applications: a) aligning sequences with different sampling rates b) learning temporal dynamics across multi-variate, multi-domain sequences c) combining dynamic and static sequences. We propose an encoder-decoder transformer model to address these challenges for contextual and sequential intent prediction in financial servicing applications.

This inefficiency primarily arises from the quadratic computational complexity of 3D Full Attention with respect to the context length. In this paper, we propose a training-free framework termed Sparse VideoGen (SVG) that leverages the inherent sparsity in 3D Full Attention to boost inference efficiency. We reveal that the attention heads can be dynamically classified into two groups depending on distinct sparse patterns: (1) Spatial Head, where only spatially-related tokens within each frame dominate the attention output, and (2) Temporal Head, where only temporally-related tokens across different frames dominate. Based on this insight, SVG proposes an online profiling strategy to capture the dynamic sparse patterns and predicts the type of attention head. Combined with a novel hardware-efficient tensor layout transformation and customized kernel implementations, SVG achieves up to 2.28x and 2.33x end-to-end speedup on CogVideoX-v1.5 and HunyuanVideo, respectively, while preserving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Furthermore, we present TReMu, a new framework aimed at enhancing the temporal reasoning capabilities of LLM-agents in this context. Specifically, the framework employs \textit{time-aware memorization} through timeline summarization, generating retrievable memory by summarizing events in each dialogue session with their inferred dates. Additionally, we integrate \textit{neuro-symbolic temporal reasoning}, where LLMs generate Python code to perform temporal calculations and select answers. Experimental evaluations on popular LLMs demonstrate that our benchmark is challenging, and the proposed framework significantly improves temporal reasoning performance compared to baseline methods, raising from 29.83 on GPT-4o via standard prompting to 77.67 via our approach and highlighting its effectiveness in addressing temporal reasoning in multi-session dialogues.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-consistent CAMs for Weakly Supervised Video Segmentation in Waste Sorting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01455v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In industrial settings, weakly supervised (WS) methods are usually preferred over their fully supervised (FS) counterparts as they do not require costly manual annotations. Unfortunately, the segmentation masks obtained in the WS regime are typically poor in terms of accuracy. In this work, we present a WS method capable of producing accurate masks for semantic segmentation in the case of video streams. More specifically, we build saliency maps that exploit the temporal coherence between consecutive frames in a video, promoting consistency when objects appear in different frames. We apply our method in a waste-sorting scenario, where we perform weakly supervised video segmentation (WSVS) by training an auxiliary classifier that distinguishes between videos recorded before and after a human operator, who manually removes specific wastes from a conveyor belt. The saliency maps of this classifier identify materials to be removed, and we modify the classifier training to minimize differences between the saliency map of a central frame and those in adjacent frames, after having compensated object displacement. Experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the benefits of integrating temporal coherence directly during the training phase of the classifier. Code and dataset are available upon request.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8\% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project's success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM terratorch, with additional resources on GitHub. The project exemplifies the Trusted Open Science approach embraced by all involved organizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dismountability in Temporal Cliques Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01321v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal graph is a graph whose edges are available only at certain points in time. It is temporally connected if the nodes can reach each other by paths that traverse the edges chronologically (temporal paths). In general, temporal graphs do not always admit small subsets of edges that preserve connectivity (temporal spanners). In the case of temporal cliques, spanners of size $O(n\log n)$ are guaranteed. The original proof by Casteigts et al. [ICALP 2019] combines a number of techniques, one of which is dismountability. In a recent work, Angrick et al. [ESA 2024] simplified the proof and showed, among other things, that a one-sided version of dismountability can be used to replace the second part of the proof. In this paper, we revisit the dismountability principle. We characterizing the structure that a temporal clique has if it is not 1-hop dismountable, then not {1,2}-hop dismountable, and finally not {1,2,3}-hop dismountable. It turns out that if a clique is k-hop dismountable for any other k, then it must also be {1,2,3}-hop dismountable. Interestingly, excluding only 1-hop and 2-hop dismountability is already sufficient for reducing the spanner problem from cliques to bi-cliques. Put together with the strategy of Angrick et al., the entire $O(n \log n)$ result can now be recovered using only dismountability. An interesting by-product of our analysis is that any minimal counter-example to the existence of $4n$ spanners must satisfy the properties of non {1,2,3}-hop dismountable cliques. In the second part, we discuss connections between dismountability and pivotability. We show that recursively k-hop dismountable cliques are pivotable (and thus admits $2n$ spanners, whatever k). We define a family of labelings (called full-range) which force both dismountability and pivotability and that gives some evidence that large lifetimes could be exploited more generally.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyGMamba: Efficiently Modeling Long-Term Temporal Dependency on Continuous-Time Dynamic Graphs with State Space Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04713v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning useful representations for continuous-time dynamic graphs (CTDGs) is challenging, due to the concurrent need to span long node interaction histories and grasp nuanced temporal details. In particular, two problems emerge: (1) Encoding longer histories requires more computational resources, making it crucial for CTDG models to maintain low computational complexity to ensure efficiency; (2) Meanwhile, more powerful models are needed to identify and select the most critical temporal information within the extended context provided by longer histories. To address these problems, we propose a CTDG representation learning model named DyGMamba, originating from the popular Mamba state space model (SSM). DyGMamba first leverages a node-level SSM to encode the sequence of historical node interactions. Another time-level SSM is then employed to exploit the temporal patterns hidden in the historical graph, where its output is used to dynamically select the critical information from the interaction history. We validate DyGMamba experimentally on the dynamic link prediction task. The results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art in most cases. DyGMamba also maintains high efficiency in terms of computational resources, making it possible to capture long temporal dependencies with a limited computation budget.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[On the Robustness of Temporal Factual Knowledge in Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01220v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the temporal robustness of language models (LMs) in handling factual knowledge. While LMs can often complete simple factual statements, their ability to manage temporal facts (those valid only within specific timeframes) remains uncertain. We design a controlled experiment to test the robustness of temporal factual knowledge inside LMs, which we use to evaluate several pretrained and instruction-tuned models using prompts on popular Wikidata facts, assessing their performance across different temporal granularities (Day, Month, and Year). Our findings indicate that even very large state-of-the-art models, such as Llama-3.1-70B, vastly lack robust knowledge of temporal facts. In addition, they are incapable of generalizing their knowledge from one granularity to another. These results highlight the inherent limitations of using LMs as temporal knowledge bases. The source code and data to reproduce our experiments will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gaussian Temporal Difference Error for Uncertainty-aware Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02295v3)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional uncertainty-aware temporal difference (TD) learning often assumes a zero-mean Gaussian distribution for TD errors, leading to inaccurate error representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. We introduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep reinforcement learning to enhance the flexibility of error distribution modeling by incorporating additional higher-order moment, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving the estimation and mitigation of data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form expression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and the shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded weighting scheme to address epistemic uncertainty by fully leveraging the GGD. We refine batch inverse variance weighting with bias reduction and kurtosis considerations, enhancing robustness. Experiments with policy gradient algorithms demonstrate significant performance gains.</p></details> |  |

To advance this task, we introduce TESRBench, a comprehensive benchmark for temporal event sequence retrieval (TESR) from textual descriptions. TESRBench includes diverse real-world datasets with synthesized and reviewed textual descriptions, providing a strong foundation for evaluating retrieval performance and addressing challenges in this domain. Building on this benchmark, we propose TPP-Embedding, a novel model for embedding and retrieving event sequences. The model leverages the TPP-LLM framework, integrating large language models (LLMs) with temporal point processes (TPPs) to encode both event texts and times. By pooling representations and applying a contrastive loss, it unifies temporal dynamics and event semantics in a shared embedding space, aligning sequence-level embeddings of event sequences and their descriptions. TPP-Embedding demonstrates superior performance over baseline models across TESRBench datasets, establishing it as a powerful solution for the temporal event sequence retrieval task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Progressive Attention Model for EEG Classification in Rapid Serial Visual Presentation Task](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00730v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a type of multi-dimensional sequential data, the spatial and temporal dependencies of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals should be further investigated. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel spatial-temporal progressive attention model (STPAM) to improve EEG classification in rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) tasks. STPAM first adopts three distinct spatial experts to learn the spatial topological information of brain regions progressively, which is used to minimize the interference of irrelevant brain regions. Concretely, the former expert filters out EEG electrodes in the relative brain regions to be used as prior knowledge for the next expert, ensuring that the subsequent experts gradually focus their attention on information from significant EEG electrodes. This process strengthens the effect of the important brain regions. Then, based on the above-obtained feature sequence with spatial information, three temporal experts are adopted to capture the temporal dependence by progressively assigning attention to the crucial EEG slices. Except for the above EEG classification method, in this paper, we build a novel Infrared RSVP EEG Dataset (IRED) which is based on dim infrared images with small targets for the first time, and conduct extensive experiments on it. The results show that our STPAM can achieve better performance than all the compared methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[EKF-Based Radar-Inertial Odometry with Online Temporal Calibration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00661v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate time synchronization between heterogeneous sensors is crucial for ensuring robust state estimation in multi-sensor fusion systems. Sensor delays often cause discrepancies between the actual time when the event was captured and the time of sensor measurement, leading to temporal misalignment (time offset) between sensor measurement streams. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filter (EKF)-based radar-inertial odometry (RIO) framework that estimates the time offset online. The radar ego-velocity measurement model, estimated from a single radar scan, is formulated to include the time offset for the update. By leveraging temporal calibration, the proposed RIO enables accurate propagation and measurement updates based on a common time stream. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrated the accurate time offset estimation of the proposed method and its impact on RIO performance, validating the importance of sensor time synchronization. Our implementation of the EKF-RIO with online temporal calibration is available at https://github.com/spearwin/EKF-RIO-TC.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

For this purpose, spatial homogeneity and temporal stationarity are widely used assumptions, and many parametric covariance models have been developed under these assumptions. However, these are strong and unrealistic conditions in many cases. In addition, on the sphere, although different statistical approaches from those on Euclidean space should be applied to build a proper covariance model considering its unique characteristics, relevant studies are rare. In this research, we introduce novel parameterized models of the covariance function for spatially non-homogeneous and temporally non-stationary random processes on the sphere. To alleviate the spatial homogeneity assumption and temporal stationarity, and to consider the spherical domain and time domain together, this research will apply the theories of Intrinsic Random Functions (IRF). We also provide a methodology to estimate the associated parameters for the model. Finally, through a simulation study and analysis of a real-world data set about global temperature anomaly, we demonstrate validity of the suggested covariance model with its advantage of interpretability.</p></details> |  |

Increased extreme weather events associated with climate change can result in alterations to river and stream connectivity. While traditional stream flow gauges are costly to deploy and limited to large river bodies, trail camera methods are a low-cost and easily deployed alternative to collect hourly data. Image capturing, however requires stream ecologists to manually curate (select and label) tens of thousands of images per year. To improve this workflow, we developed an automated instream trail camera image classification system consisting of three parts: (1) image processing, (2) image augmentation and (3) machine learning. The image preprocessing consists of seven image quality filters, foliage-based luma variance reduction, resizing and bottom-center cropping. Images are balanced using variable amount of generative augmentation using diffusion models and then passed to a machine learning classification model in labeled form. By using the vision transformer architecture and temporal image enhancement in our framework, we are able to increase the 75% base accuracy to 90% for a new unseen site image. We make use of a dataset captured and labeled by staff from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection between 2018-2020. Our results indicate that a combination of temporal image processing and attention-based models are effective at classifying unseen river connectivity images.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

Unlike traditional task-specific models, Video Large Language Models (video LLMs) can handle multiple tasks concurrently in a zero-shot manner. Consequently, exploring the application of video LLMs for VTG tasks has become a burgeoning research area. However, despite considerable advancements in video content understanding, video LLMs often struggle to accurately pinpoint timestamps within videos, limiting their effectiveness in VTG tasks. To address this, we introduce VTG-LLM, a model designed to enhance video LLMs' timestamp localization abilities. Our approach includes: (1) effectively integrating timestamp knowledge into visual tokens; (2) incorporating absolute-time tokens to manage timestamp knowledge without concept shifts; and (3) introducing a lightweight, high-performance, slot-based token compression technique designed to accommodate the demands of a large number of frames to be sampled for VTG tasks. Additionally, we present VTG-IT-120K, a collection of publicly available VTG datasets that we have re-annotated to improve upon low-quality annotations. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of VTG-LLM in comparison to other video LLM methods across a variety of VTG tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |

Existing state-of-the-art methods, like Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), achieve high imputation accuracy; however, they suffer from significant computational costs and are notably time-consuming due to their iterative nature. In this work, we propose CoSTI, an innovative adaptation of Consistency Models (CMs) for the MTSI domain. CoSTI employs Consistency Training to achieve comparable imputation quality to DDPMs while drastically reducing inference times, making it more suitable for real-time applications. We evaluate CoSTI across multiple datasets and missing data scenarios, demonstrating up to a 98% reduction in imputation time with performance on par with diffusion-based models. This work bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in generative imputation tasks, providing a scalable solution for handling missing data in critical spatio-temporal systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |

To this end, we present a novel approach to generate large-scale, high-resolution canopy height maps over time. Our model accurately predicts canopy height over multiple years given Sentinel-2 time series satellite data. Using GEDI LiDAR data as the ground truth for training the model, we present the first 10m resolution temporal canopy height map of the European continent for the period 2019-2022. As part of this product, we also offer a detailed canopy height map for 2020, providing more precise estimates than previous studies.

Existing event-based lip-reading solutions integrate different frame rate branches to learn spatio-temporal features of varying granularities. However, aggregating events into event frames inevitably leads to the loss of fine-grained temporal information within frames. To remedy this drawback, we propose a novel framework termed Multi-view Temporal Granularity aligned Aggregation (MTGA). Specifically, we first present a novel event representation method, namely time-segmented voxel graph list, where the most significant local voxels are temporally connected into a graph list. Then we design a spatio-temporal fusion module based on temporal granularity alignment, where the global spatial features extracted from event frames, together with the local relative spatial and temporal features contained in voxel graph list are effectively aligned and integrated. Finally, we design a temporal aggregation module that incorporates positional encoding, which enables the capture of local absolute spatial and global temporal information. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms both the event-based and video-based lip-reading counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Existing multi-modal LLMs usually standardize these diverse visual inputs to a fixed resolution for visual encoders and yield similar numbers of tokens for LLMs. This approach is non-optimal for multimodal understanding and inefficient for processing inputs with long and short visual contents. To solve the problem, we propose Oryx, a unified multimodal architecture for the spatial-temporal understanding of images, videos, and multi-view 3D scenes. Oryx offers an on-demand solution to seamlessly and efficiently process visual inputs with arbitrary spatial sizes and temporal lengths through two core innovations: 1) a pre-trained OryxViT model that can encode images at any resolution into LLM-friendly visual representations; 2) a dynamic compressor module that supports 1x to 16x compression on visual tokens by request. These design features enable Oryx to accommodate extremely long visual contexts, such as videos, with lower resolution and high compression while maintaining high recognition precision for tasks like document understanding with native resolution and no compression. Beyond the architectural improvements, enhanced data curation and specialized training on long-context retrieval and spatial-aware data help Oryx achieve strong capabilities in image, video, and 3D multimodal understanding simultaneously.

Our theory is a generalization of temporal causality, which has recently been proposed as a framework for drawing causal relationships between trace properties on a given trace. So far, algorithms exist only for verifying a single causal relationship and, as an extension, cause synthesis through enumeration, which is complete only for a small fragment of effect properties. This work presents the first complete cause-synthesis algorithm for the class of omega-regular effects. We show that in this case, causes are guaranteed to be omega-regular themselves and can be computed as, e.g., nondeterministic B\"uchi automata. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of this algorithm with a prototype tool and evaluate its performance for cause synthesis and cause checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version with appendix</p></details> |

In particular, recent advances incorporate the low-rankness of gradients, introducing low-rank ZO estimators to further reduce GPU memory consumption. However, most existing works focus solely on the low-rankness of each individual gradient, overlooking a broader property shared by all gradients throughout the training, i.e., all gradients approximately reside within a similar subspace. In this paper, we consider two factors together and propose a novel low-rank ZO estimator, TeZO, which captures the low-rankness across both the model and temporal dimension. Specifically, we represent ZO perturbations along the temporal dimension as a 3D tensor and employ Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) to extract each low-rank 2D matrix, significantly reducing the training cost. TeZO can also be easily extended to the Adam variant while consuming less memory than MeZO-SGD, and requiring about only 35% memory of MeZO-Adam. Both comprehensive theoretical analysis and extensive experimental research have validated its efficiency, achieving SOTA-comparable results with lower overhead of time and memory.</p></details> |  |

The hardness of choosing delays to meet passenger demands in temporal graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18987v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In train networks, carefully-chosen delays may be beneficial for certain passengers, who would otherwise miss some connection. Given a simple temporal graph and a set of passengers (each specifying a starting vertex, an ending vertex, and a desired arrival time), we ask whether it is possible to delay some of the edges of the temporal graph to realize all the passengers' demands. We call this problem DelayBetter (DB), and study it along with two variants: in $\delta$-DelayBetter, each delay must be of at most $\delta$; in Path DB, passengers fully specify the vertices they should visit on their journey. On the positive side, we give a polynomial-time algorithm for Path DB, and obtain as a corollary a polynomial-time algorithm for DB and $\delta$-DB on trees. We also provide an fpt algorithm for both problems parameterized by the size of the graph's Feedback Edge Set together with the number of passengers. On the negative side, we show NP-completeness of ($1$-)DB on bounded-degree temporal graphs even when the lifetime is $2$, and of ($10$-)DB on bounded-degree planar temporal graphs of lifetime $19$. Our results complement previous work studying reachability problems in temporal graphs with delaying operations. This is to our knowledge the first such problem in which the aim is to facilitate travel between specific points (as opposed to facilitating or impeding a broadcast from one or many sources).</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

While existing works did preliminary studies of generating holistic co-speech gesture from speech, the spatial interaction of each body region during the speech remains barely explored. This leads to wield body part interactions given the speech signal. Furthermore, the slow generation speed limits the construction of real-world digital avatars. To resolve these problems, we propose \textbf{GestureLSM}, a Latent Shortcut based approach for Co-Speech Gesture Generation with spatial-temporal modeling. We tokenize various body regions and explicitly model their interactions with spatial and temporal attention. To achieve real-time gesture generations, we exam the denoising patterns and design an effective time distribution to speed up sampling while improve the generation quality for shortcut model. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GestureLSM, showcasing its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.

Although the existing causal discovery methods have shown promising results in effective connectivity network analysis, they often overlook the dynamics of causality, in addition to the incorporation of spatio-temporal information in brain activity data. To address these issues, we propose a deep spatio-temporal fusion architecture, which employs a dynamic causal deep encoder to incorporate spatio-temporal information into dynamic causality modeling, and a dynamic causal deep decoder to verify the discovered causality. The effectiveness of the proposed method is first illustrated with simulated data. Then, experimental results from Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in inferring dECNs, which reveal the dynamic evolution of directed flow between brain regions. The analysis shows the difference of dECNs between young adults and children. Specifically, the directed brain functional networks transit from fluctuating undifferentiated systems to more stable specialized networks as one grows. This observation provides further evidence on the modularization and adaptation of brain networks during development, leading to higher cognitive abilities observed in young adults.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the efficacy of zero-shot LLMs in summarizing long clinical texts that require temporal reasoning, a critical aspect for comprehensively capturing patient histories and treatment trajectories. We applied a series of advanced zero-shot LLMs to extensive clinical documents, assessing their ability to integrate and accurately reflect temporal dynamics without prior task-specific training. While the models efficiently identified key temporal events, they struggled with chronological coherence over prolonged narratives. The evaluation, combining quantitative and qualitative methods, highlights the strengths and limitations of zero-shot LLMs in clinical text summarization. The results suggest that while promising, zero-shot LLMs require further refinement to effectively support clinical decision-making processes, underscoring the need for enhanced model training approaches that better capture the nuances of temporal information in long context medical documents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Preference Optimization for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13919v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in video large multimodal models (video-LMMs), achieving effective temporal grounding in long-form videos remains a challenge for existing models. To address this limitation, we propose Temporal Preference Optimization (TPO), a novel post-training framework designed to enhance the temporal grounding capabilities of video-LMMs through preference learning. TPO adopts a self-training approach that enables models to differentiate between well-grounded and less accurate temporal responses by leveraging curated preference datasets at two granularities: localized temporal grounding, which focuses on specific video segments, and comprehensive temporal grounding, which captures extended temporal dependencies across entire video sequences. By optimizing on these preference datasets, TPO significantly enhances temporal understanding while reducing reliance on manually annotated data. Extensive experiments on three long-form video understanding benchmarks--LongVideoBench, MLVU, and Video-MME--demonstrate the effectiveness of TPO across two state-of-the-art video-LMMs. Notably, LLaVA-Video-TPO establishes itself as the leading 7B model on the Video-MME benchmark, underscoring the potential of TPO as a scalable and efficient solution for advancing temporal reasoning in long-form video understanding.

| **[Quantifying community evolution in temporal networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10632v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we detect communities in temporal networks it is important to ask questions about how they change in time. Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) has been used to measure the similarity of communities when the nodes on a network do not change. We propose two extensions namely Union-Normalised Mutual Information (UNMI) and Intersection-Normalised Mutual Information (INMI). UNMI and INMI evaluate the similarity of community structure under the condition of node variation. Experiments show that these methods are effective in dealing with temporal networks with the changes in the set of nodes, and can capture the dynamic evolution of community structure in both synthetic and real temporal networks. This study not only provides a new similarity measurement method for network analysis but also helps to deepen the understanding of community change in complex temporal networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Coalitions in Games on Graphs with Preferences over Temporal Goals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18022v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multiplayer games with sequential decision-making, self-interested players form dynamic coalitions to achieve most-preferred temporal goals beyond their individual capabilities. We introduce a novel procedure to synthesize strategies that jointly determine which coalitions should form and the actions coalition members should choose to satisfy their preferences in a subclass of deterministic multiplayer games on graphs. In these games, a leader decides the coalition during each round and the players not in the coalition follow their admissible strategies. Our contributions are threefold. First, we extend the concept of admissibility to games on graphs with preferences and characterize it using maximal sure winning, a concept originally defined for adversarial two-player games with preferences. Second, we define a value function that assigns a vector to each state, identifying which player has a maximal sure winning strategy for certain subset of objectives. Finally, we present a polynomial-time algorithm to synthesize admissible strategies for all players based on this value function and prove their existence in all games within the chosen subclass. We illustrate the benefits of dynamic coalitions over fixed ones in a blocks-world domain. Interestingly, our experiment reveals that aligned preferences do not always encourage cooperation, while conflicting preferences do not always lead to adversarial behavior.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Time Makes Space: Emergence of Place Fields in Networks Encoding Temporally Continuous Sensory Experiences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05798v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The vertebrate hippocampus is believed to use recurrent connectivity in area CA3 to support episodic memory recall from partial cues. This brain area also contains place cells, whose location-selective firing fields implement maps supporting spatial memory. Here we show that place cells emerge in networks trained to remember temporally continuous sensory episodes. We model CA3 as a recurrent autoencoder that recalls and reconstructs sensory experiences from noisy and partially occluded observations by agents traversing simulated rooms. The agents move in realistic trajectories modeled from rodents and environments are modeled as high-dimensional sensory experience maps. Training our autoencoder to pattern-complete and reconstruct experiences with a constraint on total activity causes spatially localized firing fields, i.e., place cells, to emerge in the encoding layer. The emergent place fields reproduce key aspects of hippocampal phenomenology: a) remapping (maintenance of and reversion to distinct learned maps in different environments), implemented via repositioning of experience manifolds in the network's hidden layer, b) orthogonality of spatial representations in different arenas, c) robust place field emergence in differently shaped rooms, with single units showing multiple place fields in large or complex spaces, and d) slow representational drift of place fields. We argue that these results arise because continuous traversal of space makes sensory experience temporally continuous. We make testable predictions: a) rapidly changing sensory context will disrupt place fields, b) place fields will form even if recurrent connections are blocked, but reversion to previously learned representations upon remapping will be abolished, c) the dimension of temporally smooth experience sets the dimensionality of place fields, including during virtual navigation of abstract spaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parsimonious Hawkes Processes for temporal networks modelling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17720v1)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal networks are characterised by interdependent link events between nodes, forming ordered sequences of links that may represent specific information flows in the system. Nevertheless, representing temporal networks using discrete snapshots in time partially cancels the effect of time-ordered links on each other, while continuous time models, such as Poisson or Hawkes processes, can describe the full influence between all the potential pairs of links at all times. In this paper, we introduce a continuous Hawkes temporal network model which accounts both for a community structure of the aggregate network and a strong heterogeneity in the activity of individual nodes, thus accounting for the presence of highly heterogeneous clusters with isolated high-activity influencer nodes, communities and low-activity nodes. Our model improves the prediction performance of previously available continuous time network models, and obtains a systematic increase in log-likelihood. Characterising the direct interaction between influencer nodes and communities, we can provide a more detailed description of the system that can better outline the sequence of activations in the components of the systems represented by temporal networks.</p></details> | 19 pages |

The primary source of information for surgical phase recognition is typically video, which presents two challenges: extracting meaningful features from the video stream and effectively modeling temporal information in the sequence of visual features. Methods: For temporal modeling, attention mechanisms have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we explore design choices for attention in existing temporal models for surgical phase recognition and propose a novel approach that uses attention more effectively and does not require hand-crafted constraints: TUNeS, an efficient and simple temporal model that incorporates self-attention at the core of a convolutional U-Net structure. In addition, we propose to train the feature extractor, a standard CNN, together with an LSTM on preferably long video segments, i.e., with long temporal context. Results: In our experiments, almost all temporal models performed better on top of feature extractors that were trained with longer temporal context. On these contextualized features, TUNeS achieves state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset. Conclusion: This study offers new insights on how to use attention mechanisms to build accurate and efficient temporal models for surgical phase recognition. Significance: Implementing automatic surgical phase recognition is essential to automate the analysis and optimization of surgical workflows and to enable context-aware computer assistance during surgery, thus ultimately improving patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Brightness Management for Immersive Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14853v2)** | 2025-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern virtual reality headsets demand significant computational resources to render high-resolution content in real-time. Therefore, prioritizing power efficiency becomes crucial, particularly for portable versions reliant on batteries. A significant portion of the energy consumed by these systems is attributed to their displays. Dimming the screen can save a considerable amount of energy; however, it may also result in a loss of visible details and contrast in the displayed content. While contrast may be partially restored by applying post-processing contrast enhancement steps, our work is orthogonal to these approaches, and focuses on optimal temporal modulation of screen brightness. We propose a technique that modulates brightness over time while minimizing the potential loss of visible details and avoiding noticeable temporal instability. Given a predetermined power budget and a video sequence, we achieve this by measuring contrast loss through band decomposition of the luminance image and optimizing the brightness level of each frame offline to ensure uniform temporal contrast loss. We evaluate our method through a series of subjective experiments and an ablation study, on a variety of content. We showcase its power-saving capabilities in practice using a built-in hardware proxy. Finally, we present an online version of our approach which further emphasizes the potential for low level vision models to be leveraged in power saving settings to preserve content quality.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Multi-Agent Collaborative Intelligence (MACI), a framework comprising three key components: 1) a meta-planner (MP) that identifies, formulates, and refines all roles and constraints of a task (e.g., wedding planning) while generating a dependency graph, with common-sense augmentation to ensure realistic and practical constraints; 2) a collection of agents to facilitate planning and address task-specific requirements; and 3) a run-time monitor that manages plan adjustments as needed. By decoupling planning from validation, maintaining minimal agent context, and integrating common-sense reasoning, MACI overcomes the aforementioned limitations and demonstrates robust performance in two scheduling problems.</p></details> | 21 pages, 19 tables |

A novel framework was introduced, leveraging Temporal-Correlation Graphs to model the intricate relationships and temporal patterns inherent in malicious operations. The approach dynamically captured behavioral anomalies, offering a robust mechanism for distinguishing between benign and malicious activities in real-time scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrated the framework's effectiveness across diverse ransomware families, with consistently high precision, recall, and overall detection accuracy. Comparative evaluations highlighted its better performance over traditional signature-based and heuristic methods, particularly in handling polymorphic and previously unseen ransomware variants. The architecture was designed with scalability and modularity in mind, ensuring compatibility with enterprise-scale environments while maintaining resource efficiency. Analysis of encryption speeds, anomaly patterns, and temporal correlations provided deeper insights into the operational strategies of ransomware, validating the framework's adaptability to evolving threats. The research contributes to advancing cybersecurity technologies by integrating dynamic graph analytics and machine learning for future innovations in threat detection. Results from this study underline the potential for transforming the way organizations detect and mitigate complex cyberattacks.</p></details> |  |

We focus on agents that respond solely to odor stimuli, with no access to spatial perception nor prior information about the odor. We ask whether navigation to a target can be learned robustly within a sequential decision making framework. We develop a reinforcement learning algorithm using a small set of interpretable olfactory states and train it with realistic turbulent odor cues. By introducing a temporal memory, we demonstrate that two salient features of odor traces, discretized in few olfactory states, are sufficient to learn navigation in a realistic odor plume. Performance is dictated by the sparse nature of turbulent odors. An optimal memory exists which ignores blanks within the plume and activates a recovery strategy outside the plume. We obtain the best performance by letting agents learn their recovery strategy and show that it is mostly casting cross wind, similar to behavior observed in flying insects. The optimal strategy is robust to substantial changes in the odor plumes, suggesting minor parameter tuning may be sufficient to adapt to different environments.</p></details> | 26 pages, 10 figures |

As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[HGTUL: A Hypergraph-based Model For Trajectory User Linking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07549v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory User Linking (TUL), which links anonymous trajectories with users who generate them, plays a crucial role in modeling human mobility. Despite significant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the high-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations among multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence patterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest (POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on different trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by disparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory User Linking model (HGTUL). Our model learns trajectory representations from both relational and spatio-temporal perspectives: (1) it captures high-order associations among trajectories by constructing a trajectory hypergraph and leverages a hypergraph attention network to learn the variable impact of POIs on trajectories; (2) it models the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories by incorporating their temporal and spatial information into a sequential encoder. Moreover, we design a data balancing method to effectively address the user class imbalance problem and experimentally validate its significance in TUL. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGTUL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 2.57%~20.09% and 5.68%~26.00% in ACC@1 and Macro-F1 metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PLMTrajRec: A Scalable and Generalizable Trajectory Recovery Method with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is crucial for various applications. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Semantic Representation for Navigational Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02737v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07178v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reward-Based Collision-Free Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06149v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new mission planning algorithm for autonomous robots that enables the reward-based selection of an optimal waypoint sequence from a predefined set. The algorithm computes a feasible trajectory and corresponding control inputs for a robot to navigate between waypoints while avoiding obstacles, maximizing the total reward, and adhering to constraints on state, input and its derivatives, mission time window, and maximum distance. This also solves a generalized prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. The proposed algorithm employs a new genetic algorithm that evolves solution candidates toward the optimal solution based on a fitness function and crossover. During fitness evaluation, a penalty method enforces constraints, and the differential flatness property with clothoid curves efficiently penalizes infeasible trajectories. The Euler spiral method showed promising results for trajectory parameterization compared to minimum snap and jerk polynomials. Due to the discrete exploration space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. A mutation step enhances exploration. Results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to find the optimal waypoint sequence, fulfill constraints, avoid infeasible waypoints, and prioritize high-reward ones. Simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped are presented, complemented by benchmarking and a time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (<1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

Traditional approaches usually focus on static road network and trajectory representation learning, and overlook the dynamic nature of traffic states and trajectories, which is crucial for downstream tasks. To address this gap, we propose TRACK, a novel framework to bridge traffic state and trajectory data for dynamic road network and trajectory representation learning. TRACK leverages graph attention networks (GAT) to encode static and spatial road segment features, and introduces a transformer-based model for trajectory representation learning. By incorporating transition probabilities from trajectory data into GAT attention weights, TRACK captures dynamic spatial features of road segments. Meanwhile, TRACK designs a traffic transformer encoder to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of road segments from traffic state data. To further enhance dynamic representations, TRACK proposes a co-attentional transformer encoder and a trajectory-traffic state matching task. Extensive experiments on real-life urban traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of TRACK over state-of-the-art baselines. Case studies confirm TRACK's ability to capture spatial-temporal dynamics effectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60. Experiments performed on two wildlife migration datasets demonstrate that our proposed method improves the generalization of the generated trajectories in comparison to existing work while achieving superior or comparable performance in several benchmark metrics.

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Here, such characterization for the optimal learning trajectories is associated with the solution of an optimal control problem for a weakly-controlled gradient system with small parameters, whose time-evolution is guided by a model training dataset and its perturbed version, while the optimization problem consists of a cost functional that summarizes how to gauge the quality/performance of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time w.r.t. a model validating dataset.

Despite growing interest, recent approaches often struggle with two major challenges: multi-dancer collisions and single-dancer foot sliding. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff) framework, which leverages non-overlapping trajectories to ensure coherent and aesthetically pleasing dance movements. To mitigate collisions, we introduce a Dance-Trajectory Navigator that generates collision-free trajectories for multiple dancers, utilizing a distance-consistency loss to maintain optimal spacing. Furthermore, to reduce foot sliding, we present a footwork adaptor that adjusts trajectory displacement between frames, supported by a relative forward-kinematic loss to further reinforce the correlation between movements and trajectories. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^3$PC: Test-time Model Predictive Control for Pretrained Masked Trajectory Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05675v2)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work in Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown that a unified Transformer trained under a masked auto-encoding objective can effectively capture the relationships between different modalities (e.g., states, actions, rewards) within given trajectory datasets. However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

| **[Spatiotemporal Trajectory Tracking Method for Vehicles Incorporating Lead-Lag Judgement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03974v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of intelligent transportation systems, especially within the context of autonomous vehicle control, the preemptive holistic collaborative system has been presented as a promising solution to bring a remarkable enhancement in traffic efficiency and a substantial reduction in the accident rate, demonstrating a great potential of development. In order to ensure this system operates as intended, accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal trajectory is of crucial significance. Moreover, minimizing the tracking error is a necessary step in this process. To this end, a novel lead-lag judgment mechanism is proposed. This mechanism precisely quantifies the longitudinal positional deviation between the vehicle and the target trajectory over time, then the deviation is corrected with a real - time acceleration compensation strategy, as a result, the accuracy and reliability of trajectory tracking are significantly enhanced. Real - vehicle experiments were conducted in a dedicated test field to validate the feasibility of this innovative approach empirically. Subsequently, the obtained tracking data was subsequent processed using the lead-lag judgment mechanism. In this step, we carefully analyzed the spatiotemporal error patterns between the vehicle and the target trajectory under different alignments and speeds. Finally, using real highway speed and alignment data, we conducted comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory tracking simulations. Through experiments and simulations, tracking errors maintained in an acceptable range and reasonable spatiotemporal distance is given during the preemptive merging process on highway ramps. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for highway ramp emerging safety. Future work can expand on these findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduce Lap Time for Autonomous Racing with Curvature-Integrated MPCC Local Trajectory Planning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03695v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of autonomous driving technology has significantly advanced the field of autonomous racing. Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) is a highly effective local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. However, the traditional MPCC method struggles with racetracks that have significant curvature changes, limiting the performance of the vehicle during autonomous racing. To address this issue, we propose a curvature-integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. This method optimizes the velocity of the local trajectory based on the curvature of the racetrack centerline. The specific implementation involves mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline to a reference velocity profile, which is then incorporated into the cost function for optimizing the velocity of the local trajectory. This reference velocity profile is created by normalizing and mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline, thereby ensuring efficient and performance-oriented local trajectory planning in racetracks with significant curvature. The proposed CiMPCC method has been experimented on a self-built 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing vehicle deployed with ROS platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding results on a challenging racetrack with sharp curvature, improving the overall lap time by 11.4%-12.5% compared to other autonomous racing trajectory planning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/CiMPCC.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is to identify guide paths that approximately track the reference trajectory and strategically bias sampling toward the guide paths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by restructuring two existing graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms and evaluating the updated algorithms in three experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |
| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, applying these models requires inferring their specifications from observed behaviors -- a challenging task known as the inverse game problem. Existing inverse game approaches often struggle to account for behavioral uncertainty and measurement noise, and leverage both offline and online data. To address these limitations, we propose an inverse game method that integrates a generative trajectory model into a differentiable mixed-strategy game framework. By representing the mixed strategy with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), our method can infer high-dimensional, multi-modal behavior distributions from noisy measurements while adapting in real-time to new observations. We extensively evaluate our method in a simulated navigation benchmark, where the observations are generated by an unknown game model. Despite the model mismatch, our method can infer Nash-optimal actions comparable to those of the ground-truth model and the oracle inverse game baseline, even in the presence of uncertain agent objectives and noisy measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025. 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{-\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

However, efficiently training video diffusion models capable of integrating directional guidance and controllable motion intensity remains a challenging and under-explored area. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Mojito, a diffusion model that incorporates both motion trajectory and intensity control for text-to-video generation. Specifically, Mojito features a Directional Motion Control (DMC) module that leverages cross-attention to efficiently direct the generated object's motion without training, alongside a Motion Intensity Modulator (MIM) that uses optical flow maps generated from videos to guide varying levels of motion intensity. Extensive experiments demonstrate Mojito's effectiveness in achieving precise trajectory and intensity control with high computational efficiency, generating motion patterns that closely match specified directions and intensities, providing realistic dynamics that align well with natural motion in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Unified Spatial-Temporal Edge-Enhanced Graph Networks for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02504v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction aims to forecast future movements based on historical paths. Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p></details> |  |

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, handed in for possible publication at IEEE IV 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |
| **[One Diffusion Step to Real-World Super-Resolution via Flow Trajectory Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01993v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have significantly advanced the development of real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR), but the computational cost of multi-step diffusion models limits their application. One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods.

| **[Enhancing Generalization via Sharpness-Aware Trajectory Matching for Dataset Condensation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01865v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset condensation aims to synthesize datasets with a few representative samples that can effectively represent the original datasets. This enables efficient training and produces models with performance close to those trained on the original sets. Most existing dataset condensation methods conduct dataset learning under the bilevel (inner- and outer-loop) based optimization. However, the preceding methods perform with limited dataset generalization due to the notoriously complicated loss landscape and expensive time-space complexity of the inner-loop unrolling of bilevel optimization. These issues deteriorate when the datasets are learned via matching the trajectories of networks trained on the real and synthetic datasets with a long horizon inner-loop. To address these issues, we introduce Sharpness-Aware Trajectory Matching (SATM), which enhances the generalization capability of learned synthetic datasets by optimising the sharpness of the loss landscape and objective simultaneously. Moreover, our approach is coupled with an efficient hypergradient approximation that is mathematically well-supported and straightforward to implement along with controllable computational overhead. Empirical evaluations of SATM demonstrate its effectiveness across various applications, including in-domain benchmarks and out-of-domain settings. Moreover, its easy-to-implement properties afford flexibility, allowing it to integrate with other advanced sharpness-aware minimizers. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to integrate into our movement trajectory platform. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent SOTA models where we show highly accurate error detection, the ability to improve accuracy with a changing test distribution, and accuracy improvement for the base use case in addition to a suite of theoretical properties that informed algorithm development. Specifically, we show an F1 scores for predicting errors of up to 0.984, significant performance increase for out-of distribution accuracy (8.51% improvement over SOTA for zero-shot accuracy), and accuracy improvement over the SOTA model.</p></details> |  |

We introduce UniTraj, a unified dataset comprising over one million trajectories from 80 environments, designed to scale data while preserving critical diversity. Additionally, we propose TrajWorld, a novel architecture capable of flexibly handling varying sensor and actuator information and capturing environment dynamics in-context. Pre-training TrajWorld on UniTraj demonstrates significant improvements in transition prediction and achieves a new state-of-the-art for off-policy evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this work, for the first time, demonstrates the transfer benefits of world models across heterogeneous and complex control environments.</p></details> |  |

Its main advantage lies in its robust model-free decision-making in complex and large-dimension wireless environments. However, most existing RL frameworks rely on online interaction with the environment, which might not be feasible due to safety and cost concerns. Another problem with online RL is the lack of scalability of the designed algorithm with dynamic or new environments. This work proposes a novel, resilient, few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm combining offline RL using conservative Q-learning (CQL) and meta-learning using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The proposed algorithm can train RL models using static offline datasets without any online interaction with the environments. In addition, with the aid of MAML, the proposed model can be scaled up to new unseen environments. We showcase the proposed algorithm for optimizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 's trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize the age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power of limited-power devices. Numerical results show that the proposed few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm converges faster than baseline schemes, such as deep Q-networks and CQL. In addition, it is the only algorithm that can achieve optimal joint AoI and transmission power using an offline dataset with few shots of data points and is resilient to network failures due to unprecedented environmental changes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://github.com/tuantuange/Lt-Di.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting large-scale trajectory datasets is challenging due to factors such as commercial conflicts and privacy regulations. Therefore, we urgently need trajectory generation techniques to address this issue. Existing trajectory generation methods rely on the global road network structure of cities. When the road network structure changes, these methods are often not transferable to other cities. In fact, there exist invariant mobility patterns between different cities: 1) People prefer paths with the minimal travel cost; 2) The travel cost of roads has an invariant relationship with the topological features of the road network. Based on the above insight, this paper proposes a Generalizable Trajectory Generation model (GTG). The model consists of three parts: 1) Extracting city-invariant road representation based on Space Syntax method; 2) Cross-city travel cost prediction through disentangled adversarial training; 3) Travel preference learning by shortest path search and preference update. By learning invariant movement patterns, the model is capable of generating trajectories in new cities. Experiments on three datasets demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms existing models in terms of generalization ability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach enables the CAV agent to achieve superior performance in trajectory control compared to the baseline agents in terms of sample efficiency, traffic flow smoothness and traffic mobility.

In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning task/domain-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer procedures? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. Edited by adding noises and denoising with the pre-trained diffusion model, source domain trajectories can be transformed to align with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process effectively corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in source data, and allowing flexible integration with various single-domain and cross-domain downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |

Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |

Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown 'competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Optimization Trajectories Explain Multi-Task Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14677v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap (a gap in generalization at comparable training loss) between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; Published in TMLR</p></details> |

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025. v2: - A Github link to the proposed optimization tool is added. - There are no changes in the method and results</p></details> |
| **[Impedance Trajectory Analysis during Power Swing for Grid-Forming Inverter with Different Current Limiters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18063v1)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grid-forming (GFM) inverter-based resources (IBRs) are capable of emulating the external characteristics of synchronous generators (SGs) through the careful design of the control loops. However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs), widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. Furthermore, the corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the distance relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory or its failure to pass through the detection zones. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional grasping tasks where the object's geometry is assumed simple, we aim to achieve a "dynamic grasp" of the irregular objects, which requires continuous adjustment during the grasping process. To effectively handle irregular objects, we propose a trajectory optimization framework that comprises two phases. Firstly, in a specified time limit of 10s, initial offline trajectories are computed for a seamless motion from an initial configuration of the robot to grasp the object and deliver it to a pre-defined target location. Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented to update robot trajectories in real-time within 100 ms. This helps to mitigate pose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model inaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking controllers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the optimal trajectories from the proposed framework. The intensive experimental results effectively demonstrate the performance of our trajectory planning framework in both simulation and real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

Unlike GPS trackers which emit satellite signals from the animal's location, acoustic receivers are akin to stationary motion sensors that record movements within their detection range. Thus, for periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we devise and implement a simulation-based imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and random-walk principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Target-driven Self-Distillation for Partial Observed Trajectories Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16767v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories of traffic agents is essential for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, partially observed trajectories can significantly degrade the performance of even state-of-the-art models. Previous approaches often rely on knowledge distillation to transfer features from fully observed trajectories to partially observed ones. This involves firstly training a fully observed model and then using a distillation process to create the final model. While effective, they require multi-stage training, making the training process very expensive. Moreover, knowledge distillation can lead to a performance degradation of the model. In this paper, we introduce a Target-driven Self-Distillation method (TSD) for motion forecasting. Our method leverages predicted accurate targets to guide the model in making predictions under partial observation conditions. By employing self-distillation, the model learns from the feature distributions of both fully observed and partially observed trajectories during a single end-to-end training process. This enhances the model's ability to predict motion accurately in both fully observed and partially observed scenarios. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and state-of-the-art motion forecasting models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements in both settings. To facilitate further research, we will release our code and model checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

Our path planner replans for robots by utilizing a hierarchical approach, dividing the workspace, and computing collision-free paths for robots within each cell in parallel. Distributed trajectory optimization generates a deadlock-free trajectory for efficient execution and maintains the control feasibility even when the optimization fails. Our hierarchical approach combines the benefits of both centralized and decentralized methods, achieving a high task success rate while providing real-time replanning capability. Compared to decentralized approaches, our approach effectively avoids deadlocks and collisions, significantly increasing the task success rate.

| **[Toward Safe Integration of UAM in Terminal Airspace: UAM Route Feasibility Assessment using Probabilistic Aircraft Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16599v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating Urban Air Mobility (UAM) into airspace managed by Air Traffic Control (ATC) poses significant challenges, particularly in congested terminal environments. This study proposes a framework to assess the feasibility of UAM route integration using probabilistic aircraft trajectory prediction. By leveraging conditional Normalizing Flows, the framework predicts short-term trajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, enabling UAM vehicles to dynamically adjust speeds and maintain safe separations. The methodology was applied to airspace over Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing interactions between UAM and conventional traffic at multiple altitudes and lanes. The results reveal that different physical locations of lanes and routes experience varying interaction patterns and encounter dynamics. For instance, Lane 1 at lower altitudes (1,500 ft and 2,000 ft) exhibited minimal interactions with conventional aircraft, resulting in the largest separations and the most stable delay proportions. In contrast, Lane 4 near the airport experienced more frequent and complex interactions due to its proximity to departing traffic. The limited trajectory data for departing aircraft in this region occasionally led to tighter separations and increased operational challenges. This study underscores the potential of predictive modeling in facilitating UAM integration while highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and efficiency. The findings contribute to refining airspace management strategies and offer insights for scaling UAM operations in complex urban environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

We investigate the influence of inductive bias, size of training data and data augmentation strategy by training the models on Argoverse 2 (A2) and testing on Waymo Open Motion (WO) and vice versa. We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability. We discuss possible reasons for this surprising finding and draw conclusions about the design and test of trajectory prediction models and benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2407.13431</p></details> |

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 50\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction using Scene Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13848v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrian trajectories is crucial for enhancing the safety of autonomous vehicles and reducing traffic fatalities involving pedestrians. While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |
| **[In-Trajectory Inverse Reinforcement Learning: Learn Incrementally Before An Ongoing Trajectory Terminates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15612v5)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to learn a reward function and a corresponding policy that best fit the demonstrated trajectories of an expert. However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Following this approach, in this work we propose a closed-loop neuromorphic control system for an event-based robotic arm. The proposed system consists of a shifted Winner-Take-All spiking network for interpolating a reference trajectory and a spiking comparator network responsible for controlling the flow continuity of the trajectory, which is fed back to the actual position of the robot. The comparator model is based on a differential position comparison neural network, which governs the execution of the next trajectory points to close the control loop between both components of the system. To evaluate the system, we implemented and deployed the model on a mixed-signal analog-digital neuromorphic platform, the DYNAP-SE2, to facilitate integration and communication with the ED-Scorbot robotic arm platform. Experimental results on one joint of the robot validate the use of this architecture and pave the way for future neuro-inspired control of the entire robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, conference, ISCAS 2025, accepted for publication, Spiking Neural Network</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge-Informed Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction at Signalized Intersections for Infrastructure-to-Everything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13461v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent trajectory prediction at signalized intersections is crucial for developing efficient intelligent transportation systems and safe autonomous driving systems. Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight.

Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |

The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we present TAME, the Temporal Audio-based Mamba for Enhanced Drone Trajectory Estimation and Classification. This innovative anti-UAV detection model leverages a parallel selective state-space model to simultaneously capture and learn both the temporal and spectral features of audio, effectively analyzing propagation of sound. To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention.

| **[Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698v5)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Three-dimensional Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotor Tail-sitter UAVs: Traversing through Given Waypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the evolving application scenarios of current fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary for UAVs to possess agile and rapid 3-dimensional flight capabilities. Typically, the trajectory of a tail-sitter is generated separately for vertical and level flights. This limits the tail-sitter's ability to move in a 3-dimensional airspace and makes it difficult to establish a smooth transition between vertical and level flights. In the present work, a 3-dimensional trajectory optimization method is proposed for quadrotor tail-sitters. Especially, the differential dynamics constraints are eliminated when generating the trajectory of the tail-sitter by utilizing differential flatness method. Additionally, the temporal parameters of the trajectory are generated using the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method called MINCO (minimum control). Subsequently, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint by discretizing the trajectory in time. This increases the likelihood that the control input limits are satisfied and the trajectory is feasible. Then, we utilize a kind of model predictive control (MPC) method to track trajectories. Even if restricting the tail-sitter's motion to a 2-dimensional horizontal plane, the solutions still outperform those of the L1 Guidance Law and Dubins path.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Safe Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicle Headland Turning in Cluttered Orchard Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10636v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs), including field robots and autonomous tractors, are becoming essential in modern farming by improving efficiency and reducing labor costs. A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows. This task is challenging in orchards with limited headland space, irregular boundaries, operational constraints, and static obstacles. While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization. Applied to vehicles with various implements, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and challenging orchard fields. This work bridges agricultural and autonomous driving technologies, facilitating a broader adoption of AAVs in complex orchards.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

| **[STPOTR: Simultaneous Human Trajectory and Pose Prediction Using a Non-Autoregressive Transformer for Robot Following Ahead](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07600v4)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a neural network model to predict future human motion from an observed human motion history. We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Generation of Near-Minimum-Energy Trajectories via Constraint-Informed Residual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09450v1)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial robotics demands significant energy to operate, making energy-reduction methodologies increasingly important. Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |

The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

The ineffectiveness comes from the conflict between the fact of asymmetric and multi-modal distribution of likely outcomes and symmetric and single-modal original distribution and supervision losses. Instead, we propose constructing a mixed Gaussian prior for a normalizing flow model for trajectory prediction. The prior is constructed by analyzing the trajectory patterns in the training samples without requiring extra annotations while showing better expressiveness and being multi-modal and asymmetric. Besides diversity, it also provides better controllability for probabilistic trajectory generation. We name our method Mixed Gaussian Flow (MGF).

Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

As the backbone of next-generation solutions, these robots face a critical challenge: managing and minimizing the swept volume during turns while maintaining precise control. Traditional systems designed for standard vehicles often struggle with the complex dynamics of multi-axle configurations, leading to inefficiency and increased safety risk in confined spaces. Our innovative framework overcomes these limitations by combining swept volume minimization with Signed Distance Field (SDF) path planning and model predictive control (MPC) for independent wheel steering. This approach not only plans paths with an awareness of the swept volume but actively minimizes it in real-time, allowing each axle to follow a precise trajectory while significantly reducing the space the vehicle occupies. By predicting future states and adjusting the turning radius of each wheel, our method enhances both maneuverability and safety, even in the most constrained environments. Unlike previous works, our solution goes beyond basic path calculation and tracking, offering real-time path optimization with minimal swept volume and efficient individual axle control. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive approach to tackle these challenges, delivering life-saving improvements in control, efficiency, and safety for multi-axle AMRs. Furthermore, we will open-source our work to foster collaboration and enable others to advance safer, more efficient autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted to ICRA 2025</p></details> |
| **[HGTUL: A Hypergraph-based Model For Trajectory User Linking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07549v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory User Linking (TUL), which links anonymous trajectories with users who generate them, plays a crucial role in modeling human mobility. Despite significant advancements in this field, existing studies primarily neglect the high-order inter-trajectory relationships, which represent complex associations among multiple trajectories, manifested through multi-location co-occurrence patterns emerging when trajectories intersect at various Points of Interest (POIs). Furthermore, they also overlook the variable influence of POIs on different trajectories, as well as the user class imbalance problem caused by disparities in user activity levels and check-in frequencies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel HyperGraph-based multi-perspective Trajectory User Linking model (HGTUL). Our model learns trajectory representations from both relational and spatio-temporal perspectives: (1) it captures high-order associations among trajectories by constructing a trajectory hypergraph and leverages a hypergraph attention network to learn the variable impact of POIs on trajectories; (2) it models the spatio-temporal characteristics of trajectories by incorporating their temporal and spatial information into a sequential encoder. Moreover, we design a data balancing method to effectively address the user class imbalance problem and experimentally validate its significance in TUL. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HGTUL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving improvements of 2.57%~20.09% and 5.68%~26.00% in ACC@1 and Macro-F1 metrics, respectively.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[PLMTrajRec: A Scalable and Generalizable Trajectory Recovery Method with Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is crucial for various applications. However, issues such as device malfunctions and network instability often cause sparse trajectories, leading to lost detailed movement information. Recovering the missing points in sparse trajectories to restore the detailed information is thus essential. Despite recent progress, several challenges remain. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data makes it difficult to train a trajectory recovery model from scratch. Second, the varying spatiotemporal correlations in sparse trajectories make it hard to generalize recovery across different sampling intervals. Third, the lack of location information complicates the extraction of road conditions for missing points. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory recovery model called PLMTrajRec. It leverages the scalability of a pre-trained language model (PLM) and can be fine-tuned with only a limited set of dense trajectories. To handle different sampling intervals in sparse trajectories, we first convert each trajectory's sampling interval and movement features into natural language representations, allowing the PLM to recognize its interval. We then introduce a trajectory encoder to unify trajectories of varying intervals into a single interval and capture their spatiotemporal relationships. To obtain road conditions for missing points, we propose an area flow-guided implicit trajectory prompt, which models road conditions by collecting traffic flows in each region. We also introduce a road condition passing mechanism that uses observed points' road conditions to infer those of the missing points. Experiments on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals each demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and generalization ability of PLMTrajRec.</p></details> |  |
| **[Holistic Semantic Representation for Navigational Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02737v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation has garnered significant attention from researchers in the field of spatio-temporal analysis, as it can generate substantial synthesized human mobility trajectories that enhance user privacy and alleviate data scarcity. However, existing trajectory generation methods often focus on improving trajectory generation quality from a singular perspective, lacking a comprehensive semantic understanding across various scales. Consequently, we are inspired to develop a HOlistic SEmantic Representation (HOSER) framework for navigational trajectory generation. Given an origin-and-destination (OD) pair and the starting time point of a latent trajectory, we first propose a Road Network Encoder to expand the receptive field of road- and zone-level semantics. Second, we design a Multi-Granularity Trajectory Encoder to integrate the spatio-temporal semantics of the generated trajectory at both the point and trajectory levels. Finally, we employ a Destination-Oriented Navigator to seamlessly integrate destination-oriented guidance. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that HOSER outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin. Moreover, the model's performance in few-shot learning and zero-shot learning scenarios further verifies the effectiveness of our holistic semantic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Online Aggregation of Trajectory Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07178v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction, the task of forecasting future agent behavior from past data, is central to safe and efficient autonomous driving. A diverse set of methods (e.g., rule-based or learned with different architectures and datasets) have been proposed, yet it is often the case that the performance of these methods is sensitive to the deployment environment (e.g., how well the design rules model the environment, or how accurately the test data match the training data). Building upon the principled theory of online convex optimization but also going beyond convexity and stationarity, we present a lightweight and model-agnostic method to aggregate different trajectory predictors online. We propose treating each individual trajectory predictor as an "expert" and maintaining a probability vector to mix the outputs of different experts. Then, the key technical approach lies in leveraging online data -the true agent behavior to be revealed at the next timestep- to form a convex-or-nonconvex, stationary-or-dynamic loss function whose gradient steers the probability vector towards choosing the best mixture of experts. We instantiate this method to aggregate trajectory predictors trained on different cities in the NUSCENES dataset and show that it performs just as well, if not better than, any singular model, even when deployed on the out-of-distribution LYFT dataset.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Reward-Based Collision-Free Algorithm for Trajectory Planning of Autonomous Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06149v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new mission planning algorithm for autonomous robots that enables the reward-based selection of an optimal waypoint sequence from a predefined set. The algorithm computes a feasible trajectory and corresponding control inputs for a robot to navigate between waypoints while avoiding obstacles, maximizing the total reward, and adhering to constraints on state, input and its derivatives, mission time window, and maximum distance. This also solves a generalized prize-collecting traveling salesman problem. The proposed algorithm employs a new genetic algorithm that evolves solution candidates toward the optimal solution based on a fitness function and crossover. During fitness evaluation, a penalty method enforces constraints, and the differential flatness property with clothoid curves efficiently penalizes infeasible trajectories. The Euler spiral method showed promising results for trajectory parameterization compared to minimum snap and jerk polynomials. Due to the discrete exploration space, crossover is performed using a dynamic time-warping-based method and extended convex combination with projection. A mutation step enhances exploration. Results demonstrate the algorithm's ability to find the optimal waypoint sequence, fulfill constraints, avoid infeasible waypoints, and prioritize high-reward ones. Simulations and experiments with a ground vehicle, quadrotor, and quadruped are presented, complemented by benchmarking and a time-complexity analysis.</p></details> |  |

While many promising methods have been developed using online corpora and captioned photographs, their application to scientific domains, where data encodes highly specialized knowledge, remains in its early stages. We present a self-supervised masked modeling framework for 3D particle trajectory analysis in Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). These detectors produce globally sparse (<1% occupancy) but locally dense point clouds, capturing meter-scale particle trajectories at millimeter resolution. Starting with PointMAE, this work proposes volumetric tokenization to group sparse ionization points into resolution-agnostic patches, as well as an auxiliary energy infilling task to improve trajectory semantics. This approach -- which we call Point-based Liquid Argon Masked Autoencoder (PoLAr-MAE) -- achieves 99.4% track and 97.7% shower classification F-scores, matching that of supervised baselines without any labeled data. While the model learns rich particle trajectory representations, it struggles with sub-token phenomena like overlapping or short-lived particle trajectories. To support further research, we release PILArNet-M -- the largest open LArTPC dataset (1M+ events, 5.2B labeled points) -- to advance SSL in high energy physics (HEP).

| **[Bridging Traffic State and Trajectory for Dynamic Road Network and Trajectory Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06870v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective urban traffic management is vital for sustainable city development, relying on intelligent systems with machine learning tasks such as traffic flow prediction and travel time estimation. Traditional approaches usually focus on static road network and trajectory representation learning, and overlook the dynamic nature of traffic states and trajectories, which is crucial for downstream tasks. To address this gap, we propose TRACK, a novel framework to bridge traffic state and trajectory data for dynamic road network and trajectory representation learning. TRACK leverages graph attention networks (GAT) to encode static and spatial road segment features, and introduces a transformer-based model for trajectory representation learning. By incorporating transition probabilities from trajectory data into GAT attention weights, TRACK captures dynamic spatial features of road segments. Meanwhile, TRACK designs a traffic transformer encoder to capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of road segments from traffic state data. To further enhance dynamic representations, TRACK proposes a co-attentional transformer encoder and a trajectory-traffic state matching task. Extensive experiments on real-life urban traffic datasets demonstrate the superiority of TRACK over state-of-the-art baselines. Case studies confirm TRACK's ability to capture spatial-temporal dynamics effectively.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

In particular, real trajectories in the wildlife domain are scarce as a result of ethical and environmental constraints of the collection process. In this paper, we consider the problem of generating long-horizon trajectories, akin to wildlife migration, based on a small set of real samples. We propose a hierarchical approach to learn the global movement characteristics of the real dataset and recursively refine localized regions. Our solution, WildGraph, discretizes the geographic path into a prototype network of H3 (https://www.uber.com/blog/h3/) regions and leverages a recurrent variational auto-encoder to probabilistically generate paths over the regions, based on occupancy. WildGraph successfully generates realistic months-long trajectories using a sample size as small as 60.

Previous methods on controllable video generation primarily leverage 2D control signals to manipulate object motions and have achieved remarkable synthesis results. However, 2D control signals are inherently limited in expressing the 3D nature of object motions. To overcome this problem, we introduce 3DTrajMaster, a robust controller that regulates multi-entity dynamics in 3D space, given user-desired 6DoF pose (location and rotation) sequences of entities. At the core of our approach is a plug-and-play 3D-motion grounded object injector that fuses multiple input entities with their respective 3D trajectories through a gated self-attention mechanism. In addition, we exploit an injector architecture to preserve the video diffusion prior, which is crucial for generalization ability. To mitigate video quality degradation, we introduce a domain adaptor during training and employ an annealed sampling strategy during inference. To address the lack of suitable training data, we construct a 360-Motion Dataset, which first correlates collected 3D human and animal assets with GPT-generated trajectory and then captures their motion with 12 evenly-surround cameras on diverse 3D UE platforms. Extensive experiments show that 3DTrajMaster sets a new state-of-the-art in both accuracy and generalization for controlling multi-entity 3D motions.

Here, such characterization for the optimal learning trajectories is associated with the solution of an optimal control problem for a weakly-controlled gradient system with small parameters, whose time-evolution is guided by a model training dataset and its perturbed version, while the optimization problem consists of a cost functional that summarizes how to gauge the quality/performance of the estimated model parameters at a certain fixed final time w.r.t. a model validating dataset. Moreover, using a successive Galerkin approximation method, we provide an algorithmic recipe how to construct the corresponding optimal learning trajectories leading to the optimal estimated model parameters for such a class of learning problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 Pag...</summary><p>5 Pages (A further extension of the paper: arXiv:2412.08772)</p></details> |

Despite growing interest, recent approaches often struggle with two major challenges: multi-dancer collisions and single-dancer foot sliding. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff) framework, which leverages non-overlapping trajectories to ensure coherent and aesthetically pleasing dance movements. To mitigate collisions, we introduce a Dance-Trajectory Navigator that generates collision-free trajectories for multiple dancers, utilizing a distance-consistency loss to maintain optimal spacing. Furthermore, to reduce foot sliding, we present a footwork adaptor that adjusts trajectory displacement between frames, supported by a relative forward-kinematic loss to further reinforce the correlation between movements and trajectories. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, this information has not been fully exploited during the inference phase, where the agent needs to generate an optimal policy instead of just reconstructing masked components from unmasked ones. Given that a pretrained trajectory model can act as both a Policy Model and a World Model with appropriate mask patterns, we propose using Model Predictive Control (MPC) at test time to leverage the model's own predictive capability to guide its action selection. Empirical results on D4RL and RoboMimic show that our inference-phase MPC significantly improves the decision-making performance of a pretrained trajectory model without any additional parameter training. Furthermore, our framework can be adapted to Offline to Online (O2O) RL and Goal Reaching RL, resulting in more substantial performance gains when an additional online interaction budget is provided, and better generalization capabilities when different task targets are specified.

| **[Spatiotemporal Trajectory Tracking Method for Vehicles Incorporating Lead-Lag Judgement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03974v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of intelligent transportation systems, especially within the context of autonomous vehicle control, the preemptive holistic collaborative system has been presented as a promising solution to bring a remarkable enhancement in traffic efficiency and a substantial reduction in the accident rate, demonstrating a great potential of development. In order to ensure this system operates as intended, accurate tracking of the spatiotemporal trajectory is of crucial significance. Moreover, minimizing the tracking error is a necessary step in this process. To this end, a novel lead-lag judgment mechanism is proposed. This mechanism precisely quantifies the longitudinal positional deviation between the vehicle and the target trajectory over time, then the deviation is corrected with a real - time acceleration compensation strategy, as a result, the accuracy and reliability of trajectory tracking are significantly enhanced. Real - vehicle experiments were conducted in a dedicated test field to validate the feasibility of this innovative approach empirically. Subsequently, the obtained tracking data was subsequent processed using the lead-lag judgment mechanism. In this step, we carefully analyzed the spatiotemporal error patterns between the vehicle and the target trajectory under different alignments and speeds. Finally, using real highway speed and alignment data, we conducted comprehensive spatiotemporal trajectory tracking simulations. Through experiments and simulations, tracking errors maintained in an acceptable range and reasonable spatiotemporal distance is given during the preemptive merging process on highway ramps. Overall, this study offers valuable insights for highway ramp emerging safety. Future work can expand on these findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reduce Lap Time for Autonomous Racing with Curvature-Integrated MPCC Local Trajectory Planning Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03695v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread application of autonomous driving technology has significantly advanced the field of autonomous racing. Model Predictive Contouring Control (MPCC) is a highly effective local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. However, the traditional MPCC method struggles with racetracks that have significant curvature changes, limiting the performance of the vehicle during autonomous racing. To address this issue, we propose a curvature-integrated MPCC (CiMPCC) local trajectory planning method for autonomous racing. This method optimizes the velocity of the local trajectory based on the curvature of the racetrack centerline. The specific implementation involves mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline to a reference velocity profile, which is then incorporated into the cost function for optimizing the velocity of the local trajectory. This reference velocity profile is created by normalizing and mapping the curvature of the racetrack centerline, thereby ensuring efficient and performance-oriented local trajectory planning in racetracks with significant curvature. The proposed CiMPCC method has been experimented on a self-built 1:10 scale F1TENTH racing vehicle deployed with ROS platform. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves outstanding results on a challenging racetrack with sharp curvature, improving the overall lap time by 11.4%-12.5% compared to other autonomous racing trajectory planning methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/zhouhengli/CiMPCC.</p></details> |  |

Our key insight is to identify guide paths that approximately track the reference trajectory and strategically bias sampling toward the guide paths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework by restructuring two existing graph-based trajectory tracking algorithms and evaluating the updated algorithms in three experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL)</p></details> |
| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Prior works addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure and a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce the PO-MFL algorithm to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees to the partially observed setting. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free baseline in key scenarios.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, applying these models requires inferring their specifications from observed behaviors -- a challenging task known as the inverse game problem. Existing inverse game approaches often struggle to account for behavioral uncertainty and measurement noise, and leverage both offline and online data. To address these limitations, we propose an inverse game method that integrates a generative trajectory model into a differentiable mixed-strategy game framework. By representing the mixed strategy with a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), our method can infer high-dimensional, multi-modal behavior distributions from noisy measurements while adapting in real-time to new observations. We extensively evaluate our method in a simulated navigation benchmark, where the observations are generated by an unknown game model. Despite the model mismatch, our method can infer Nash-optimal actions comparable to those of the ground-truth model and the oracle inverse game baseline, even in the presence of uncertain agent objectives and noisy measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICRA 2025. 8 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

We provide non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for matrices $A,C$, the Kalman filter gain $K$, and the closed loop matrix $A-KC $, based on multiple sample trajectories, and further give the first non-asymptotic high-probability upper bounds for the system poles, which cover both (marginally) stable systems and unstable systems. We show that, with high probability, the non-asymptotic estimation errors of these matrices decay at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(\sqrt{1/N}) $, while the estimation error of the system poles decays at a rate of at least $ \mathcal{O}(N^{-\frac{1}{2n}}) $, where $ N $ represents the number of sample trajectories. Furthermore, we prove that SIMs become ill-conditioned when the ratio $n/m$ is large, regardless of the system parameters. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the non-asymptotic results and the ill-conditionedness of SIM.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

However, efficiently training video diffusion models capable of integrating directional guidance and controllable motion intensity remains a challenging and under-explored area. To tackle these challenges, this paper introduces Mojito, a diffusion model that incorporates both motion trajectory and intensity control for text-to-video generation. Specifically, Mojito features a Directional Motion Control (DMC) module that leverages cross-attention to efficiently direct the generated object's motion without training, alongside a Motion Intensity Modulator (MIM) that uses optical flow maps generated from videos to guide varying levels of motion intensity. Extensive experiments demonstrate Mojito's effectiveness in achieving precise trajectory and intensity control with high computational efficiency, generating motion patterns that closely match specified directions and intensities, providing realistic dynamics that align well with natural motion in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |

Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |

Spatial-temporal (ST) methods often separately model spatial interactions among pedestrians and temporal dependencies of individuals. They overlook the direct impacts of interactions among different pedestrians across various time steps (i.e., high-order cross-time interactions). This limits their ability to capture ST inter-dependencies and hinders prediction performance. To address these limitations, we propose UniEdge with three major designs. Firstly, we introduce a unified ST graph data structure that simplifies high-order cross-time interactions into first-order relationships, enabling the learning of ST inter-dependencies in a single step. This avoids the information loss caused by multi-step aggregation. Secondly, traditional GNNs focus on aggregating pedestrian node features, neglecting the propagation of implicit interaction patterns encoded in edge features. We propose the Edge-to-Edge-Node-to-Node Graph Convolution (E2E-N2N-GCN), a novel dual-graph network that jointly models explicit N2N social interactions among pedestrians and implicit E2E influence propagation across these interaction patterns. Finally, to overcome the limited receptive fields and challenges in capturing long-range dependencies of auto-regressive architectures, we introduce a transformer encoder-based predictor that enables global modeling of temporal correlation. UniEdge outperforms state-of-the-arts on multiple datasets, including ETH, UCY, and SDD.</p></details> |  |

Remote assistance concepts, where operators provide discrete inputs to aid specific automation modules like planning, is gaining interest due to its reduced workload on the human remote operator and improved safety. However, these concepts are challenging to implement and maintain due to their deep integration and interaction with the automated driving system. In this paper, we propose a solution to facilitate the implementation of remote assistance concepts that intervene on planning level and extend the operational design domain of the vehicle at runtime. Using arbitration graphs, a modular decision-making framework, we integrate remote assistance into an existing automated driving system without modifying the original software components. Our simulative implementation demonstrates this approach in two use cases, allowing operators to adjust planner constraints and enable trajectory generation beyond nominal operational design domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 8 figures, handed in for possible publication at IEEE IV 2025, video demonstration available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVSO-YOeGMk</p></details> |

One-step diffusion models generate high-quality images in a one sampling step, greatly reducing computational overhead and inference latency. However, most existing one-step diffusion methods are constrained by the performance of the teacher model, where poor teacher performance results in image artifacts. To address this limitation, we propose FluxSR, a novel one-step diffusion Real-ISR technique based on flow matching models. We use the state-of-the-art diffusion model FLUX.1-dev as both the teacher model and the base model. First, we introduce Flow Trajectory Distillation (FTD) to distill a multi-step flow matching model into a one-step Real-ISR. Second, to improve image realism and address high-frequency artifact issues in generated images, we propose TV-LPIPS as a perceptual loss and introduce Attention Diversification Loss (ADL) as a regularization term to reduce token similarity in transformer, thereby eliminating high-frequency artifacts. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing one-step diffusion-based Real-ISR methods.

This enables efficient training and produces models with performance close to those trained on the original sets. Most existing dataset condensation methods conduct dataset learning under the bilevel (inner- and outer-loop) based optimization. However, the preceding methods perform with limited dataset generalization due to the notoriously complicated loss landscape and expensive time-space complexity of the inner-loop unrolling of bilevel optimization. These issues deteriorate when the datasets are learned via matching the trajectories of networks trained on the real and synthetic datasets with a long horizon inner-loop. To address these issues, we introduce Sharpness-Aware Trajectory Matching (SATM), which enhances the generalization capability of learned synthetic datasets by optimising the sharpness of the loss landscape and objective simultaneously. Moreover, our approach is coupled with an efficient hypergradient approximation that is mathematically well-supported and straightforward to implement along with controllable computational overhead. Empirical evaluations of SATM demonstrate its effectiveness across various applications, including in-domain benchmarks and out-of-domain settings. Moreover, its easy-to-implement properties afford flexibility, allowing it to integrate with other advanced sharpness-aware minimizers. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

| **[Resilient UAV Trajectory Planning via Few-Shot Meta-Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01268v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has been a promising essence in future 5G-beyond and 6G systems. Its main advantage lies in its robust model-free decision-making in complex and large-dimension wireless environments. However, most existing RL frameworks rely on online interaction with the environment, which might not be feasible due to safety and cost concerns. Another problem with online RL is the lack of scalability of the designed algorithm with dynamic or new environments. This work proposes a novel, resilient, few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm combining offline RL using conservative Q-learning (CQL) and meta-learning using model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML). The proposed algorithm can train RL models using static offline datasets without any online interaction with the environments. In addition, with the aid of MAML, the proposed model can be scaled up to new unseen environments. We showcase the proposed algorithm for optimizing an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) 's trajectory and scheduling policy to minimize the age-of-information (AoI) and transmission power of limited-power devices. Numerical results show that the proposed few-shot meta-offline RL algorithm converges faster than baseline schemes, such as deep Q-networks and CQL. In addition, it is the only algorithm that can achieve optimal joint AoI and transmission power using an offline dataset with few shots of data points and is resilient to network failures due to unprecedented environmental changes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions suffer from limited cross-task transferability. In addition, they only utilize optimal weights as training samples, ignoring the value of other weights in the optimization process. To address these issues, we propose Lt-Di, which integrates the diffusion algorithm with meta-learning to generate weights for unseen tasks. Furthermore, we extend the vanilla diffusion algorithm into a trajectory diffusion algorithm to utilize other weights along the optimization trajectory. Trajectory diffusion decomposes the entire diffusion chain into multiple shorter ones, improving training and inference efficiency. We analyze the convergence properties of the weight generation paradigm and improve convergence efficiency without additional time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate Lt-Di's higher accuracy while reducing computational overhead across various tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot learning, multi-domain generalization, and large-scale language model fine-tuning.Our code is released at https://github.com/tuantuange/Lt-Di.</p></details> |  |

However, collecting large-scale trajectory datasets is challenging due to factors such as commercial conflicts and privacy regulations. Therefore, we urgently need trajectory generation techniques to address this issue. Existing trajectory generation methods rely on the global road network structure of cities. When the road network structure changes, these methods are often not transferable to other cities. In fact, there exist invariant mobility patterns between different cities: 1) People prefer paths with the minimal travel cost; 2) The travel cost of roads has an invariant relationship with the topological features of the road network. Based on the above insight, this paper proposes a Generalizable Trajectory Generation model (GTG). The model consists of three parts: 1) Extracting city-invariant road representation based on Space Syntax method; 2) Cross-city travel cost prediction through disentangled adversarial training; 3) Travel preference learning by shortest path search and preference update. By learning invariant movement patterns, the model is capable of generating trajectories in new cities. Experiments on three datasets demonstrates that our model significantly outperforms existing models in terms of generalization ability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

However, it is challenging to obtain sufficiently accurate representations of the environmental dynamics due to uncertainties in complex systems and environments. An inaccurate environment model may degrade the sample efficiency and performance of model-based RL. Furthermore, while model-based RL can improve sample efficiency, it often still requires substantial training time to learn from scratch, potentially limiting its advantages over model-free approaches. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a knowledge-informed model-based residual reinforcement learning framework aimed at enhancing learning efficiency by infusing established expert knowledge into the learning process and avoiding the issue of beginning from zero. Our approach integrates traffic expert knowledge into a virtual environment model, employing the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) for basic dynamics and neural networks for residual dynamics, thus ensuring adaptability to complex scenarios. We propose a novel strategy that combines traditional control methods with residual RL, facilitating efficient learning and policy optimization without the need to learn from scratch. The proposed approach is applied to CAV trajectory control tasks for the dissipation of stop-and-go waves in mixed traffic flow.

We present a real-time communication-free distributed algorithm for navigating robots to their desired goals certified by control barrier functions, that model and control the onboard sensing behavior to keep neighbors in the limited field of view for position estimation. The approach is robust to temporary tracking loss and directly synthesizes control in real time to stabilize visual contact through control Lyapunov-barrier functions. The main contributions of this paper are a continuous-time robust trajectory generation and control method certified by control barrier functions for distributed multi-robot systems and a discrete optimization procedure, namely, MPC-CBF, to approximate the certified controller. In addition, we propose a linear surrogate of high-order control barrier function constraints and use sequential quadratic programming to solve MPC-CBF efficiently. We demonstrate results in simulation with 10 robots and physical experiments with 2 custom-built UAVs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first of its kind to generate a robust continuous-time trajectory and controller concurrently, certified by control barrier functions utilizing piecewise splines.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, submitted to RSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Offline Reinforcement Learning with Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00601v1)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) relies on the availability and quality of training data, often requiring extensive interactions with specific environments. In many real-world scenarios, where data collection is costly and risky, offline reinforcement learning (RL) offers a solution by utilizing data collected by domain experts and searching for a batch-constrained optimal policy. This approach is further augmented by incorporating external data sources, expanding the range and diversity of data collection possibilities. However, existing offline RL methods often struggle with challenges posed by non-matching data from these external sources. In this work, we specifically address the problem of source-target domain mismatch in scenarios involving mixed datasets, characterized by a predominance of source data generated from random or suboptimal policies and a limited amount of target data generated from higher-quality policies. To tackle this problem, we introduce Transition Scoring (TS), a novel method that assigns scores to transitions based on their similarity to the target domain, and propose Curriculum Learning-Based Trajectory Valuation (CLTV), which effectively leverages these transition scores to identify and prioritize high-quality trajectories through a curriculum learning approach. Our extensive experiments across various offline RL methods and MuJoCo environments, complemented by rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrate that CLTV enhances the overall performance and transferability of policies learned by offline RL algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAMAS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we present a fast and efficient real-time trajectory planning and control approach for fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles, leveraging the differential flatness property of fixed-wing aircraft in coordinated flight conditions to generate dynamically feasible trajectories. The approach provides the ability to continuously replan trajectories, which we show is useful to dynamically account for the curvature constraint as the aircraft advances along its path. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments validate our approach, showcasing its effectiveness in generating trajectories even in challenging conditions for small FW such as wind disturbances.</p></details> | Approved at Icra 25 |

Existing cross-domain policy transfer methods mostly aim at learning domain correspondences or corrections to facilitate policy learning, such as learning task/domain-specific discriminators, representations, or policies. This design philosophy often results in heavy model architectures or task/domain-specific modeling, lacking flexibility. This reality makes us wonder: can we directly bridge the domain gaps universally at the data level, instead of relying on complex downstream cross-domain policy transfer procedures? In this study, we propose the Cross-Domain Trajectory EDiting (xTED) framework that employs a specially designed diffusion model for cross-domain trajectory adaptation. Our proposed model architecture effectively captures the intricate dependencies among states, actions, and rewards, as well as the dynamics patterns within target data. Edited by adding noises and denoising with the pre-trained diffusion model, source domain trajectories can be transformed to align with target domain properties while preserving original semantic information. This process effectively corrects underlying domain gaps, enhancing state realism and dynamics reliability in source data, and allowing flexible integration with various single-domain and cross-domain downstream policy learning methods. Despite its simplicity, xTED demonstrates superior performance in extensive simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>xTED ...</summary><p>xTED offers a novel, generic, flexible, simple and effective paradigm that casts cross-domain policy adaptation as a data pre-processing problem</p></details> |
| **[K Nearest Neighbor-Guided Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00285v1)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity is fundamental to many spatio-temporal data mining applications. Recent studies propose deep learning models to approximate conventional trajectory similarity measures, exploiting their fast inference time once trained. Although efficient inference has been reported, challenges remain in similarity approximation accuracy due to difficulties in trajectory granularity modeling and in exploiting similarity signals in the training data. To fill this gap, we propose TSMini, a highly effective trajectory similarity model with a sub-view modeling mechanism capable of learning multi-granularity trajectory patterns and a k nearest neighbor-based loss that guides TSMini to learn not only absolute similarity values between trajectories but also their relative similarity ranks. Together, these two innovations enable highly accurate trajectory similarity approximation. Experiments show that TSMini can outperform the state-of-the-art models by 22% in accuracy on average when learning trajectory similarity measures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization Under Stochastic Dynamics Leveraging Maximum Mean Discrepancy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19045v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses sampling-based trajectory optimization for risk-aware navigation under stochastic dynamics. Typically such approaches operate by computing $\tilde{N}$ perturbed rollouts around the nominal dynamics to estimate the collision risk associated with a sequence of control commands. We consider a setting where it is expensive to estimate risk using perturbed rollouts, for example, due to expensive collision-checks. We put forward two key contributions. First, we develop an algorithm that distills the statistical information from a larger set of rollouts to a reduced-set with sample size $N<<\tilde{N}$. Consequently, we estimate collision risk using just $N$ rollouts instead of $\tilde{N}$. Second, we formulate a novel surrogate for the collision risk that can leverage the distilled statistical information contained in the reduced-set. We formalize both algorithmic contributions using distribution embedding in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). We perform extensive benchmarking to demonstrate that our MMD-based approach leads to safer trajectories at low sample regime than existing baselines using Conditional Value-at Risk (CVaR) based collision risk estimate.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/Basant1861/MPC-MMD</p></details> |
| **[Best Policy Learning from Trajectory Preference Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18873v1)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of best policy identification in preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL), where learning occurs from noisy binary preferences over trajectory pairs rather than explicit numerical rewards. This approach is useful for post-training optimization of generative AI models during multi-turn user interactions, where preference feedback is more robust than handcrafted reward models. In this setting, learning is driven by both an offline preference dataset -- collected from a rater of unknown 'competence' -- and online data collected with pure exploration. Since offline datasets may exhibit out-of-distribution (OOD) biases, principled online data collection is necessary. To address this, we propose Posterior Sampling for Preference Learning ($\mathsf{PSPL}$), a novel algorithm inspired by Top-Two Thompson Sampling, that maintains independent posteriors over the true reward model and transition dynamics. We provide the first theoretical guarantees for PbRL in this setting, establishing an upper bound on the simple Bayesian regret of $\mathsf{PSPL}$. Since the exact algorithm can be computationally impractical, we also provide an approximate version that outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Optimization Trajectories Explain Multi-Task Transfer?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14677v2)** | 2025-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the widespread adoption of multi-task training in deep learning, little is understood about how multi-task learning (MTL) affects generalization. Prior work has conjectured that the negative effects of MTL are due to optimization challenges that arise during training, and many optimization methods have been proposed to improve multi-task performance. However, recent work has shown that these methods fail to consistently improve multi-task generalization. In this work, we seek to improve our understanding of these failures by empirically studying how MTL impacts the optimization of tasks, and whether this impact can explain the effects of MTL on generalization. We show that MTL results in a generalization gap (a gap in generalization at comparable training loss) between single-task and multi-task trajectories early into training. However, we find that factors of the optimization trajectory previously proposed to explain generalization gaps in single-task settings cannot explain the generalization gaps between single-task and multi-task models. Moreover, we show that the amount of gradient conflict between tasks is correlated with negative effects to task optimization, but is not predictive of generalization. Our work sheds light on the underlying causes for failures in MTL and, importantly, raises questions about the role of general purpose multi-task optimization algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages; Published in TMLR</p></details> |

During the flight phases, where the ground reaction forces are not available for regulation, the limb swinging trajectories are significant for the stability of the next stance phase. Due to the conservation of angular momentum, improper leg and arm swinging results in highly tilted and unsustainable body configurations at the next stance phase landing. In such cases, the robotic system fails to maintain locomotion independent of the stability of the center of mass trajectories. This problem is more apparent for fast and high flight time trajectories. This paper proposes a real-time nonlinear limb trajectory optimization problem for humanoid running. The optimization problem is tested on two different humanoid robot models, and the generated trajectories are verified using a running algorithm for both robots in a simulation environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), Atlanta 2025. v2: - A Github link to the proposed optimization tool is added. - There are no changes in the method and results</p></details> |

However, the current limiter in the control loops of the GFM IBR poses challenges to the effectiveness of power swing detection functions designed for SG-based systems. Among various current limiting strategies, current saturation algorithms (CSAs), widely employed for their strict current limiting capability, are the focus of this paper. The paper presents a theoretical analysis of the conditions for entering and exiting the current saturation mode of the GFM IBR under three CSAs. Furthermore, the corresponding impedance trajectories observed by the distance relay on the GFM IBR side are investigated. The analysis results reveal that the unique impedance trajectories under these CSAs markedly differ from those associated with SGs. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the conventional power swing detection scheme may lose functionality due to the rapid movement of the trajectory or its failure to pass through the detection zones. Conclusions are validated through simulations in MATLAB/Simulink.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional grasping tasks where the object's geometry is assumed simple, we aim to achieve a "dynamic grasp" of the irregular objects, which requires continuous adjustment during the grasping process. To effectively handle irregular objects, we propose a trajectory optimization framework that comprises two phases. Firstly, in a specified time limit of 10s, initial offline trajectories are computed for a seamless motion from an initial configuration of the robot to grasp the object and deliver it to a pre-defined target location. Secondly, fast online trajectory optimization is implemented to update robot trajectories in real-time within 100 ms. This helps to mitigate pose estimation errors from the vision system. To account for model inaccuracies, disturbances, and other non-modeled effects, trajectory tracking controllers for both the robot and the gripper are implemented to execute the optimal trajectories from the proposed framework. The intensive experimental results effectively demonstrate the performance of our trajectory planning framework in both simulation and real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages.

Unlike GPS trackers which emit satellite signals from the animal's location, acoustic receivers are akin to stationary motion sensors that record movements within their detection range. Thus, for periods of time, fish may be far from the receivers, resulting in the absence of observations. The lack of information on the fish's location for extended time periods poses challenges to the understanding of fish movement patterns, and hence, the identification of proper statistical inference frameworks for modeling the trajectories. As the initial step in our methodology, in this paper, we devise and implement a simulation-based imputation strategy that relies on both Markov chain and random-walk principles to enhance our dataset over time. This methodology will be generalizable and applicable to all fish species with similar migration patterns or data with similar structures due to the use of static acoustic receivers.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning methods have shown significant promise, the application of large language models (LLMs) to this domain remains underexplored. This study pioneers the use of LLMs for flight trajectory prediction by reframing it as a language modeling problem. Specifically, We extract features representing the aircraft's position and status from ADS-B flight data to construct a prompt-based dataset, where trajectory waypoints are converted into language tokens. The dataset is then employed to fine-tune LLMs, enabling them to learn complex spatiotemporal patterns for accurate predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that LLMs achieve notable performance improvements in both single-step and multi-step predictions compared to traditional methods, with LLaMA-3.1 model achieving the highest overall accuracy. However, the high inference latency of LLMs poses a challenge for real-time applications, underscoring the need for further research in this promising direction.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Target-driven Self-Distillation for Partial Observed Trajectories Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16767v1)** | 2025-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of future trajectories of traffic agents is essential for ensuring safe autonomous driving. However, partially observed trajectories can significantly degrade the performance of even state-of-the-art models. Previous approaches often rely on knowledge distillation to transfer features from fully observed trajectories to partially observed ones. This involves firstly training a fully observed model and then using a distillation process to create the final model. While effective, they require multi-stage training, making the training process very expensive. Moreover, knowledge distillation can lead to a performance degradation of the model. In this paper, we introduce a Target-driven Self-Distillation method (TSD) for motion forecasting. Our method leverages predicted accurate targets to guide the model in making predictions under partial observation conditions. By employing self-distillation, the model learns from the feature distributions of both fully observed and partially observed trajectories during a single end-to-end training process. This enhances the model's ability to predict motion accurately in both fully observed and partially observed scenarios. We evaluate our method on multiple datasets and state-of-the-art motion forecasting models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves significant performance improvements in both settings. To facilitate further research, we will release our code and model checkpoints.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes a framework to assess the feasibility of UAM route integration using probabilistic aircraft trajectory prediction. By leveraging conditional Normalizing Flows, the framework predicts short-term trajectory distributions of conventional aircraft, enabling UAM vehicles to dynamically adjust speeds and maintain safe separations. The methodology was applied to airspace over Seoul metropolitan area, encompassing interactions between UAM and conventional traffic at multiple altitudes and lanes. The results reveal that different physical locations of lanes and routes experience varying interaction patterns and encounter dynamics. For instance, Lane 1 at lower altitudes (1,500 ft and 2,000 ft) exhibited minimal interactions with conventional aircraft, resulting in the largest separations and the most stable delay proportions. In contrast, Lane 4 near the airport experienced more frequent and complex interactions due to its proximity to departing traffic. The limited trajectory data for departing aircraft in this region occasionally led to tighter separations and increased operational challenges. This study underscores the potential of predictive modeling in facilitating UAM integration while highlighting critical trade-offs between safety and efficiency. The findings contribute to refining airspace management strategies and offer insights for scaling UAM operations in complex urban environments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 7 figures |

We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability.

However, the development and ranking of state-of-the-art (SotA) models are driven by their In-Distribution (ID) performance on individual competition datasets. We present an OoD testing protocol that homogenizes datasets and prediction tasks across two large-scale motion datasets. We introduce a novel prediction algorithm based on polynomial representations for agent trajectory and road geometry on both the input and output sides of the model. With a much smaller model size, training effort, and inference time, we reach near SotA performance for ID testing and significantly improve robustness in OoD testing. Within our OoD testing protocol, we further study two augmentation strategies of SotA models and their effects on model generalization. Highlighting the contrast between ID and OoD performance, we suggest adding OoD testing to the evaluation criteria of trajectory prediction models.</p></details> |  |

This capability hinges on solving non-convex optimal control problems in real-time, although traditional iterative methods such as sequential convex programming impose significant computational challenges. To mitigate this burden, the Autonomous Rendezvous Transformer (ART) introduced a generative model trained to provide near-optimal initial guesses. This approach provides convergence to better local optima (e.g., fuel optimality), improves feasibility rates, and results in faster convergence speed of optimization algorithms through warm-starting. This work extends the capabilities of ART to address robust chance-constrained optimal control problems. Specifically, ART is applied to challenging rendezvous scenarios in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), ensuring fault-tolerant behavior under uncertainty. Through extensive experimentation, the proposed warm-starting strategy is shown to consistently produce high-quality reference trajectories, achieving up to 30\% cost improvement and 50\% reduction in infeasible cases compared to conventional methods, demonstrating robust performance across multiple state representations. Additionally, a post hoc evaluation framework is proposed to assess the quality of generated trajectories and mitigate runtime failures, marking an initial step toward the reliable deployment of AI-driven solutions in safety-critical autonomous systems such as spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the IEEE Aerospace Conference 2025. 13 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |

While numerous studies have focused on modeling interactions among pedestrians to forecast their movements, the influence of environmental factors and scene-object placements has been comparatively underexplored. In this paper, we present a novel trajectory prediction model that integrates both pedestrian interactions and environmental context to improve prediction accuracy. Our approach captures spatial and temporal interactions among pedestrians within a sparse graph framework. To account for pedestrian-scene interactions, we employ advanced image enhancement and semantic segmentation techniques to extract detailed scene features. These scene and interaction features are then fused through a cross-attention mechanism, enabling the model to prioritize relevant environmental factors that influence pedestrian movements. Finally, a temporal convolutional network processes the fused features to predict future pedestrian trajectories. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving ADE and FDE values of 0.252 and 0.372 meters, respectively, underscoring the importance of incorporating both social interactions and environmental context in pedestrian trajectory prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 International Conference on Intelligent Computing and its Emerging Applications</p></details> |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Due to the complexity of intersection scenarios and the limitations of single-vehicle perception, the performance of vehicle-centric prediction methods has reached a plateau. Furthermore, most works underutilize critical intersection information, including traffic signals, and behavior patterns induced by road structures. Therefore, we propose a multi-agent trajectory prediction framework at signalized intersections dedicated to Infrastructure-to-Everything (I2XTraj). Our framework leverages dynamic graph attention to integrate knowledge from traffic signals and driving behaviors. A continuous signal-informed mechanism is proposed to adaptively process real-time traffic signals from infrastructure devices. Additionally, leveraging the prior knowledge of the intersection topology, we propose a driving strategy awareness mechanism to model the joint distribution of goal intentions and maneuvers. To the best of our knowledge, I2XTraj represents the first multi-agent trajectory prediction framework explicitly designed for infrastructure deployment, supplying subscribable prediction services to all vehicles at intersections. I2XTraj demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on both the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure dataset V2X-Seq and the aerial-view dataset SinD for signalized intersections. Quantitative evaluations show that our approach outperforms existing methods by more than 30% in both multi-agent and single-agent scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-Shot Trajectory Planning for Signal Temporal Logic Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13457v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a powerful specification language for describing complex temporal behaviors of continuous signals, making it well-suited for high-level robotic task descriptions. However, generating executable plans for STL tasks is challenging, as it requires consideration of the coupling between the task specification and the system dynamics. Existing approaches either follow a model-based setting that explicitly requires knowledge of the system dynamics or adopt a task-oriented data-driven approach to learn plans for specific tasks. In this work, we investigate the problem of generating executable STL plans for systems whose dynamics are unknown a priori. We propose a new planning framework that uses only task-agnostic data during the offline training stage, enabling zero-shot generalization to new STL tasks. Our framework is hierarchical, involving: (i) decomposing the STL task into a set of progress and time constraints, (ii) searching for time-aware waypoints guided by task-agnostic data, and (iii) generating trajectories using a pre-trained safe diffusion model. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method indeed in achieving zero-shot generalization to various STL tasks.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[One Fits All: General Mobility Trajectory Modeling via Masked Conditional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13347v1)** | 2025-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory data play a crucial role in many applications, ranging from network optimization to urban planning. Existing studies on trajectory data are task-specific, and their applicability is limited to the specific tasks on which they have been trained, such as generation, recovery, or prediction. However, the potential of a unified model has not yet been fully explored in trajectory modeling. Although various trajectory tasks differ in inputs, outputs, objectives, and conditions, they share common mobility patterns. Based on these common patterns, we can construct a general framework that enables a single model to address different tasks. However, building a trajectory task-general framework faces two critical challenges: 1) the diversity in the formats of different tasks and 2) the complexity of the conditions imposed on different tasks. In this work, we propose a general trajectory modeling framework via masked conditional diffusion (named GenMove). Specifically, we utilize mask conditions to unify diverse formats. To adapt to complex conditions associated with different tasks, we utilize historical trajectory data to obtain contextual trajectory embeddings, which include rich contexts such as spatiotemporal characteristics and user preferences. Integrating the contextual trajectory embedding into diffusion models through a classifier-free guidance approach allows the model to flexibly adjust its outputs based on different conditions. Extensive experiments on mainstream tasks demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with the highest performance improvement exceeding 13% in generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-temporal Graph Network Allowing Incomplete Trajectory Input for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13973v1)** | 2025-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is important in the research of mobile robot navigation in environments with pedestrians. Most pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms require the input historical trajectories to be complete. If a pedestrian is unobservable in any frame in the past, then its historical trajectory become incomplete, the algorithm will not predict its future trajectory. To address this limitation, we propose the STGN-IT, a spatio-temporal graph network allowing incomplete trajectory input, which can predict the future trajectories of pedestrians with incomplete historical trajectories. STGN-IT uses the spatio-temporal graph with an additional encoding method to represent the historical trajectories and observation states of pedestrians. Moreover, STGN-IT introduces static obstacles in the environment that may affect the future trajectories as nodes to further improve the prediction accuracy. A clustering algorithm is also applied in the construction of spatio-temporal graphs. Experiments on public datasets show that STGN-IT outperforms state of the art algorithms on these metrics.</p></details> |  |

We apply state feedback linearisation control for the process and propose a simplified implementation of the model control loop which results in a simple model in Brunovsky-form that represents the nominal feedback linearised dynamics of the nonlinear process. To compensate possibly unmatched model uncertainties, we employ Lyapunov redesign with numeric derivatives of the output. It turns out that for a special initialisation of the model, the MFC reduces to a single-loop control design. We illustrate our results by a numerical example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning segmentation from point trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12392v1)** | 2025-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of segmenting objects in videos based on their motion and no other forms of supervision. Prior work has often approached this problem by using the principle of common fate, namely the fact that the motion of points that belong to the same object is strongly correlated. However, most authors have only considered instantaneous motion from optical flow. In this work, we present a way to train a segmentation network using long-term point trajectories as a supervisory signal to complement optical flow. The key difficulty is that long-term motion, unlike instantaneous motion, is difficult to model -- any parametric approximation is unlikely to capture complex motion patterns over long periods of time. We instead draw inspiration from subspace clustering approaches, proposing a loss function that seeks to group the trajectories into low-rank matrices where the motion of object points can be approximately explained as a linear combination of other point tracks. Our method outperforms the prior art on motion-based segmentation, which shows the utility of long-term motion and the effectiveness of our formulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight.

| **[Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414v1)** | 2025-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Applications of Evolutionary Computation 28th International Conference, EvoApplications 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-temporal characterisation of underwater noise through semantic trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11131v1)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater noise pollution from human activities, particularly shipping, has been recognised as a serious threat to marine life. The sound generated by vessels can have various adverse effects on fish and aquatic ecosystems in general. In this setting, the estimation and analysis of the underwater noise produced by vessels is an important challenge for the preservation of the marine environment. In this paper we propose a model for the spatio-temporal characterisation of the underwater noise generated by vessels. The approach is based on the reconstruction of the vessels' trajectories from Automatic Identification System (AIS) data and on their deployment in a spatio-temporal database. Trajectories are enriched with semantic information like the acoustic characteristics of the vessels' engines or the activity performed by the vessels. We define a model for underwater noise propagation and use the trajectories' information to infer how noise propagates in the area of interest. We develop our approach for the case study of the fishery activities in the Northern Adriatic sea, an area of the Mediterranean sea which is well known to be highly exploited. We implement our approach using MobilityDB, an open source geospatial trajectory data management and analysis platform, which offers spatio-temporal operators and indexes improving the efficiency of our system. We use this platform to conduct various analyses of the underwater noise generated in the Northern Adriatic Sea, aiming at estimating the impact of fishing activities on underwater noise pollution and at demonstrating the flexibility and expressiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

To further enhance temporal features, we introduce a Temporal Feature Enhancement Module, which integrates spectral features into temporal data using residual cross-attention. This enhanced temporal information is then employed for precise 3D trajectory estimation and classification.

| **[Audio Array-Based 3D UAV Trajectory Estimation with LiDAR Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12698v5)** | 2025-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) become increasingly prevalent, there is growing concern regarding their impact on public safety and privacy, highlighting the need for advanced tracking and trajectory estimation solutions. In response, this paper introduces a novel framework that utilizes audio array for 3D UAV trajectory estimation. Our approach incorporates a self-supervised learning model, starting with the conversion of audio data into mel-spectrograms, which are analyzed through an encoder to extract crucial temporal and spectral information. Simultaneously, UAV trajectories are estimated using LiDAR point clouds via unsupervised methods. These LiDAR-based estimations act as pseudo labels, enabling the training of an Audio Perception Network without requiring labeled data. In this architecture, the LiDAR-based system operates as the Teacher Network, guiding the Audio Perception Network, which serves as the Student Network. Once trained, the model can independently predict 3D trajectories using only audio signals, with no need for LiDAR data or external ground truth during deployment. To further enhance precision, we apply Gaussian Process modeling for improved spatiotemporal tracking. Our method delivers top-tier performance on the MMAUD dataset, establishing a new benchmark in trajectory estimation using self-supervised learning techniques without reliance on ground truth annotations.</p></details> | Accepted for ICASSP |
| **[Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer for Long-Tail Trajectory Prediction in the Crash Scenario](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16349v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction methods have been widely applied in autonomous driving technologies. Although the overall performance accuracy of trajectory prediction is relatively high, the lack of trajectory data in critical scenarios in the training data leads to the long-tail phenomenon. Normally, the trajectories of the tail data are more critical and more difficult to predict and may include rare scenarios such as crashes. To solve this problem, we extracted the trajectory data from real-world crash scenarios, which contain more long-tail data. Meanwhile, based on the trajectory data in this scenario, we integrated graph-based risk information and diffusion with transformer and proposed the Risk-Informed Diffusion Transformer (RI-DiT) trajectory prediction method. Extensive experiments were conducted on trajectory data in the real-world crash scenario, and the results show that the algorithm we proposed has good performance. When predicting the data of the tail 10\% (Top 10\%), the minADE and minFDE indicators are 0.016/2.667 m. At the same time, we showed the trajectory conditions of different long-tail distributions. The distribution of trajectory data is closer to the tail, the less smooth the trajectory is. Through the trajectory data in real-world crash scenarios, Our work expands the methods to overcome the long-tail challenges in trajectory prediction. Our method, RI-DiT, integrates inverse time to collision (ITTC) and the feature of traffic flow, which can predict long-tail trajectories more accurately and improve the safety of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Three-dimensional Trajectory Optimization for Quadrotor Tail-sitter UAVs: Traversing through Given Waypoints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08347v3)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given the evolving application scenarios of current fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), it is necessary for UAVs to possess agile and rapid 3-dimensional flight capabilities. Typically, the trajectory of a tail-sitter is generated separately for vertical and level flights. This limits the tail-sitter's ability to move in a 3-dimensional airspace and makes it difficult to establish a smooth transition between vertical and level flights. In the present work, a 3-dimensional trajectory optimization method is proposed for quadrotor tail-sitters. Especially, the differential dynamics constraints are eliminated when generating the trajectory of the tail-sitter by utilizing differential flatness method. Additionally, the temporal parameters of the trajectory are generated using the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method called MINCO (minimum control). Subsequently, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint by discretizing the trajectory in time. This increases the likelihood that the control input limits are satisfied and the trajectory is feasible. Then, we utilize a kind of model predictive control (MPC) method to track trajectories. Even if restricting the tail-sitter's motion to a 2-dimensional horizontal plane, the solutions still outperform those of the L1 Guidance Law and Dubins path.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient and Safe Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Agricultural Vehicle Headland Turning in Cluttered Orchard Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10636v1)** | 2025-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agricultural vehicles (AAVs), including field robots and autonomous tractors, are becoming essential in modern farming by improving efficiency and reducing labor costs. A critical task in AAV operations is headland turning between crop rows. This task is challenging in orchards with limited headland space, irregular boundaries, operational constraints, and static obstacles. While traditional trajectory planning methods work well in arable farming, they often fail in cluttered orchard environments. This letter presents a novel trajectory planner that enhances the safety and efficiency of AAV headland maneuvers, leveraging advancements in autonomous driving. Our approach includes an efficient front-end algorithm and a high-performance back-end optimization. Applied to vehicles with various implements, it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both standard and challenging orchard fields. This work bridges agricultural and autonomous driving technologies, facilitating a broader adoption of AAVs in complex orchards.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Learning Informative Trajectory Embeddings for Imitation, Classification and Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09327v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world sequential decision making tasks like autonomous driving, robotics, and healthcare, learning from observed state-action trajectories is critical for tasks like imitation, classification, and clustering. For example, self-driving cars must replicate human driving behaviors, while robots and healthcare systems benefit from modeling decision sequences, whether or not they come from expert data. Existing trajectory encoding methods often focus on specific tasks or rely on reward signals, limiting their ability to generalize across domains and tasks. Inspired by the success of embedding models like CLIP and BERT in static domains, we propose a novel method for embedding state-action trajectories into a latent space that captures the skills and competencies in the dynamic underlying decision-making processes. This method operates without the need for reward labels, enabling better generalization across diverse domains and tasks. Our contributions are threefold: (1) We introduce a trajectory embedding approach that captures multiple abilities from state-action data. (2) The learned embeddings exhibit strong representational power across downstream tasks, including imitation, classification, clustering, and regression. (3) The embeddings demonstrate unique properties, such as controlling agent behaviors in IQ-Learn and an additive structure in the latent space. Experimental results confirm that our method outperforms traditional approaches, offering more flexible and powerful trajectory representations for various applications.

We propose a non-autoregressive transformer architecture to leverage its parallel nature for easier training and fast, accurate predictions at test time. The proposed architecture divides human motion prediction into two parts: 1) the human trajectory, which is the hip joint 3D position over time and 2) the human pose which is the all other joints 3D positions over time with respect to a fixed hip joint. We propose to make the two predictions simultaneously, as the shared representation can improve the model performance. Therefore, the model consists of two sets of encoders and decoders. First, a multi-head attention module applied to encoder outputs improves human trajectory. Second, another multi-head self-attention module applied to encoder outputs concatenated with decoder outputs facilitates learning of temporal dependencies. Our model is well-suited for robotic applications in terms of test accuracy and speed, and compares favorably with respect to state-of-the-art methods. We demonstrate the real-world applicability of our work via the Robot Follow-Ahead task, a challenging yet practical case study for our proposed model.</p></details> |  |
| **[BILTS: A Bi-Invariant Similarity Measure for Robust Object Trajectory Recognition under Reference Frame Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04392v2)** | 2025-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When similar object motions are performed in diverse contexts but are meant to be recognized under a single classification, these contextual variations act as disturbances that negatively affect accurate motion recognition. In this paper, we focus on contextual variations caused by reference frame variations. To robustly deal with these variations, similarity measures have been introduced that compare object motion trajectories in a context-invariant manner. However, most are highly sensitive to noise near singularities, where the measure is not uniquely defined, and lack bi-invariance (invariance to both world and body frame variations). To address these issues, we propose the novel \textit{Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape Similarity} (BILTS) measure. Compared to other measures, the BILTS measure uniquely offers bi-invariance, boundedness, and third-order shape identity. Aimed at practical implementations, we devised a discretized and regularized version of the BILTS measure which shows exceptional robustness to singularities. This is demonstrated through rigorous recognition experiments using multiple datasets. On average, BILTS attained the highest recognition ratio and least sensitivity to contextual variations compared to other invariant object motion similarity measures. We believe that the BILTS measure is a valuable tool for recognizing motions performed in diverse contexts and has potential in other applications, including the recognition, segmentation, and adaptation of both motion and force trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the Journal of Intelligent & Robotic Systems.

We utilised a U-Net-based feature extractor, via its latent vector representation, to capture scene representations and a graph-aware transformer encoder for capturing social interactions. These components are integrated to learn an agent-scene aware embedding, enabling the model to learn spatial dynamics and forecast the future trajectory of pedestrians. The model is designed to produce both deterministic and stochastic outcomes, with the stochastic predictions being generated by incorporating a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE). ASTRA also proposes a simple yet effective weighted penalty loss function, which helps to yield predictions that outperform a wide array of state-of-the-art deterministic and generative models. ASTRA demonstrates an average improvement of 27%/10% in deterministic/stochastic settings on the ETH-UCY dataset, and 26% improvement on the PIE dataset, respectively, along with seven times fewer parameters than the existing state-of-the-art model (see Figure 1). Additionally, the model's versatility allows it to generalize across different perspectives, such as Bird's Eye View (BEV) and Ego-Vehicle View (EVV).</p></details> |  |

Strategies for planning minimum-energy trajectories typically involve solving nonlinear optimal control problems (OCPs), which rarely cope with real-time requirements. In this paper, we propose a paradigm for generating near minimum-energy trajectories for manipulators by learning from optimal solutions. Our paradigm leverages a residual learning approach, which embeds boundary conditions while focusing on learning only the adjustments needed to steer a standard solution to an optimal one. Compared to a computationally expensive OCP-based planner, our paradigm achieves 87.3% of the performance near the training dataset and 50.8% far from the dataset, while being two to three orders of magnitude faster.</p></details> |  |

The paper investigates the dynamical properties of the closed-loop systems, with a focus on characterizing undesirable behaviors that may emerge due to the use of CBF-based filters. These undesirable behaviors include unbounded trajectories, limit cycles, and undesired equilibria, which can be locally stable and even form a continuum. Our analysis offer the following contributions: (i) conditions under which trajectories remain bounded and (ii) conditions under which limit cycles do not exist; (iii) we show that undesired equilibria can be characterized by solving an algebraic equation, and (iv) we provide examples that show that asymptotically stable undesired equilibria can exist for a large class of nominal controllers and design parameters of the safety filter (even for convex safe sets). Further, for the specific class of planar systems, (v) we provide explicit formulas for the total number of undesired equilibria and the proportion of saddle points and asymptotically stable equilibria, and (vi) in the case of linear planar systems, we present an exhaustive analysis of their global stability properties. Examples throughout the paper illustrate the results.</p></details> |  |

The framework leverages the concept of regularity for set-valued output maps. Specifically, we demonstrate that, for output-regular maps, one can utilize a set-valued observability measure that is concave with respect to finite-horizon state trajectories. By maximizing this measure, optimized estimation-aware trajectories can be designed for a broad class of systems, including those with locally linearized dynamics. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we provide a representative example in the context of trajectory planning for vision-based estimation. We present an estimation-aware trajectory for an uncooperative target-tracking problem that uses a machine learning (ML)-based estimation module on an ego-satellite.</p></details> | 25 pages, 5 figures |

Current video-based hand pose reconstruction methods primarily focus on improving frame-wise 3D pose using adjacent frames rather than studying consistent 4D hand trajectories in space. Despite the additional temporal cues, they generally underperform compared to image-based methods due to the scarcity of annotated video data. To address these issues, we repurpose a state-of-the-art image-based transformer to take in multiple frames and directly predict a coherent trajectory. We introduce two types of lightweight attention layers: cross-view self-attention to fuse temporal information, and global cross-attention to bring in larger spatial context. Our method infers 4D hand trajectories similar to the ground truth while maintaining strong 2D reprojection alignment. We apply the method to both egocentric and allocentric videos. It significantly outperforms existing methods in global trajectory accuracy while being comparable to the state-of-the-art in single-image pose estimation.

However, their massive computational costs limit their widespread use, particularly in real-time applications. Structured pruning offers an effective solution by compressing models and directly providing end-to-end speed improvements, regardless of the hardware environment. Meanwhile, different components of the model exhibit varying sensitivities towards pruning, calling for \emph{non-uniform} model compression. However, a pruning method should not only identify a capable substructure, but also account for post-compression training. To this end, we propose \sysname, a method for \emph{training-aware} structured pruning. \sysname builds upon an evolutionary search process, generating multiple offspring models in each generation through mutation, and selecting the fittest for survival. To assess the effect of post-training, we incorporate a lightweight, multistep training process within the offspring population, progressively increasing the number of tokens and eliminating poorly performing models in each selection stage. We validate our method through extensive experiments on Llama-2-7B, Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-14B-Instruct, achieving state-of-the-art performance for structured pruning. For instance, \sysname surpasses ShearedLlama while requiring $5\times$ less training data during post-compression training.</p></details> |  |

Behavior Trees (BTs) are considered one of the most prominent control-policy-defining frameworks in task planning, due to their modularity, flexibility, and reusability. Generating reliable and accurate BT-based control policies for robotic systems remains challenging and often requires domain expertise. In this paper, we present the LLM-GP-BT technique that leverages the Large Language Model (LLM) and Genetic Programming (GP) to automate the generation and configuration of BTs. The LLM-GP-BT technique processes robot task commands expressed in human natural language and converts them into accurate and reliable BT-based task plans in a computationally efficient and user-friendly manner. The proposed technique is systematically developed and validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating its potential to streamline task planning for autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Conference</p></details> |

For large contexts, Key-Value caches can take up tens of gigabytes of device memory, as they store vector representations for each token and layer. Recent work has shown that the cached vectors can be compressed through quantization, pruning or merging, but these techniques often compromise quality towards higher compression rates. In this work, we aim to improve Key & Value compression by exploiting two observations: 1) the inherent dependencies between keys and values across different layers, and 2) high-compression mechanisms for internal network states. We propose AQUA-KV, an adaptive quantization for Key-Value caches that relies on compact adapters to exploit existing dependencies between Keys and Values, and aims to "optimally" compress the information that cannot be predicted. AQUA-KV significantly improves compression rates, while maintaining high accuracy on state-of-the-art LLM families. On Llama 3.2 LLMs, we achieve near-lossless inference at 2-2.5 bits per value with under $1\%$ relative error in perplexity and LongBench scores. AQUA-KV is one-shot, simple, and efficient: it can be calibrated on a single GPU within 1-6 hours, even for 70B models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under review</p></details> |
| **[Large Continual Instruction Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10868v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual Instruction Tuning (CIT) is adopted to continually instruct Large Models to follow human intent data by data. It is observed that existing gradient update would heavily destroy the performance on previous datasets during CIT process. Instead, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), owns the ability to trace previous parameters, which can aid in decreasing forgetting. Nonetheless, its stable balance weight fails to deal with the ever-changing datasets, leading to the out-of-balance between plasticity and stability. In this paper, we propose a general continual instruction tuning framework to address the challenge. Starting from the trade-off prerequisite and EMA update, we propose the plasticity and stability ideal condition. Based on Taylor expansion in the loss function, we find the optimal balance weight can be automatically determined by the gradients and learned parameters. Therefore, we propose a stable-plasticity balanced coefficient to avoid knowledge confusion. Based on the semantic similarity of the instructions, we can determine whether to retrain or expand the training parameters and allocate the most suitable parameters for the testing instances. Extensive experiments across multiple continual instruction tuning benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only enhances anti-forgetting capabilities but also significantly improves overall continual tuning performance. For example, based on LLaVA-7B, the forgetting is reduced from 5.42 to 1.93. Our code will be made publicly available soon.</p></details> |  |

When such autotelic exploration is achieved by LLM agents trained with online RL in high-dimensional and evolving goal spaces, a key challenge for LP prediction is modeling one's own competence, a form of metacognitive monitoring. Traditional approaches either require extensive sampling or rely on brittle expert-defined goal groupings. We introduce MAGELLAN, a metacognitive framework that lets LLM agents learn to predict their competence and LP online. By capturing semantic relationships between goals, MAGELLAN enables sample-efficient LP estimation and dynamic adaptation to evolving goal spaces through generalization. In an interactive learning environment, we show that MAGELLAN improves LP prediction efficiency and goal prioritization, being the only method allowing the agent to fully master a large and evolving goal space. These results demonstrate how augmenting LLM agents with a metacognitive ability for LP predictions can effectively scale curriculum learning to open-ended goal spaces.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate the relationship between pre-training and fine-tuning by fine-tuning multiple intermediate pre-trained model checkpoints. Our results on 18 datasets suggest that i) continual pre-training improves the model in a latent way that unveils after fine-tuning; ii) with extra fine-tuning, the datasets that the model does not demonstrate capability gain much more than those that the model performs well during the pre-training stage; iii) although model benefits significantly through supervised fine-tuning, it may forget previously known domain knowledge and the tasks that are not seen during fine-tuning; iv) the model resembles high sensitivity to evaluation prompts after supervised fine-tuning, but this sensitivity can be alleviated by more pre-training.</p></details> | Updated Draft |
| **[Large Language Models as Proxies for Theories of Human Linguistic Cognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07687v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the possible role of current large language models (LLMs) in the study of human linguistic cognition. We focus on the use of such models as proxies for theories of cognition that are relatively linguistically-neutral in their representations and learning but differ from current LLMs in key ways. We illustrate this potential use of LLMs as proxies for theories of cognition in the context of two kinds of questions: (a) whether the target theory accounts for the acquisition of a given pattern from a given corpus; and (b) whether the target theory makes a given typologically-attested pattern easier to acquire than another, typologically-unattested pattern. For each of the two questions we show, building on recent literature, how current LLMs can potentially be of help, but we note that at present this help is quite limited.</p></details> |  |

Matrix3D utilizes a multi-modal diffusion transformer (DiT) to integrate transformations across several modalities, such as images, camera parameters, and depth maps. The key to Matrix3D's large-scale multi-modal training lies in the incorporation of a mask learning strategy. This enables full-modality model training even with partially complete data, such as bi-modality data of image-pose and image-depth pairs, thus significantly increases the pool of available training data. Matrix3D demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in pose estimation and novel view synthesis tasks. Additionally, it offers fine-grained control through multi-round interactions, making it an innovative tool for 3D content creation.

One prominent theory presents the notion that constituent ordering is directly correlated with constituent weight: a measure of the constituent's length or complexity. Such theories are interesting in the context of natural language processing (NLP), because while recent advances in NLP have led to significant gains in the performance of large language models (LLMs), much remains unclear about how these models process language, and how this compares to human language processing. In particular, the question remains whether LLMs display the same patterns with constituent movement, and may provide insights into existing theories on when and how the shift occurs in human language. We compare a variety of LLMs with diverse properties to evaluate broad LLM performance on four types of constituent movement: heavy NP shift, particle movement, dative alternation, and multiple PPs. Despite performing unexpectedly around particle movement, LLMs generally align with human preferences around constituent ordering.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, traditional text-trained or numeric similarity-based retrieval methods often struggle to handle the intricacies of financial data. To address this, we propose the first retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: a fine-tuned 1B large language model (StockLLM) as its backbone, a novel candidate selection method enhanced by LLM feedback, and a training objective that maximizes the similarity between queries and historically significant sequences. These advancements enable our retriever, FinSeer, to uncover meaningful patterns while effectively minimizing noise in complex financial datasets. To support robust evaluation, we also construct new datasets that integrate financial indicators and historical stock prices. Experimental results demonstrate that our RAG framework outperforms both the baseline StockLLM and random retrieval methods, showcasing its effectiveness. FinSeer, as the retriever, achieves an 8% higher accuracy on the BIGDATA22 benchmark and retrieves more impactful sequences compared to existing retrieval methods. This work highlights the importance of tailored retrieval models in financial forecasting and provides a novel, scalable framework for future research in the field.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Violating the ERC rules could cause serious security issues and financial loss, signifying the importance of verifying smart contracts follow ERCs. Today's practices of such verification are to manually audit each single contract, use expert-developed program-analysis tools, or use large language models (LLMs), all of which are far from effective in identifying ERC rule violations. This paper introduces SymGPT, a tool that combines the natural language understanding of large language models (LLMs) with the formal guarantees of symbolic execution to automatically verify smart contracts' compliance with ERC rules. To develop SymGPT, we conduct an empirical study of 132 ERC rules from three widely used ERC standards, examining their content, security implications, and natural language descriptions. Based on this study, we design SymGPT by first instructing an LLM to translate ERC rules into a defined EBNF grammar. We then synthesize constraints from the formalized rules to represent scenarios where violations may occur and use symbolic execution to detect them. Our evaluation shows that SymGPT identifies 5,783 ERC rule violations in 4,000 real-world contracts, including 1,375 violations with clear attack paths for stealing financial assets, demonstrating its effectiveness. Furthermore, SymGPT outperforms six automated techniques and a security-expert auditing service, underscoring its superiority over current smart contract analysis methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.04306</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose to control the LLM via touch gestures performed directly on the text. We first chart a design space that covers fundamental touch input and text transformations. In this space, we then concretely explore two control mappings: spread-to-generate and pinch-to-shorten, with visual feedback loops. We evaluate this concept in a user study (N=14) that compares three feedback designs: no visualisation, text length indicator, and length + word indicator. The results demonstrate that touch-based control of LLMs is both feasible and user-friendly, with the length + word indicator proving most effective for managing text generation. This work lays the foundation for further research into gesture-based interaction with LLMs on touch devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, 3 tables, ACM CHI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Prompting: Time2Lang -- Bridging Time-Series Foundation Models and Large Language Models for Health Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07608v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at CHIL 2025</p></details> |

Several deep learning and transformer-based models have been proposed for this task over the years. With the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their superior performance in several NLP tasks, we have seen a surge of LLM-based approaches to claim verification along with the use of novel methods such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). In this survey, we present a comprehensive account of recent claim verification frameworks using LLMs. We describe the different components of the claim verification pipeline used in these frameworks in detail including common approaches to retrieval, prompting, and fine-tuning. Finally, we describe publicly available English datasets created for this task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection and Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07601v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection (ZSAD) is an emerging AD paradigm. Unlike the traditional unsupervised AD setting that requires a large number of normal samples to train a model, ZSAD is more practical for handling data-restricted real-world scenarios. Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown revolutionary reasoning capabilities in various vision tasks. However, the reasoning of image abnormalities remains underexplored due to the lack of corresponding datasets and benchmarks. To facilitate research in AD & reasoning, we establish the first visual instruction tuning dataset, Anomaly-Instruct-125k, and the evaluation benchmark, VisA-D&R. Through investigation with our benchmark, we reveal that current MLLMs like GPT-4o cannot accurately detect and describe fine-grained anomalous details in images. To address this, we propose Anomaly-OneVision (Anomaly-OV), the first specialist visual assistant for ZSAD and reasoning. Inspired by human behavior in visual inspection, Anomaly-OV leverages a Look-Twice Feature Matching (LTFM) mechanism to adaptively select and emphasize abnormal visual tokens. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Anomaly-OV achieves significant improvements over advanced generalist models in both detection and reasoning. Extensions to medical and 3D AD are provided for future study. The link to our project page: https://xujiacong.github.io/Anomaly-OV/</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

However, the quadratic computational complexity of 3D full attention mechanism presents significant challenges in scaling video DiT training, especially for high-definition and lengthy videos, where attention can dominate up to 95% of the end-to-end time and necessitate specialized communication paradigms to handle large input sizes. This paper introduces DSV, a novel framework designed to accelerate and scale the training of video DiTs by leveraging the inherent dynamic attention sparsity throughout the training process. DSV employs a two-stage training algorithm that exploits sparsity patterns, focusing on critical elements supported by efficient, tailored kernels. To accommodate the new sparsity dimension, we develop a hybrid sparsity-aware context parallelism that effectively scales to large inputs by addressing the heterogeneity of sparsity across attention heads and blocks, resulting in optimized sparse computation and communication. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that DSV achieves up to 3.02x gain in training throughput with nearly no quality degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03307v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intent-based recommender systems have garnered significant attention for uncovering latent fine-grained preferences. Intents, as underlying factors of interactions, are crucial for improving recommendation interpretability. Most methods define intents as learnable parameters updated alongside interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook textual information (e.g., user reviews, item descriptions), which is crucial for alleviating the sparsity of interaction intents. Exploring these multimodal intents, especially the inherent differences in representation spaces, poses two key challenges: i) How to align multimodal intents and effectively mitigate noise issues; ii) How to extract and match latent key intents across modalities. To tackle these challenges, we propose a model-agnostic framework, Intent Representation Learning with Large Language Model (IRLLRec), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to construct multimodal intents and enhance recommendations. Specifically, IRLLRec employs a dual-tower architecture to learn multimodal intent representations. Next, we propose pairwise and translation alignment to eliminate inter-modal differences and enhance robustness against noisy input features. Finally, to better match textual and interaction-based intents, we employ momentum distillation to perform teacher-student learning on fused intent representations. Empirical evaluations on three datasets show that our IRLLRec framework outperforms baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

At the same time, LLMs possess large parameter sizes and use key-value caches to store context information. Modern LLMs support context windows with up to 1 million tokens to generate versatile text, audio, and video content. A large key-value cache unique to each prompt requires a large memory capacity, limiting the inference batch size. Both low operational intensity and limited batch size necessitate a high memory bandwidth. However, contemporary hardware systems for ML model deployment, such as GPUs and TPUs, are primarily optimized for compute throughput. This mismatch challenges the efficient deployment of advanced LLMs and makes users to pay for expensive compute resources that are poorly utilized for the memory-bound LLM inference tasks. We propose CENT, a CXL-ENabled GPU-Free sysTem for LLM inference, which harnesses CXL memory expansion capabilities to accommodate substantial LLM sizes, and utilizes near-bank processing units to deliver high memory bandwidth, eliminating the need for expensive GPUs. CENT exploits a scalable CXL network to support peer-to-peer and collective communication primitives across CXL devices. We implement various parallelism strategies to distribute LLMs across these devices. Compared to GPU baselines with maximum supported batch sizes and similar average power, CENT achieves 2.3$\times$ higher throughput and consumes 2.3$\times$ less energy. CENT enhances the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO), generating 5.2$\times$ more tokens per dollar than GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 30th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 2 (ASPLOS'25)</p></details> |

They can be challenging to analyze. Finding the root cause requires extensive manual effort and expertise to connect information sources like stack traces, source code, and logs. Typical approaches to fault localization require either test failures or source code. Crashes occurring in production environments, such as that of SAP HANA, provide solely crash logs and stack traces. We present a novel approach to localize faults based only on the stack trace information and no additional runtime information, by fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). We address complex cases where the root cause of a crash differs from the technical cause, and is not located in the innermost frame of the stack trace. As the number of historic crashes is insufficient to fine-tune LLMs, we augment our dataset by leveraging code mutators to inject synthetic crashes into the code base. By fine-tuning on 64,369 crashes resulting from 4.1 million mutations of the HANA code base, we can correctly predict the root cause location of a crash with an accuracy of 66.9\% while baselines only achieve 12.6% and 10.6%. We substantiate the generalizability of our approach by evaluating on two additional open-source databases, SQLite and DuckDB, achieving accuracies of 63% and 74%, respectively. Across all our experiments, fine-tuning consistently outperformed prompting non-finetuned LLMs for localizing faults in our datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>I do ...</summary><p>I do not have the necessary approvals to out the paper on Arxiv from my organization yet.

Some defenses have been proposed to detect or mitigate jailbreaks, but they are unable to withstand the test of time due to an insufficient understanding of jailbreak mechanisms. In this work, we investigate the mechanisms behind jailbreaks based on the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH), which states that neural networks encode high-level concepts as subspaces in their hidden representations. We define the toxic semantics in harmful and jailbreak prompts as toxic concepts and describe the semantics in jailbreak prompts that manipulate LLMs to comply with unsafe requests as jailbreak concepts. Through concept extraction and analysis, we reveal that LLMs can recognize the toxic concepts in both harmful and jailbreak prompts. However, unlike harmful prompts, jailbreak prompts activate the jailbreak concepts and alter the LLM output from rejection to compliance. Building on our analysis, we propose a comprehensive jailbreak defense framework, JBShield, consisting of two key components: jailbreak detection JBShield-D and mitigation JBShield-M. JBShield-D identifies jailbreak prompts by determining whether the input activates both toxic and jailbreak concepts. When a jailbreak prompt is detected, JBShield-M adjusts the hidden representations of the target LLM by enhancing the toxic concept and weakening the jailbreak concept, ensuring LLMs produce safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of JBShield, achieving an average detection accuracy of 0.95 and reducing the average attack success rate of various jailbreak attacks to 2% from 61% across distinct LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in the 34rd USENIX Security Symposium, August 13-15, 2025</p></details> |

However, the potential of conformity within these systems, analogous to phenomena like conformity bias and groupthink in human group dynamics, remains largely unexplored, raising concerns about their collective problem-solving capabilities and possible ethical implications. This paper presents a comprehensive study on conformity in LLM-driven multi-agent systems, focusing on three aspects: the existence of conformity, the factors influencing conformity, and potential mitigation strategies. In particular, we introduce BenchForm, a new conformity-oriented benchmark, featuring reasoning-intensive tasks and five distinct interaction protocols designed to probe LLMs' behavior in collaborative scenarios. Several representative LLMs are evaluated on BenchForm, using metrics such as conformity rate and independence rate to quantify conformity's impact. Our analysis delves into factors influencing conformity, including interaction time and majority size, and examines how the subject agent rationalizes its conforming behavior. Furthermore, we explore two strategies to mitigate conformity effects, i.e., developing enhanced personas and implementing a reflection mechanism. Several interesting findings regarding LLMs' conformity are derived from empirical results and case studies. We hope that these insights can pave the way for more robust and ethically-aligned collaborative AI systems.

While low-bit quantized weights can reduce memory usage and improve inference efficiency, current hardware lacks native support for mixed-precision General Matrix Multiplication (mpGEMM), resulting in inefficient dequantization-based implementations. Moreover, uniform quantization methods often fail to capture weight distributions adequately, leading to performance degradation. We propose GANQ (GPU-Adaptive Non-Uniform Quantization), a layer-wise post-training non-uniform quantization framework optimized for hardware-efficient lookup table-based mpGEMM. GANQ achieves superior quantization performance by utilizing a training-free, GPU-adaptive optimization algorithm to efficiently reduce layer-wise quantization errors. Extensive experiments demonstrate GANQ's ability to reduce the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline compared to state-of-the-art methods for both 3-bit and 4-bit quantization. Furthermore, when deployed on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU, GANQ's quantized models achieve up to 2.57$\times$ speedup over the baseline, advancing memory and inference efficiency in LLM deployment.</p></details> |  |

Its goal is to organize news chronologically, which helps to identify patterns and trends that may be obscured when viewing news in isolation, making it easier to track the development of stories and understand the interrelationships between key events. Timelines are now common in various commercial products, but academic research in this area is notably scarce. Additionally, the current datasets are in need of refinement for enhanced utility and expanded coverage. In this paper, we propose ETimeline, which encompasses over $13,000$ news articles, spanning $600$ bilingual timelines across $28$ news domains. Specifically, we gather a candidate pool of more than $120,000$ news articles and employ the large language model (LLM) Pipeline to improve performance, ultimately yielding the ETimeline. The data analysis underscores the appeal of ETimeline. Additionally, we also provide the news pool data for further research and analysis. This work contributes to the advancement of timeline generation research and supports a wide range of tasks, including topic generation and event relationships. We believe that this dataset will serve as a catalyst for innovative research and bridge the gap between academia and industry in understanding the practical application of technology services.

This letter focuses on in-grasp object movement, which refers to manipulating an object to a desired pose through only finger motions within a stable grasp. The key challenge lies in simultaneously achieving high precision and large-range movements while maintaining a constant stable grasp.

To investigate this, we presented approximately forty models from major providers with a structured set of ethical scenarios, creating one of the largest datasets of its kind. Our rationality tests revealed that at least one model from each provider exhibited behavior consistent with approximately stable moral principles, effectively acting as if nearly optimizing a utility function encoding ethical reasoning. We estimated these utility functions and found that models tend to cluster around neutral ethical stances. To further characterize moral heterogeneity, we applied a non-parametric permutation approach, constructing a probabilistic similarity network based on revealed preference patterns. This analysis showed that while approximately rational models share a core ethical structure, differences emerged: roughly half displayed greater moral adaptability, bridging diverse perspectives, while the remainder adhered to more rigid ethical structures.</p></details> |  |

However, this often leads to degraded performance on short-text tasks, while the reasons for this degradation remain insufficiently explored. In this work, we identify two primary factors contributing to this issue: distribution drift in hidden states and attention scores, and catastrophic forgetting during continual pre-training. To address these challenges, we propose Long Context Pre-training with Restoration Distillation (LongReD), a novel approach designed to mitigate short-text performance degradation through minimizing the distribution discrepancy between the extended and original models. Besides training on long texts, LongReD distills the hidden state of selected layers from the original model on short texts. Additionally, LongReD also introduces a short-to-long distillation, aligning the output distribution on short texts with that on long texts by leveraging skipped positional indices. Experiments on common text benchmarks demonstrate that LongReD effectively preserves the model's short-text performance while maintaining comparable or even better capacity to handle long texts than baselines.</p></details> |  |

In digital library systems, topic modeling plays a crucial role in efficiently organizing and retrieving scholarly content, guiding researchers through complex knowledge landscapes. As research domains proliferate and shift, traditional human centric and static evaluation methods struggle to maintain relevance. The proposed approach harnesses LLMs to measure key quality dimensions, such as coherence, repetitiveness, diversity, and topic-document alignment, without heavy reliance on expert annotators or narrow statistical metrics. Tailored prompts guide LLM assessments, ensuring consistent and interpretable evaluations across various datasets and modeling techniques. Experiments on benchmark corpora demonstrate the method's robustness, scalability, and adaptability, underscoring its value as a more holistic and dynamic alternative to conventional evaluation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IRCDL 2025</p></details> |

However, measuring these advanced capabilities across languages is underexplored. To address the disparity, we introduce BenchMAX, a multi-way multilingual evaluation benchmark that allows for fair comparisons of these important abilities across languages. To maintain high quality, three distinct native-speaking annotators independently annotate each sample within all tasks after the data was machine-translated from English into 16 other languages. Additionally, we present a novel translation challenge stemming from dataset construction. Extensive experiments on BenchMAX reveal varying effectiveness of core capabilities across languages, highlighting performance gaps that cannot be bridged by simply scaling up model size. BenchMAX serves as a comprehensive multilingual evaluation platform, providing a promising test bed to promote the development of multilingual language models. The dataset and code are publicly accessible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Memory Network for Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05558v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling user behavior sequences in recommender systems is essential for understanding user preferences over time, enabling personalized and accurate recommendations for improving user retention and enhancing business values. Despite its significance, there are two challenges for current sequential modeling approaches. From the spatial dimension, it is difficult to mutually perceive similar users' interests for a generalized intention understanding; from the temporal dimension, current methods are generally prone to forgetting long-term interests due to the fixed-length input sequence. In this paper, we present Large Memory Network (LMN), providing a novel idea by compressing and storing user history behavior information in a large-scale memory block. With the elaborated online deployment strategy, the memory block can be easily scaled up to million-scale in the industry. Extensive offline comparison experiments, memory scaling up experiments, and online A/B test on Douyin E-Commerce Search (ECS) are performed, validating the superior performance of LMN. Currently, LMN has been fully deployed in Douyin ECS, serving millions of users each day.</p></details> |  |

While traditional methods for training on long contexts often use filtered long documents, these approaches lead to domain imbalances, limiting model performance. To address this, techniques like random document concatenation (Standard) and similarity-based methods (KNN, ICLM) have been developed. However, they either sacrifice semantic coherence or diversity. To balance both aspects, we introduce Quest, a query-centric data synthesis method aggregating semantically relevant yet diverse documents. Quest uses a generative model to predict potential queries for each document, grouping documents with similar queries and keywords. Extensive experiments demonstrate Quest's superior performance on long-context tasks, achieving remarkable results with context lengths of up to 1M tokens and confirming its scalability across various model sizes.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

However, effectively aligning LLMs with specific human groups and systematically assessing the fidelity of the alignment remains a challenge. This paper presents a robust framework for aligning LLMs with online communities via instruction-tuning and comprehensively evaluating alignment across various aspects of language, including authenticity, emotional tone, toxicity, and harm. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by applying it to online communities centered on dieting and body image. We administer an eating disorder psychometric test to the aligned LLMs to reveal unhealthy beliefs and successfully differentiate communities with varying levels of eating disorder risk. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs in automated moderation and broader applications in public health and social science research.</p></details> |  |

However, the practical limits of classical simulatability for quantum circuits remain unclear, especially with current noisy quantum devices. In this work, we explore the potential of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate the output of a quantum Turing machine using Grover's quantum circuits, known to provide quadratic speedups over classical counterparts. To this end, we developed GroverGPT, a specialized model based on LLaMA's 8-billion-parameter architecture, trained on over 15 trillion tokens. Unlike brute-force state-vector simulations, which demand substantial computational resources, GroverGPT employs pattern recognition to approximate quantum search algorithms without explicitly representing quantum states. Analyzing 97K quantum search instances, GroverGPT consistently outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o (45\% accuracy), achieving nearly 100\% accuracy on 6- and 10-qubit datasets when trained on 4-qubit or larger datasets. It also demonstrated strong generalization, surpassing 95\% accuracy for systems with over 20 qubits when trained on 3- to 6-qubit data. Analysis indicates GroverGPT captures quantum features of Grover's search rather than classical patterns, supported by novel prompting strategies to enhance performance. Although accuracy declines with increasing system size, these findings offer insights into the practical boundaries of classical simulatability. This work suggests task-specific LLMs can surpass general-purpose models like GPT-4o in quantum algorithm learning and serve as powerful tools for advancing quantum research.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages including appendices. v2, v3: Add more experiments include ablation tests.

The Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique is further incorporated into these systems to retrieve more relevant items and improve system performance. However, existing RAG methods rely primarily on textual semantics and often fail to incorporate the most relevant items, limiting the effectiveness of the systems. In this paper, we propose Representation learning for retrieval-Augmented Large Language model Recommendation (RALLRec). Specifically, we enhance textual semantics by prompting LLMs to generate more detailed item descriptions, followed by joint representation learning of textual and collaborative semantics, which are extracted by the LLM and recommendation models, respectively. Considering the potential time-varying characteristics of user interest, a simple yet effective reranking method is further introduced to capture the dynamics of user preference. We conducted extensive experiments on three real-world datasets, and the evaluation results validated the effectiveness of our method.

Traditional approaches approximate the value functions as piecewise linear convex functions by incrementally accumulating subgradient cutting planes from the primal and dual solutions of stagewise subproblems. Recognizing these limitations, we introduce TranSDDP, a novel Transformer-based stagewise decomposition algorithm. This innovative approach leverages the structural advantages of the Transformer model, implementing a sequential method for integrating subgradient cutting planes to approximate the value function. Through our numerical experiments, we affirm TranSDDP's effectiveness in addressing MSP problems. It efficiently generates a piecewise linear approximation for the value function, significantly reducing computation time while preserving solution quality, thus marking a promising progression in the treatment of large-scale multistage stochastic programming problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2023 (Oral Presentation)</p></details> |

Two fundamental limitations hinder current approaches: (1) the lack of a comprehensive suction grasp dataset tailored for parcel manipulation tasks, and (2) insufficient adaptability to diverse object characteristics including size variations, geometric complexity, and textural diversity. To address these challenges, we present Parcel-Suction-Dataset, a large-scale synthetic dataset containing 25 thousand cluttered scenes with 410 million precision-annotated suction grasp poses. This dataset is generated through our novel geometric sampling algorithm that enables efficient generation of optimal suction grasps incorporating both physical constraints and material properties. We further propose Diffusion-Suction, an innovative framework that reformulates suction grasp prediction as a conditional generation task through denoising diffusion probabilistic models. Our method iteratively refines random noise into suction grasp score maps through visual-conditioned guidance from point cloud observations, effectively learning spatial point-wise affordances from our synthetic dataset. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the simple yet efficient Diffusion-Suction achieves new state-of-the-art performance compared to previous models on both Parcel-Suction-Dataset and the public SuctionNet-1Billion benchmark.</p></details> |  |

This research delves into the realm of drug optimization and introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm to finetune a drug optimization LLM-based generative model, enhancing the original drug across target objectives, while retains the beneficial chemical properties of the original drug. This work is comprised of two primary components: (1) DrugImprover: A framework tailored for improving robustness and efficiency in drug optimization. It includes a LLM designed for drug optimization and a novel Structured Policy Optimization (SPO) algorithm, which is theoretically grounded. This algorithm offers a unique perspective for fine-tuning the LLM-based generative model by aligning the improvement of the generated molecule with the input molecule under desired objectives. (2) A dataset of 1 million compounds, each with OEDOCK docking scores on 5 human proteins associated with cancer cells and 24 binding sites from SARS-CoV-2 virus. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of SPO and demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the original drug across target properties.

| **[A Memory Efficient Randomized Subspace Optimization Method for Training Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07222v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The memory challenges associated with training Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a critical concern, particularly when using the Adam optimizer. To address this issue, numerous memory-efficient techniques have been proposed, with GaLore standing out as a notable example designed to reduce the memory footprint of optimizer states. However, these approaches do not alleviate the memory burden imposed by activations, rendering them unsuitable for scenarios involving long context sequences or large mini-batches. Moreover, their convergence properties are still not well-understood in the literature. In this work, we introduce a Randomized Subspace Optimization framework for pre-training and fine-tuning LLMs. Our approach decomposes the high-dimensional training problem into a series of lower-dimensional subproblems. At each iteration, a random subspace is selected, and the parameters within that subspace are optimized. This structured reduction in dimensionality allows our method to simultaneously reduce memory usage for both activations and optimizer states. We establish comprehensive convergence guarantees and derive rates for various scenarios, accommodating different optimization strategies to solve the subproblems. Extensive experiments validate the superior memory and communication efficiency of our method, achieving performance comparable to GaLore and Adam.</p></details> |  |
| **[GT2Vec: Large Language Models as Multi-Modal Encoders for Text and Graph-Structured Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11235v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph-structured information offers rich contextual information that can enhance language models by providing structured relationships and hierarchies, leading to more expressive embeddings for various applications such as retrieval, question answering, and classification. However, existing methods for integrating graph and text embeddings, often based on Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLPs) or shallow transformers, are limited in their ability to fully exploit the heterogeneous nature of these modalities. To overcome this, we propose GT2Vec, a simple yet effective framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to jointly encode text and graph data. Specifically, GT2Vec employs an MLP adapter to project graph embeddings into the same space as text embeddings, allowing the LLM to process both modalities jointly. Unlike prior work, we also introduce contrastive learning to align the graph and text spaces more effectively, thereby improving the quality of learned joint embeddings. Empirical results across six datasets spanning three tasks, knowledge graph-contextualized question answering, graph-text pair classification, and retrieval, demonstrate that GT2Vec consistently outperforms existing baselines, achieving significant improvements across multiple datasets. These results highlight GT2Vec's effectiveness in integrating graph and text data. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Recurrent Diffusion for Large Scale Parameter Generation (RPG), a novel framework that generates full neural network parameters up to hundreds of millions on a single GPU. Our approach first partitions a networks parameters into non-overlapping tokens, each corresponding to a distinct portion of the model. A recurrent mechanism then learns the inter token relationships, producing prototypes which serve as conditions for a diffusion process that ultimately synthesizes the full parameters. Across a spectrum of architectures and tasks including ResNets, ConvNeXts and ViTs on ImageNet 1K and COCO, and even LoRA based LLMs RPG achieves performance on par with fully trained networks while avoiding excessive memory overhead. Notably, it generalizes beyond its training set to generate valid parameters for previously unseen tasks, highlighting its flexibility in dynamic and open ended scenarios. By overcoming the longstanding memory and scalability barriers, RPG serves as a critical advance in AI generating AI, potentially enabling efficient weight generation at scales previously deemed infeasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Gener...</summary><p>Generating 200 million parameters in just minutes</p></details> |

Looking through numerous hallucination-related studies, a mainstream category of methods is to reduce hallucinations by optimizing the knowledge representation of LLMs to change their output. Considering that the core focus of these works is the knowledge acquired by models, and knowledge has long been a central theme in human societal progress, we believe that the process of models refining knowledge can greatly benefit from the way humans learn. In our work, by imitating the human learning process, we design an Adaptive Contrastive Learning strategy. Our method flexibly constructs different positive and negative samples for contrastive learning based on LLMs' actual mastery of knowledge. This strategy helps LLMs consolidate the correct knowledge they already possess, deepen their understanding of the correct knowledge they have encountered but not fully grasped, forget the incorrect knowledge they previously learned, and honestly acknowledge the knowledge they lack. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses on widely used datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, a comprehensive evaluation of their long-context capabilities remains underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce the MultiModal Needle-in-a-haystack (MMNeedle) benchmark, specifically designed to assess the long-context capabilities of MLLMs. Besides multi-image input, we employ image stitching to further increase the input context length, and develop a protocol to automatically generate labels for sub-image level retrieval. Essentially, MMNeedle evaluates MLLMs by stress-testing their capability to locate a target sub-image (needle) within a set of images (haystack) based on textual instructions and descriptions of image contents. This setup necessitates an advanced understanding of extensive visual contexts and effective information retrieval within long-context image inputs. With this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art MLLMs, encompassing both API-based and open-source models. The findings reveal that GPT-4o consistently surpasses other models in long-context scenarios, but suffers from hallucination problems in negative samples, i.e., when needles are not in the haystacks. Our comprehensive long-context evaluation of MLLMs also sheds lights on the considerable performance gap between API-based and open-source models.

| **[Avoiding Copyright Infringement via Large Language Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10952v3)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities but also pose risks by learning and generating copyrighted material, leading to significant legal and ethical concerns. In real-world scenarios, model owners need to continuously address copyright infringement as new requests for content removal emerge at different time points. This leads to the need for sequential unlearning, where copyrighted content is removed sequentially as new requests arise. Despite its practical relevance, sequential unlearning in the context of copyright infringement has not been rigorously explored in existing literature. To address this gap, we propose Stable Sequential Unlearning (SSU), a novel framework designed to unlearn copyrighted content from LLMs over multiple time steps. Our approach works by identifying and removing specific weight updates in the model's parameters that correspond to copyrighted content. We improve unlearning efficacy by introducing random labeling loss and ensuring the model retains its general-purpose knowledge by adjusting targeted parameters. Experimental results show that SSU achieves an effective trade-off between unlearning efficacy and general-purpose language abilities, outperforming existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional single-robot and multi-agent systems, MRS poses unique challenges, including coordination, scalability, and real-world adaptability. This survey provides the first comprehensive exploration of LLM integration into MRS. It systematically categorizes their applications across high-level task allocation, mid-level motion planning, low-level action generation, and human intervention. We highlight key applications in diverse domains, such as household robotics, construction, formation control, target tracking, and robot games, showcasing the versatility and transformative potential of LLMs in MRS. Furthermore, we examine the challenges that limit adapting LLMs in MRS, including mathematical reasoning limitations, hallucination, latency issues, and the need for robust benchmarking systems. Finally, we outline opportunities for future research, emphasizing advancements in fine-tuning, reasoning techniques, and task-specific models. This survey aims to guide researchers in the intelligence and real-world deployment of MRS powered by LLMs. Based on the fast-evolving nature of research in the field, we keep updating the papers in the open-source Github repository.</p></details> |  |

We investigate graph coloring as a means of evaluating an LLM's capacities for systematic step-by-step reasoning and possibility space exploration, as well as effects of semantic problem framing. We test Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 405B, Gemini 1.5 Pro, GPT-4o, o1-mini, and DeepSeek-R1 on a dataset of $k$-coloring problems with $2 \leq k \leq 4$ and vertex count $4 \leq n \leq 8$, using partial algorithmic solvers to further categorize problems by difficulty. In addition to substantial but varying framing effects, we find that all models except o1-mini and R1 exhibit $>60\%$ error rates on difficult problem types in all frames ($>15\%$ for o1-mini and $>10\%$ for R1), and no model achieves perfect accuracy even in the simple domain of 2-coloring 4-vertex graphs. Our results highlight both the considerable recent progress in LLM systematic reasoning and the limits of its reliability, especially in relation to increasing computational costs. We expect that more complex graph coloring problems, and procedural generation of arbitrary-complexity reasoning problems more broadly, offer further untapped potential for LLM benchmarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages (8 excluding references and appendices); 8 figures (3 excluding appendices)</p></details> |

Here, we present a novel method for empirically evaluating anthropomorphic LLM behaviours in realistic and varied settings. Going beyond single-turn static benchmarks, we contribute three methodological advances in state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLM evaluation. First, we develop a multi-turn evaluation of 14 anthropomorphic behaviours. Second, we present a scalable, automated approach by employing simulations of user interactions. Third, we conduct an interactive, large-scale human subject study (N=1101) to validate that the model behaviours we measure predict real users' anthropomorphic perceptions. We find that all SOTA LLMs evaluated exhibit similar behaviours, characterised by relationship-building (e.g., empathy and validation) and first-person pronoun use, and that the majority of behaviours only first occur after multiple turns. Our work lays an empirical foundation for investigating how design choices influence anthropomorphic model behaviours and for progressing the ethical debate on the desirability of these behaviours. It also showcases the necessity of multi-turn evaluations for complex social phenomena in human-AI interaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[IRepair: An Intent-Aware Approach to Repair Data-Driven Errors in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07072v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Not a day goes by without hearing about the impressive feats of large language models (LLMs), and equally, not a day passes without hearing about their challenges. LLMs are notoriously vulnerable to biases in their dataset, leading to issues such as toxicity. While domain-adaptive training has been employed to mitigate these issues, these techniques often address all model parameters indiscriminately during the repair process, resulting in poor repair quality and reduced model versatility. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic slicing-based intent-aware LLM repair strategy, IRepair. This approach selectively targets the most error-prone sections of the model for repair. Specifically, we propose dynamically slicing the model's most sensitive layers that require immediate attention, concentrating repair efforts on those areas. This method enables more effective repairs with potentially less impact on the model's overall performance by altering a smaller portion of the model. We evaluated our technique on three models from the GPT2 and GPT-Neo families, with parameters ranging from 800M to 1.6B, in a toxicity mitigation setup. Our results show that IRepair repairs errors 43.6% more effectively while causing 46% less disruption to general performance compared to the closest baseline, direct preference optimization. Our empirical analysis also reveals that errors are more concentrated in a smaller section of the model, with the top 20% of layers exhibiting 773% more error density than the remaining 80\%. This highlights the need for selective repair. Additionally, we demonstrate that a dynamic selection approach is essential for addressing errors dispersed throughout the model, ensuring a robust and efficient repair.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full research paper at FSE'2025</p></details> |

If we could accurately simulate group-level survey results, this would therefore be very valuable to social science research. Prior work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for simulating human behaviors, mostly through prompting. In this paper, we are the first to specialize LLMs for the task of simulating survey response distributions. As a testbed, we use country-level results from two global cultural surveys. We devise a fine-tuning method based on first-token probabilities to minimize divergence between predicted and actual response distributions for a given question. Then, we show that this method substantially outperforms other methods and zero-shot classifiers, even on unseen questions, countries, and a completely unseen survey. While even our best models struggle with the task, especially on unseen questions, our results demonstrate the benefits of specialization for simulation, which may accelerate progress towards sufficiently accurate simulation in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, accepted to NAACL 2025 main</p></details> |

| **[Demystifying Singular Defects in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07004v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large transformer models are known to produce high-norm tokens. In vision transformers (ViTs), such tokens have been mathematically modeled through the singular vectors of the linear approximations of layers. However, in large language models (LLMs), the underlying causes of high-norm tokens remain largely unexplored, and their different properties from those of ViTs require a new analysis framework. In this paper, we provide both theoretical insights and empirical validation across a range of recent models, leading to the following observations: i) The layer-wise singular direction predicts the abrupt explosion of token norms in LLMs. ii) The negative eigenvalues of a layer explain its sudden decay. iii) The computational pathways leading to high-norm tokens differ between initial and noninitial tokens. iv) High-norm tokens are triggered by the right leading singular vector of the matrix approximating the corresponding modules. We showcase two practical applications of these findings: the improvement of quantization schemes and the design of LLM signatures. Our findings not only advance the understanding of singular defects in LLMs but also open new avenues for their application. We expect that this work will stimulate further research into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and will therefore publicly release our code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine Learning Fleet Efficiency: Analyzing and Optimizing Large-Scale Google TPU Systems with ML Productivity Goodput](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06982v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen the emergence of machine learning (ML) workloads deployed in warehouse-scale computing (WSC) settings, also known as ML fleets. As the computational demands placed on ML fleets have increased due to the rise of large models and growing demand for ML applications, it has become increasingly critical to measure and improve the efficiency of such systems. However, there is not yet an established methodology to characterize ML fleet performance and identify potential performance optimizations accordingly. This paper presents a large-scale analysis of an ML fleet based on Google's TPUs, introducing a framework to capture fleet-wide efficiency, systematically evaluate performance characteristics, and identify optimization strategies for the fleet. We begin by defining an ML fleet, outlining its components, and analyzing an example Google ML fleet in production comprising thousands of accelerators running diverse workloads. Our study reveals several critical insights: first, ML fleets extend beyond the hardware layer, with model, data, framework, compiler, and scheduling layers significantly impacting performance; second, the heterogeneous nature of ML fleets poses challenges in characterizing individual workload performance; and third, traditional utilization-based metrics prove insufficient for ML fleet characterization. To address these challenges, we present the "ML Productivity Goodput" (MPG) metric to measure ML fleet efficiency. We show how to leverage this metric to characterize the fleet across the ML system stack. We also present methods to identify and optimize performance bottlenecks using MPG, providing strategies for managing warehouse-scale ML systems in general. Lastly, we demonstrate quantitative evaluations from applying these methods to a real ML fleet for internal-facing Google TPU workloads, where we observed tangible improvements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensemble of Large Language Models for Curated Labeling and Rating of Free-text Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08413v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-text responses are commonly collected in psychological studies, providing rich qualitative insights that quantitative measures may not capture. Labeling curated topics of research interest in free-text data by multiple trained human coders is typically labor-intensive and time-consuming. Though large language models (LLMs) excel in language processing, LLM-assisted labeling techniques relying on closed-source LLMs cannot be directly applied to free-text data, without explicit consent for external use. In this study, we propose a framework of assembling locally-deployable LLMs to enhance the labeling of predetermined topics in free-text data under privacy constraints. Analogous to annotation by multiple human raters, this framework leverages the heterogeneity of diverse open-source LLMs. The ensemble approach seeks a balance between the agreement and disagreement across LLMs, guided by a relevancy scoring methodology that utilizes embedding distances between topic descriptions and LLMs' reasoning. We evaluated the ensemble approach using both publicly accessible Reddit data from eating disorder related forums, and free-text responses from eating disorder patients, both complemented by human annotations. We found that: (1) there is heterogeneity in the performance of labeling among same-sized LLMs, with some showing low sensitivity but high precision, while others exhibit high sensitivity but low precision. (2) Compared to individual LLMs, the ensemble of LLMs achieved the highest accuracy and optimal precision-sensitivity trade-off in predicting human annotations. (3) The relevancy scores across LLMs showed greater agreement than dichotomous labels, indicating that the relevancy scoring method effectively mitigates the heterogeneity in LLMs' labeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided and Variance-Corrected Fusion with One-shot Style Alignment for Large-Content Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12771v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Producing large images using small diffusion models is gaining increasing popularity, as the cost of training large models could be prohibitive. A common approach involves jointly generating a series of overlapped image patches and obtaining large images by merging adjacent patches. However, results from existing methods often exhibit noticeable artifacts, e.g., seams and inconsistent objects and styles. To address the issues, we proposed Guided Fusion (GF), which mitigates the negative impact from distant image regions by applying a weighted average to the overlapping regions. Moreover, we proposed Variance-Corrected Fusion (VCF), which corrects data variance at post-averaging, generating more accurate fusion for the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model. Furthermore, we proposed a one-shot Style Alignment (SA), which generates a coherent style for large images by adjusting the initial input noise without adding extra computational burden. Extensive experiments demonstrated that the proposed fusion methods improved the quality of the generated image significantly. The proposed method can be widely applied as a plug-and-play module to enhance other fusion-based methods for large image generation. Code: https://github.com/TitorX/GVCFDiffusion</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Loss-Based Sample Reweighting for Improved Large Language Model Pretraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06733v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretraining large language models (LLMs) on vast and heterogeneous datasets is crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance across diverse downstream tasks. However, current training paradigms treat all samples equally, overlooking the importance or relevance of individual samples throughout the training process. Existing reweighting strategies, which primarily focus on group-level data importance, fail to leverage fine-grained instance-level information and do not adapt dynamically to individual sample importance as training progresses. In this paper, we introduce novel algorithms for dynamic, instance-level data reweighting aimed at improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of LLM pretraining. Our methods adjust the weight of each training sample based on its loss value in an online fashion, allowing the model to dynamically focus on more informative or important samples at the current training stage. In particular, our framework allows us to systematically devise reweighting strategies deprioritizing redundant or uninformative data, which we find tend to work best. Furthermore, we develop a new theoretical framework for analyzing the impact of loss-based reweighting on the convergence of gradient-based optimization, providing the first formal characterization of how these strategies affect convergence bounds. We empirically validate our approach across a spectrum of tasks, from pretraining 7B and 1.4B parameter LLMs to smaller-scale language models and linear regression problems, demonstrating that our loss-based reweighting approach can lead to faster convergence and significantly improved performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ICLR 2025.

Existing privacy-preserving methods often compromise usability and security, limiting their adoption in practical scenarios. This paper introduces a novel, user-centric approach that leverages familiar audio editing techniques, specifically pitch and tempo manipulation, to protect emotional privacy without sacrificing usability. By analyzing popular audio editing applications on Android and iOS platforms, we identified these features as both widely available and usable. We rigorously evaluated their effectiveness against a threat model, considering adversarial attacks from diverse sources, including Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and and reversibility testing. Our experiments, conducted on three distinct datasets, demonstrate that pitch and tempo manipulation effectively obfuscates emotional data. Additionally, we explore the design principles for lightweight, on-device implementation to ensure broad applicability across various devices and platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation(Poster) at PPAI-25: The 6th AAAI Workshop on Privacy-Preserving Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective solution for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection. However, existing methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning, face two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature learning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject variations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing 813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our knowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive pretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation and majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11 EEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised pre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to extract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5 channel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal and channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance, achieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a 9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of our model strongly confirm the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training and channel-aligned unified fine-tuning for addressing inter-subject variation.

While most research focuses on short-term scenarios with minimal appearance changes, real-world applications demand robust Re-ID systems capable of handling long-term scenarios, where persons' appearances can change significantly due to variations in clothing and physical characteristics. In this paper, we present CHIRLA, Comprehensive High-resolution Identification and Re-identification for Large-scale Analysis, a novel dataset specifically designed for long-term person Re-ID. CHIRLA consists of recordings from strategically placed cameras over a seven-month period, capturing significant variations in both temporal and appearance attributes, including controlled changes in participants' clothing and physical features. The dataset includes 22 individuals, four connected indoor environments, and seven cameras. We collected more than five hours of video that we semi-automatically labeled to generate around one million bounding boxes with identity annotations. By introducing this comprehensive benchmark, we aim to facilitate the development and evaluation of Re-ID algorithms that can reliably perform in challenging, long-term real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Self-Efficacy and Performance of Large Language Models via Verbal Efficacy Stimulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06669v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Significant improvements have been observed in the zero-shot capabilities of the Large Language Models (LLMs). Due to their high sensitivity to input, research has increasingly focused on enhancing LLMs' performance via direct and simple prompt engineering rather than intricate domain adaptation. Studies suggest that LLMs exhibit emotional intelligence, and both positive and negative emotions can potentially enhance task performances. However, prior interaction prompts have predominantly concentrated on a single stimulus type, neglecting to compare different stimulus effects, examine the influence of varying task difficulties, or explore underlying mechanisms. This paper, inspired by the positive correlation between self-efficacy and task performance within the social cognitive theory, introduces Verbal Efficacy Stimulations (VES). Our VES comprises three types of verbal prompts: encouraging, provocative, and critical, addressing six aspects such as helpfulness and competence. And we further categorize task difficulty, aiming to extensively investigate how distinct VES influence the self-efficacy and task achievements of language models at varied levels of difficulty. The experimental results show that the three types of VES improve the performance of LLMs on most tasks, and the most effective VES varies for different models. In extensive experiments, we have obtained some findings consistent with psychological theories, providing novel insights for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in ICONIP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Unbiased Evaluation of Large Language Models from a Causal Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06655v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benchmark contamination has become a significant concern in the LLM evaluation community. Previous Agents-as-an-Evaluator address this issue by involving agents in the generation of questions. Despite their success, the biases in Agents-as-an-Evaluator methods remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we present a theoretical formulation of evaluation bias, providing valuable insights into designing unbiased evaluation protocols. Furthermore, we identify two type of bias in Agents-as-an-Evaluator through carefully designed probing tasks on a minimal Agents-as-an-Evaluator setup. To address these issues, we propose the Unbiased Evaluator, an evaluation protocol that delivers a more comprehensive, unbiased, and interpretable assessment of LLMs.Extensive experiments reveal significant room for improvement in current LLMs. Additionally, we demonstrate that the Unbiased Evaluator not only offers strong evidence of benchmark contamination but also provides interpretable evaluation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[TripoSG: High-Fidelity 3D Shape Synthesis using Large-Scale Rectified Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06608v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in diffusion techniques have propelled image and video generation to unprece- dented levels of quality, significantly accelerating the deployment and application of generative AI. However, 3D shape generation technology has so far lagged behind, constrained by limitations in 3D data scale, complexity of 3D data process- ing, and insufficient exploration of advanced tech- niques in the 3D domain. Current approaches to 3D shape generation face substantial challenges in terms of output quality, generalization capa- bility, and alignment with input conditions. We present TripoSG, a new streamlined shape diffu- sion paradigm capable of generating high-fidelity 3D meshes with precise correspondence to input images. Specifically, we propose: 1) A large-scale rectified flow transformer for 3D shape generation, achieving state-of-the-art fidelity through training on extensive, high-quality data. 2) A hybrid supervised training strategy combining SDF, normal, and eikonal losses for 3D VAE, achieving high- quality 3D reconstruction performance. 3) A data processing pipeline to generate 2 million high- quality 3D samples, highlighting the crucial rules for data quality and quantity in training 3D gen- erative models. Through comprehensive experi- ments, we have validated the effectiveness of each component in our new framework. The seamless integration of these parts has enabled TripoSG to achieve state-of-the-art performance in 3D shape generation. The resulting 3D shapes exhibit en- hanced detail due to high-resolution capabilities and demonstrate exceptional fidelity to input im- ages. Moreover, TripoSG demonstrates improved versatility in generating 3D models from diverse image styles and contents, showcasing strong gen- eralization capabilities. To foster progress and innovation in the field of 3D generation, we will make our model publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Hephaestus-Forge, the first large-scale pre-training corpus designed to enhance the fundamental capabilities of LLM agents in API function calling, intrinsic reasoning and planning, and adapting to environmental feedback. Hephaestus-Forge comprises 103B agent-specific data encompassing 76,537 APIs, including both tool documentation to introduce knowledge of API functions and function calling trajectories to strengthen intrinsic reasoning. To explore effective training protocols, we investigate scaling laws to identify the optimal recipe in data mixing ratios. By continual pre-training on Hephaestus-Forge, Hephaestus outperforms small- to medium-scale open-source LLMs and rivals commercial LLMs on three agent benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our pre-training corpus in enhancing fundamental agentic capabilities and generalization of LLMs to new tasks or environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

However, their reliance on massive internet-sourced datasets for training brings notable privacy issues, which are exacerbated in critical domains (e.g., healthcare). Moreover, certain application-specific scenarios may require fine-tuning these models on private data. This survey critically examines the privacy threats associated with LLMs, emphasizing the potential for these models to memorize and inadvertently reveal sensitive information. We explore current threats by reviewing privacy attacks on LLMs and propose comprehensive solutions for integrating privacy mechanisms throughout the entire learning pipeline. These solutions range from anonymizing training datasets to implementing differential privacy during training or inference and machine unlearning after training. Our comprehensive review of existing literature highlights ongoing challenges, available tools, and future directions for preserving privacy in LLMs. This work aims to guide the development of more secure and trustworthy AI systems by providing a thorough understanding of privacy preservation methods and their effectiveness in mitigating risks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR) https://openreview.net/forum?id=Ss9MTTN7OL</p></details> |

Existing benchmarks often rely on extensive human annotation or handcrafted templates, making it difficult to achieve the necessary complexity, scalability, and diversity for robust evaluation. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework called ProverGen that synergizes the generative strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the rigor and precision of symbolic provers, enabling the creation of a scalable, diverse, and high-quality FOL reasoning dataset, ProverQA. ProverQA is also distinguished by its inclusion of accessible and logically coherent intermediate reasoning steps for each problem. Our evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle to solve ProverQA problems, even with CoT prompting, highlighting the dataset's challenging nature. We also finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on a separate training set generated by our framework. The finetuned model demonstrates consistent improvements on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution test sets, suggesting the value of our proposed data generation framework.

Alignment arises as a significant challenge to mitigate hallucinations in the use of LLMs. Ranking LLMs has proven to be an effective tool to improve alignment based on the best-of-$N$ policy. In this paper, we propose a new inferential framework for hypothesis testing among the ranking for language models. Our framework is based on a nonparametric contextual ranking framework designed to assess large language models' domain-specific expertise, leveraging nonparametric scoring methods to account for their sensitivity to the prompts. To characterize the combinatorial complexity of the ranking, we introduce a novel concept of confidence diagram, which leverages a Hasse diagram to represent the entire confidence set of rankings by a single directed graph. We show the validity of the proposed confidence diagram by advancing the Gaussian multiplier bootstrap theory to accommodate the supremum of independent empirical processes that are not necessarily identically distributed. Extensive numerical experiments conducted on both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our approach offers valuable insight into the evaluation for the performance of different LLMs across various medical domains.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents Thought2Text, which uses instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned with EEG data to achieve this goal. The approach involves three stages: (1) training an EEG encoder for visual feature extraction, (2) fine-tuning LLMs on image and text data, enabling multimodal description generation, and (3) further fine-tuning on EEG embeddings to generate text directly from EEG during inference. Experiments on a public EEG dataset collected for six subjects with image stimuli and text captions demonstrate the efficacy of multimodal LLMs (LLaMA-v3, Mistral-v0.3, Qwen2.5), validated using traditional language generation evaluation metrics, as well as fluency and adequacy measures. This approach marks a significant advancement towards portable, low-cost "thoughts-to-text" technology with potential applications in both neuroscience and natural language processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of NAACL 2025</p></details> |

However, the high storage and computational cost of LLMs has become a challenge for deploying LLMs. Weight quantization has been widely used for model compression, which can reduce both storage and computational cost. Most existing weight quantization methods for LLMs use a rank-one codebook for quantization, which results in substantial accuracy loss when the compression ratio is high. In this paper, we propose a novel weight quantization method, called low-rank codebook based quantization~(LCQ), for LLMs. LCQ adopts a low-rank codebook, the rank of which can be larger than one, for quantization. Experiments show that LCQ can achieve better accuracy than existing methods with a negligibly extra storage cost.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

This capability is particularly significant in specialized domains such as biomedicine, where it can support automatic evidence interpretation and scientific discovery. This paper presents SylloBio-NLI, a novel framework that leverages external ontologies to systematically instantiate diverse syllogistic arguments for biomedical NLI. We employ SylloBio-NLI to evaluate Large Language Models (LLMs) on identifying valid conclusions and extracting supporting evidence across 28 syllogistic schemes instantiated with human genome pathways. Extensive experiments reveal that biomedical syllogistic reasoning is particularly challenging for zero-shot LLMs, which achieve an average accuracy between 70% on generalized modus ponens and 23% on disjunctive syllogism. At the same time, we found that few-shot prompting can boost the performance of different LLMs, including Gemma (+14%) and LLama-3 (+43%). However, a deeper analysis shows that both techniques exhibit high sensitivity to superficial lexical variations, highlighting a dependency between reliability, models' architecture, and pre-training regime. Overall, our results indicate that, while in-context examples have the potential to elicit syllogistic reasoning in LLMs, existing models are still far from achieving the robustness and consistency required for safe biomedical NLI applications.</p></details> |  |

This study focuses on enhancing psychiatric interviews by analyzing counseling data from North Korean defectors who have experienced trauma and mental health issues. Objective: The study investigates whether LLMs can (1) identify parts of conversations that suggest psychiatric symptoms and recognize those symptoms, and (2) summarize stressors and symptoms based on interview transcripts. Methods: LLMs are tasked with (1) extracting stressors from transcripts, (2) identifying symptoms and their corresponding sections, and (3) generating interview summaries using the extracted data. The transcripts were labeled by mental health experts for training and evaluation. Results: In the zero-shot inference setting using GPT-4 Turbo, 73 out of 102 segments demonstrated a recall mid-token distance d < 20 in identifying symptom-related sections. For recognizing specific symptoms, fine-tuning outperformed zero-shot inference, achieving an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.82. For the generative summarization task, LLMs using symptom and stressor information scored highly on G-Eval metrics: coherence (4.66), consistency (4.73), fluency (2.16), and relevance (4.67). Retrieval-augmented generation showed no notable performance improvement. Conclusions: LLMs, with fine-tuning or appropriate prompting, demonstrated strong accuracy (over 0.8) for symptom delineation and achieved high coherence (4.6+) in summarization. This study highlights their potential to assist mental health practitioners in analyzing psychiatric interviews.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Large-scale Dataset Compression: Shifting Focus From Labels to Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06434v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation and dataset pruning are two prominent techniques for compressing datasets to improve computational and storage efficiency. Despite their overlapping objectives, these approaches are rarely compared directly. Even within each field, the evaluation protocols are inconsistent across various methods, which complicates fair comparisons and hinders reproducibility. Considering these limitations, we introduce in this paper a benchmark that equitably evaluates methodologies across both distillation and pruning literatures. Notably, our benchmark reveals that in the mainstream dataset distillation setting for large-scale datasets, which heavily rely on soft labels from pre-trained models, even randomly selected subsets can achieve surprisingly competitive performance. This finding suggests that an overemphasis on soft labels may be diverting attention from the intrinsic value of the image data, while also imposing additional burdens in terms of generation, storage, and application. To address these issues, we propose a new framework for dataset compression, termed Prune, Combine, and Augment (PCA), which focuses on leveraging image data exclusively, relies solely on hard labels for evaluation, and achieves state-of-the-art performance in this setup. By shifting the emphasis back to the images, our benchmark and PCA framework pave the way for more balanced and accessible techniques in dataset compression research.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue by updating only a small subset of model parameters using adapter modules. In this work, we propose \emph{Quantum-Inspired Adapters}, a PEFT approach inspired by Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits from quantum machine learning literature. These models can be both expressive and parameter-efficient by operating in a combinatorially large space while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in weight parameters. We test our proposed adapters by adapting large language models and large vision transformers on benchmark datasets. Our method can achieve 99.2\% of the performance of existing fine-tuning methods such LoRA with a 44x parameter compression on language understanding datasets like GLUE and VTAB. Compared to existing orthogonal fine-tuning methods such as OFT or BOFT, we achieve 98\% relative performance with 25x fewer parameters. This demonstrates competitive performance paired with a significant reduction in trainable parameters. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that Quantum-Inspired Adapters offer a promising direction for efficient adaptation of language and vision models in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

This study presents the first Occupancy-based Large Language Model (Occ-LLM), which represents a pioneering effort to integrate LLMs with an important representation. To effectively encode occupancy as input for the LLM and address the category imbalances associated with occupancy, we propose Motion Separation Variational Autoencoder (MS-VAE). This innovative approach utilizes prior knowledge to distinguish dynamic objects from static scenes before inputting them into a tailored Variational Autoencoder (VAE). This separation enhances the model's capacity to concentrate on dynamic trajectories while effectively reconstructing static scenes. The efficacy of Occ-LLM has been validated across key tasks, including 4D occupancy forecasting, self-ego planning, and occupancy-based scene question answering. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Occ-LLM significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art methodologies, achieving gains of about 6\% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 4\% in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for the task of 4D occupancy forecasting.

| **[Systematic Outliers in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06415v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Outliers have been widely observed in Large Language Models (LLMs), significantly impacting model performance and posing challenges for model compression. Understanding the functionality and formation mechanisms of these outliers is critically important. Existing works, however, largely focus on reducing the impact of outliers from an algorithmic perspective, lacking an in-depth investigation into their causes and roles. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the formation process, underlying causes, and functions of outliers in LLMs. We define and categorize three types of outliers-activation outliers, weight outliers, and attention outliers-and analyze their distributions across different dimensions, uncovering inherent connections between their occurrences and their ultimate influence on the attention mechanism. Based on these observations, we hypothesize and explore the mechanisms by which these outliers arise and function, demonstrating through theoretical derivations and experiments that they emerge due to the self-attention mechanism's softmax operation. These outliers act as implicit context-aware scaling factors within the attention mechanism. As these outliers stem from systematic influences, we term them systematic outliers. Our study not only enhances the understanding of Transformer-based LLMs but also shows that structurally eliminating outliers can accelerate convergence and improve model compression.

| **[Factor Modelling for Biclustering Large-dimensional Matrix-valued Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06397v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel unsupervised learning method is proposed in this paper for biclustering large-dimensional matrix-valued time series based on an entirely new latent two-way factor structure. Each block cluster is characterized by its own row and column cluster-specific factors in addition to some common matrix factors which impact on all the matrix time series. We first estimate the global loading spaces by projecting the observation matrices onto the row or column loading space corresponding to common factors. The loading spaces for cluster-specific factors are then further recovered by projecting the observation matrices onto the orthogonal complement space of the estimated global loading spaces. To identify the latent row/column clusters simultaneously for matrix-valued time series, we provide a $K$-means algorithm based on the estimated row/column factor loadings of the cluster-specific weak factors. Theoretically, we derive faster convergence rates for global loading matrices than those of the state-of-the-art methods available in the literature under mild conditions. We also propose an one-pass eigenvalue-ratio method to estimate the numbers of global and cluster-specific factors. The consistency with explicit convergence rates is also established for the estimators of the local loading matrices, the factor numbers and the latent cluster memberships. Numerical experiments with both simulated data as well as a real data example are also reported to illustrate the usefulness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive gradient algorithms like Adam, AdamW, and their variants have been central to this task. Despite the development of numerous variance reduction algorithms in the past decade aimed at accelerating stochastic optimization in both convex and nonconvex settings, variance reduction has not found widespread success in training deep neural networks or large language models. Consequently, it has remained a less favored approach in modern AI. In this paper, to unleash the power of variance reduction for efficient training of large models, we propose a unified optimization framework, MARS (Make vAriance Reduction Shine), which reconciles preconditioned gradient methods with variance reduction via a scaled stochastic recursive momentum technique. Within our framework, we introduce three instances of MARS that leverage preconditioned gradient updates based on AdamW, Lion, and Shampoo, respectively. We also draw a connection between our algorithms and existing optimizers. Experimental results on training GPT-2 models indicate that MARS consistently outperforms AdamW by a large margin. The implementation of MARS is available at https://github.com/AGI-Arena/MARS.</p></details> | <details><summary>47 pa...</summary><p>47 pages, 18 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

In ophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4 million natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high adaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a general-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown promise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations by fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight standardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and the UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting diabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets, all P<=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P<0.001). In glaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940, P<0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2 models in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke (AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P<0.001). These trends persisted even with 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct scenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the importance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise clinical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[DebateBench: A Challenging Long Context Reasoning Benchmark For Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06279v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DebateBench, a novel dataset consisting of an extensive collection of transcripts and metadata from some of the world's most prestigious competitive debates. The dataset consists of British Parliamentary debates from prestigious debating tournaments on diverse topics, annotated with detailed speech-level scores and house rankings sourced from official adjudication data. We curate 256 speeches across 32 debates with each debate being over 1 hour long with each input being an average of 32,000 tokens. Designed to capture long-context, large-scale reasoning tasks, DebateBench provides a benchmark for evaluating modern large language models (LLMs) on their ability to engage in argumentation, deliberation, and alignment with human experts. To do well on DebateBench, the LLMs must perform in-context learning to understand the rules and evaluation criteria of the debates, then analyze 8 seven minute long speeches and reason about the arguments presented by all speakers to give the final results. Our preliminary evaluation using GPT o1, GPT-4o, and Claude Haiku, shows that LLMs struggle to perform well on DebateBench, highlighting the need to develop more sophisticated techniques for improving their performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[K-ON: Stacking Knowledge On the Head Layer of Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06257v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Typically, LLMs are trained to predict the next token, aligning well with many NLP tasks. However, in knowledge graph (KG) scenarios, entities are the fundamental units and identifying an entity requires at least several tokens. This leads to a granularity mismatch between KGs and natural languages. To address this issue, we propose K-ON, which integrates KG knowledge into the LLM by employing multiple head layers for next k-step prediction. K-ON can not only generate entity-level results in one step, but also enables contrastive loss against entities, which is the most powerful tool in KG representation learning. Experimental results show that K-ON outperforms state-of-the-art methods that incorporate text and even the other modalities.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 (Oral) |

As these systems have scaled, such issues have persisted. Currently, large language models (LLMs) with billions of parameters suffer from adversarial attacks just like their earlier, smaller counterparts. However, the threat models have changed. Previously, having gray-box access, where input embeddings or output logits/probabilities were visible to the user, might have been reasonable. However, with the introduction of closed-source models, no information about the model is available apart from the generated output. This means that current black-box attacks can only utilize the final prediction to detect if an attack is successful. In this work, we investigate and demonstrate the potential of attack guidance, akin to using output probabilities, while having only black-box access in a classification setting. This is achieved through the ability to elicit confidence from the model. We empirically show that the elicited confidence is calibrated and not hallucinated for current LLMs. By minimizing the elicited confidence, we can therefore increase the likelihood of misclassification. Our new proposed paradigm demonstrates promising state-of-the-art results on three datasets across two models (LLaMA-3-8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct-V0.3) when comparing our technique to existing hard-label black-box attack methods that introduce word-level substitutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ICLR 2025.

| **[Uncertainty-Aware Adaptation of Large Language Models for Protein-Protein Interaction Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06173v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identification of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) helps derive cellular mechanistic understanding, particularly in the context of complex conditions such as neurodegenerative disorders, metabolic syndromes, and cancer. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in predicting protein structures and interactions via automated mining of vast biomedical literature; yet their inherent uncertainty remains a key challenge for deriving reproducible findings, critical for biomedical applications. In this study, we present an uncertainty-aware adaptation of LLMs for PPI analysis, leveraging fine-tuned LLaMA-3 and BioMedGPT models. To enhance prediction reliability, we integrate LoRA ensembles and Bayesian LoRA models for uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring confidence-calibrated insights into protein behavior. Our approach achieves competitive performance in PPI identification across diverse disease contexts while addressing model uncertainty, thereby enhancing trustworthiness and reproducibility in computational biology. These findings underscore the potential of uncertainty-aware LLM adaptation for advancing precision medicine and biomedical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[LemmaHead: RAG Assisted Proof Generation Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15797v4)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing the logic necessary to solve mathematical problems or write mathematical proofs is one of the more difficult objectives for large language models (LLMS). Currently, the most popular methods in literature consists of fine-tuning the model on written mathematical content such as academic publications and textbooks, so that the model can learn to emulate the style of mathematical writing. In this project, we explore the effectiveness of using retrieval augmented generation (RAG) to address gaps in the mathematical reasoning of LLMs. We develop LemmaHead, a RAG knowledge base that supplements queries to the model with relevant mathematical context, with particular focus on context from published textbooks. To measure our model's performance in mathematical reasoning, our testing paradigm focuses on the task of automated theorem proving via generating proofs to a given mathematical claim in the Lean formal language.</p></details> |  |

All current practical methods for this problem have runtimes at least $\Omega(k^2)$. We find that initialization routines are not a bottleneck for this case. Instead, it is critical to improve the speed of Lloyd's local-search algorithm, particularly the step that reassigns points to their closest center. Attempting to improve this step naturally leads us to leverage approximate nearest-neighbor search methods, although this alone is not enough to be practical. Instead, we propose a family of problems we call "Seeded Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search", for which we propose "Seeded Search-Graph" methods as a solution.</p></details> | 29 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DReSS: Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17905v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress across various domains, but their increasing scale results in high computational and memory costs. Recent studies have revealed that LLMs exhibit sparsity, providing the potential to reduce model size through pruning techniques. However, existing pruning methods typically follow a prune-then-finetune paradigm. Since the pruned components still contain valuable information, their direct removal often leads to irreversible performance degradation, imposing a substantial computational burden to recover performance during finetuning. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that first applies regularization, then prunes, and finally finetunes. Based on this paradigm, we introduce DReSS, a simple and effective Data-driven Regularized Structured Streamlining method for LLMs. By leveraging a small amount of data to regularize the components to be pruned, DReSS explicitly transfers the important information to the remaining parts of the model in advance. Compared to direct pruning, this can reduce the information loss caused by parameter removal, thereby enhancing its language modeling capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate that DReSS significantly outperforms existing pruning methods even under extreme pruning ratios, significantly reducing latency and increasing throughput.</p></details> |  |

In this work, inspired by the observation that the text-to-image generation process is the inverse of image-conditioned response generation in LVLMs, we explore the potential of leveraging text-to-image generative models to assist in mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. We discover that generative models can offer valuable self-feedback for mitigating hallucinations at both the response and token levels. Building on this insight, we introduce self-correcting Decoding with Generative Feedback (DeGF), a novel training-free algorithm that incorporates feedback from text-to-image generative models into the decoding process to effectively mitigate hallucinations in LVLMs. Specifically, DeGF generates an image from the initial response produced by LVLMs, which acts as an auxiliary visual reference and provides self-feedback to verify and correct the initial response through complementary or contrastive decoding. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating diverse types of hallucinations, consistently surpassing state-of-the-art methods across six benchmarks.

| **[Accessing Vision Foundation Models via ImageNet-1K](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10366v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models are renowned for the generalization ability due to massive training data. Nevertheless, they demand tremendous training resources, and the training data is often inaccessible, e.g., CLIP, DINOv2, posing great challenges to developing derivatives that could facilitate the research. In this work, we offer a very simple and general solution, named \textit{Proteus}, to distill foundation models into smaller equivalents on ImageNet-1K without access to the original training data. Specifically, we remove the designs from conventional knowledge distillation settings that result in dataset bias and present three levels of training objectives, i.e., token, patch, and feature, to maximize the efficacy of knowledge transfer. In this manner, Proteus is trained at ImageNet-level costs with surprising ability, facilitating the accessibility of training foundation models for the broader research community. When leveraging DINOv2-g/14 as the teacher, Proteus-L/14 matches the performance of the Oracle method DINOv2-L/14 (142M training data) across 19 benchmarks and outperforms other vision foundation models including CLIP-L/14 (400M), OpenCLIP-L/14 (400M/2B) and SynCLR-L/14 (600M) with a significantly smaller training set of 1.2M images.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2025 |

Most of these systems are developed with modular sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be hand-engineered or learning-based. While these approaches perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for, they can perform especially poorly in out-of-distribution scenarios that will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on multiple tasks with impressively large datasets has led researchers to believe that these models may provide "common sense" reasoning that existing planners are missing, bridging the gap between algorithm development and deployment. While researchers have shown promising results in deploying foundation models to decision-making tasks, these models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may sound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's decision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision problems, present guidelines, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Computing Surveys; 55 pages, 5 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

By extracting known concepts (e.g., Golden-Gate Bridge) from human-interpretable data (e.g., text), sparse DL can elucidate a model's inner workings. In this work, we ask if DL can also be used to discover unknown concepts from less human-interpretable scientific data (e.g., cell images), ultimately enabling modern approaches to scientific discovery. As a first step, we use DL algorithms to study microscopy foundation models trained on multi-cell image data, where little prior knowledge exists regarding which high-level concepts should arise. We show that sparse dictionaries indeed extract biologically-meaningful concepts such as cell type and genetic perturbation type. We also propose Iterative Codebook Feature Learning~(ICFL) and combine it with a pre-processing step which uses PCA whitening from a control dataset. In our experiments, we demonstrate that both ICFL and PCA improve the selectivity of extracted features compared to TopK sparse autoencoders.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at CHIL 2025</p></details> |

While existing benchmarks evaluate FM-based UI navigation using the binary pass/fail metric, they have two major limitations: they cannot reflect the complex nature of mobile UI navigation where FMs may fail for various reasons (e.g., misunderstanding instructions and failed planning), and they lack industrial relevance due to oversimplified tasks that poorly represent real-world scenarios. To address the preceding limitations, we propose Sphinx, a comprehensive benchmark for multi-dimensional evaluation of FMs in industrial settings of UI navigation. Sphinx introduces a specialized toolkit that evaluates five essential FM capabilities, providing detailed insights into failure modes such as insufficient app knowledge or planning issues. Using both popular Google Play applications and WeChat's internal UI test cases, we evaluate 8 FMs with 20 different configurations. Our results show that existing FMs universally struggle with goal-based testing tasks, primarily due to insufficient UI-specific capabilities. We summarize seven lessons learned from benchmarking FMs with Sphinx, providing clear directions for improving FM-based mobile UI navigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Few-Shot Defect Segmentation in General Industrial Scenarios with Metric Learning and Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01216v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial defect segmentation is critical for manufacturing quality control. Due to the scarcity of training defect samples, few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) holds significant value in this field. However, existing studies mostly apply FSS to tackle defects on simple textures, without considering more diverse scenarios. This paper aims to address this gap by exploring FSS in broader industrial products with various defect types. To this end, we contribute a new real-world dataset and reorganize some existing datasets to build a more comprehensive few-shot defect segmentation (FDS) benchmark. On this benchmark, we thoroughly investigate metric learning-based FSS methods, including those based on meta-learning and those based on Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). We observe that existing meta-learning-based methods are generally not well-suited for this task, while VFMs hold great potential. We further systematically study the applicability of various VFMs in this task, involving two paradigms: feature matching and the use of Segment Anything (SAM) models. We propose a novel efficient FDS method based on feature matching. Meanwhile, we find that SAM2 is particularly effective for addressing FDS through its video track mode. The contributed dataset and code will be available at: https://github.com/liutongkun/GFDS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Foundation Model for Physics-Informed Neural Networks: Multi-PDE Learning with Active Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07425v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) by embedding physical laws into neural network training. However, traditional PINN models are typically designed for single PDEs, limiting their generalizability across different physical systems. In this work, we explore the potential of a foundation PINN model capable of solving multiple PDEs within a unified architecture. We investigate the efficacy of a single PINN framework trained on four distinct PDEs-the Simple Harmonic Oscillator (SHO), the 1D Heat Equation, the 1D Wave Equation, and the 2D Laplace Equation, demonstrating its ability to learn diverse physical dynamics. To enhance sample efficiency, we incorporate Active Learning (AL) using Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout-based uncertainty estimation, selecting the most informative training samples iteratively. We evaluate different active learning strategies, comparing models trained on 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, and 50% of the full dataset, and analyze their impact on solution accuracy. Our results indicate that targeted uncertainty sampling significantly improves performance with fewer training samples, leading to efficient learning across multiple PDEs. This work highlights the feasibility of a generalizable PINN-based foundation model, capable of adapting to different physics-based problems without redesigning network architectures. Our findings suggest that multi-PDE PINNs with active learning can serve as an effective approach for reducing computational costs while maintaining high accuracy in physics-based deep learning applications.</p></details> |  |

While significant progress has been made in robotic manipulation, existing approaches often fall short in generalization to complex environmental variations and addressing memory-dependent tasks. To bridge this gap, we introduce SAM2Act, a multi-view robotic transformer-based policy that leverages multi-resolution upsampling with visual representations from large-scale foundation model. SAM2Act achieves a state-of-the-art average success rate of 86.8% across 18 tasks in the RLBench benchmark, and demonstrates robust generalization on The Colosseum benchmark, with only a 4.3% performance gap under diverse environmental perturbations. Building on this foundation, we propose SAM2Act+, a memory-based architecture inspired by SAM2, which incorporates a memory bank, an encoder, and an attention mechanism to enhance spatial memory. To address the need for evaluating memory-dependent tasks, we introduce MemoryBench, a novel benchmark designed to assess spatial memory and action recall in robotic manipulation. SAM2Act+ achieves competitive performance on MemoryBench, significantly outperforming existing approaches and pushing the boundaries of memory-enabled robotic systems.

This concept, known as Coarse Ethics (CE), has primarily been discussed in natural language without a formal mathematical foundation. This paper introduces Coarse Set Theory (CST) to establish a mathematical framework for CE. We define coarse sets using totally ordered sets and propose axioms that characterize the hierarchical relationships between elements and their groupings. Additionally, we introduce coarse-grained sets, which partition an underlying set into equivalence classes based on predefined criteria. We extend this framework by defining coarse mappings, which transform detailed individual data into coarser representations while maintaining essential structural properties. To measure the information loss, we employ Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, demonstrating how different coarse partitions affect the preservation of information. We illustrate how CST can be applied to real-world grading systems through theoretical formulations and empirical analysis. This study provides a rigorous foundation for CE, enabling a more systematic exploration of fairness, interpretability, and decision-making trade-offs.</p></details> | 31 pages, 2 figures |
| **[GENERator: A Long-Context Generative Genomic Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07272v1)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in DNA sequencing technologies have significantly improved our ability to decode genomic sequences. However, the prediction and interpretation of these sequences remain challenging due to the intricate nature of genetic material. Large language models (LLMs) have introduced new opportunities for biological sequence analysis. Recent developments in genomic language models have underscored the potential of LLMs in deciphering DNA sequences. Nonetheless, existing models often face limitations in robustness and application scope, primarily due to constraints in model structure and training data scale. To address these limitations, we present GENERator, a generative genomic foundation model featuring a context length of 98k base pairs (bp) and 1.2B parameters. Trained on an expansive dataset comprising 386B bp of eukaryotic DNA, the GENERator demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across both established and newly proposed benchmarks. The model adheres to the central dogma of molecular biology, accurately generating protein-coding sequences that translate into proteins structurally analogous to known families. It also shows significant promise in sequence optimization, particularly through the prompt-responsive generation of promoter sequences with specific activity profiles. These capabilities position the GENERator as a pivotal tool for genomic research and biotechnological advancement, enhancing our ability to interpret and predict complex biological systems and enabling precise genomic interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[TimeDiT: General-purpose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02322v2)** | 2025-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have revolutionized text and video processing, yet time series data presents distinct challenges for such approaches due to domain-specific features such as missing values, multi-resolution characteristics, etc. Furthermore, the de-facto autoregressive transformers tend to learn deterministic temporal dependencies within pre-trained data while overlooking inherent uncertainties and lacking integration of physical constraints. In this paper, we introduce TimeDiT, a diffusion transformer model that synergistically combines transformer-based temporal dependency learning with diffusion-based probabilistic sampling. TimeDiT employs a unified masking mechanism to harmonize the training and inference process across diverse tasks while introducing a theoretically grounded, finetuning-free model editing strategy that enables flexible integration of external knowledge during sampling.

| **[LEAD: Large Foundation Model for EEG-Based Alzheimer's Disease Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01678v2)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a non-invasive, highly accessible, and cost-effective solution for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) detection. However, existing methods, whether based on manual feature extraction or deep learning, face two major challenges: the lack of large-scale datasets for robust feature learning and evaluation, and poor detection performance due to inter-subject variations. To address these challenges, we curate an EEG-AD corpus containing 813 subjects, which forms the world's largest EEG-AD dataset to the best of our knowledge. Using this unique dataset, we propose LEAD, the first large foundation model for EEG-based AD detection. Our method encompasses an entire pipeline, from data selection and preprocessing to self-supervised contrastive pretraining, fine-tuning, and key setups such as subject-independent evaluation and majority voting for subject-level detection. We pre-train the model on 11 EEG datasets and unified fine-tune it on 5 AD datasets. Our self-supervised pre-training design includes sample-level and subject-level contrasting to extract useful general EEG features. Fine-tuning is performed on 5 channel-aligned datasets together. The backbone encoder incorporates temporal and channel embeddings to capture features across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Our method demonstrates outstanding AD detection performance, achieving up to a 9.86% increase in F1 score at the sample-level and up to a 9.31% at the subject-level compared to state-of-the-art methods. The results of our model strongly confirm the effectiveness of contrastive pre-training and channel-aligned unified fine-tuning for addressing inter-subject variation.

Robust EEG analytics have the potential to greatly improve patient care. However, traditional deep learning models, especially Transformer-based architectures, are hindered by their quadratic time and memory complexity, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we present FEMBA (Foundational EEG Mamba + Bidirectional Architecture), a novel self-supervised framework that establishes new efficiency benchmarks for EEG analysis through bidirectional state-space modeling. Unlike Transformer-based models, which incur quadratic time and memory complexity, FEMBA scales linearly with sequence length, enabling more scalable and efficient processing of extended EEG recordings. Trained on over 21,000 hours of unlabeled EEG and fine-tuned on three downstream tasks, FEMBA achieves competitive performance in comparison with transformer models, with significantly lower computational cost. Specifically, it reaches 81.82% balanced accuracy (0.8921 AUROC) on TUAB and 0.949 AUROC on TUAR, while a tiny 7.8M-parameter variant demonstrates viability for resource-constrained devices. These results pave the way for scalable, general-purpose EEG analytics in both clinical and highlight FEMBA as a promising candidate for wearable applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, pre-print</p></details> |
| **[Hyper Compressed Fine-Tuning of Large Foundation Models with Quantum Inspired Adapters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06916v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning pre-trained large foundation models for specific tasks has become increasingly challenging due to the computational and storage demands associated with full parameter updates. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods address this issue by updating only a small subset of model parameters using adapter modules. In this work, we propose \emph{Quantum-Inspired Adapters}, a PEFT approach inspired by Hamming-weight preserving quantum circuits from quantum machine learning literature. These models can be both expressive and parameter-efficient by operating in a combinatorially large space while simultaneously preserving orthogonality in weight parameters. We test our proposed adapters by adapting large language models and large vision transformers on benchmark datasets. Our method can achieve 99.2\% of the performance of existing fine-tuning methods such LoRA with a 44x parameter compression on language understanding datasets like GLUE and VTAB. Compared to existing orthogonal fine-tuning methods such as OFT or BOFT, we achieve 98\% relative performance with 25x fewer parameters. This demonstrates competitive performance paired with a significant reduction in trainable parameters. Through ablation studies, we determine that combining multiple Hamming-weight orders with orthogonality and matrix compounding are essential for performant fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that Quantum-Inspired Adapters offer a promising direction for efficient adaptation of language and vision models in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In ophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4 million natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high adaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a general-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown promise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks remains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations by fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular disease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight standardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and the UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting diabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets, all P<=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P<0.001). In glaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940, P<0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2 models in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke (AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P<0.001). These trends persisted even with 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct scenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the importance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise clinical performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Exploiting Vision Foundation Model's Profound Prior Knowledge for Generalizable RGB-Depth Driving Scene Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06219v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision foundation models (VFMs), typically based on Vision Transformer (ViT), have significantly advanced numerous computer vision tasks. Despite their success in tasks focused solely on RGB images, the potential of VFMs in RGB-depth driving scene parsing remains largely under-explored. In this article, we take one step toward this emerging research area by investigating a feasible technique to fully exploit VFMs for generalizable RGB-depth driving scene parsing. Specifically, we explore the inherent characteristics of RGB and depth data, thereby presenting a Heterogeneous Feature Integration Transformer (HFIT). This network enables the efficient extraction and integration of comprehensive heterogeneous features without re-training ViTs. Relative depth prediction results from VFMs, used as inputs to the HFIT side adapter, overcome the limitations of the dependence on depth maps. Our proposed HFIT demonstrates superior performance compared to all other traditional single-modal and data-fusion scene parsing networks, pre-trained VFMs, and ViT adapters on the Cityscapes and KITTI Semantics datasets. We believe this novel strategy paves the way for future innovations in VFM-based data-fusion techniques for driving scene parsing. Our source code is publicly available at https://mias.group/HFIT.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Here we present PASTA, a pan-tumor CT foundation model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on 45 of 46 representative oncology tasks -- including lesion segmentation, tumor detection in plain CT, tumor staging, survival prediction, structured report generation, and cross-modality transfer learning, significantly outperforming the second-best models on 35 tasks. This remarkable advancement is driven by our development of PASTA-Gen, an innovative synthetic tumor generation framework that produces a comprehensive dataset of 30,000 CT scans with pixel-level annotated lesions and paired structured reports, encompassing malignancies across ten organs and five benign lesion types. By leveraging this rich, high-quality synthetic data, we overcome a longstanding bottleneck in the development of CT foundation models -- specifically, the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality annotated datasets due to privacy constraints and the substantial labor required for scaling precise data annotation. Encouragingly, PASTA demonstrates exceptional data efficiency with promising practical value, markedly improving performance on various tasks with only a small amount of real-world data. The open release of both the synthetic dataset and PASTA foundation model effectively addresses the challenge of data scarcity, thereby advancing oncological research and clinical translation.</p></details> | 57 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Foundation Models for Anomaly Detection: Vision and Challenges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06911v1)** | 2025-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As data continues to grow in volume and complexity across domains such as finance, manufacturing, and healthcare, effective anomaly detection is essential for identifying irregular patterns that may signal critical issues. Recently, foundation models (FMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for advancing anomaly detection. They have demonstrated unprecedented capabilities in enhancing anomaly identification, generating detailed data descriptions, and providing visual explanations. This survey presents the first comprehensive review of recent advancements in FM-based anomaly detection. We propose a novel taxonomy that classifies FMs into three categories based on their roles in anomaly detection tasks, i.e., as encoders, detectors, or interpreters. We provide a systematic analysis of state-of-the-art methods and discuss key challenges in leveraging FMs for improved anomaly detection. We also outline future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Investigating Compositional Reasoning in Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06037v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained time series foundation models (TSFMs) have demonstrated promising zero-shot performance across a wide range of domains. However, a question remains: Do TSFMs succeed solely by memorizing training patterns, or do they possess the ability to reason? While reasoning is a topic of great interest in the study of Large Language Models (LLMs), it is undefined and largely unexplored in the context of TSFMs. In this work, inspired by language modeling literature, we formally define compositional reasoning in forecasting and distinguish it from in-distribution generalization. We evaluate the reasoning and generalization capabilities of 23 popular deep learning forecasting models on multiple synthetic and real-world datasets. Additionally, through controlled studies, we systematically examine which design choices in TSFMs contribute to improved reasoning abilities. Our study yields key insights into the impact of TSFM architecture design on compositional reasoning and generalization. We find that patch-based Transformers have the best reasoning performance, closely followed by residualized MLP-based architectures, which are 97\% less computationally complex in terms of FLOPs and 86\% smaller in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Interestingly, in some zero-shot out-of-distribution scenarios, these models can outperform moving average and exponential smoothing statistical baselines trained on in-distribution data. Only a few design choices, such as the tokenization method, had a significant (negative) impact on Transformer model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimodal PDE Foundation Model for Prediction and Scientific Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06026v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks are one tool for approximating non-linear differential equations used in scientific computing tasks such as surrogate modeling, real-time predictions, and optimal control. PDE foundation models utilize neural networks to train approximations to multiple differential equations simultaneously and are thus a general purpose solver that can be adapted to downstream tasks. Current PDE foundation models focus on either learning general solution operators and/or the governing system of equations, and thus only handle numerical or symbolic modalities. However, real-world applications may require more flexible data modalities, e.g. text analysis or descriptive outputs. To address this gap, we propose a novel multimodal deep learning approach that leverages a transformer-based architecture to approximate solution operators for a wide variety of ODEs and PDEs. Our method integrates numerical inputs, such as equation parameters and initial conditions, with text descriptions of physical processes or system dynamics. This enables our model to handle settings where symbolic representations may be incomplete or unavailable. In addition to providing accurate numerical predictions, our approach generates interpretable scientific text descriptions, offering deeper insights into the underlying dynamics and solution properties. The numerical experiments show that our model provides accurate solutions for in-distribution data (with average relative error less than 3.3%) and out-of-distribution data (average relative error less than 7.8%) together with precise text descriptions (with correct descriptions generated 100% of times). In certain tests, the model is also shown to be capable of extrapolating solutions in time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Critical Mathematical Economics and the Model-theoretic Foundations of Controversies in Economic Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06015v1)** | 2025-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aim of this article is to present elements and discuss the potential of a research program at the intersection between mathematics and heterodox economics, which we call Criticial Mathematical Economics (CME). We propose to focus on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and aim at providing an entrance to the literature and an invitation to mathematicians that are potentially interested in such a project. From our point of view, mathematics has been partly misused in mainstream economics to justify `unregulated markets' before the financial crisis. We thus identify two key parts of CME, which leads to a natural structure of this article: The frst focusses on an analysis and critique of mathematical models used in mainstream economics, like e.g. the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) in Macroeconomics and the so-called "Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu"-Theorems. The aim of the second part is to improve and extend heterodox models using ingredients from modern mathematics and computer science, a method with strong relation to Complexity Economics. We exemplify this idea by describing how methods from Non-Linear Dynamics have been used in what could be called "The Dynamical Systems approach to Post-Keynesian Macroeconomics", and also discuss (Pseudo-) Goodwin cycles and possible Micro- and Mesofoundations. We conclude by giving an outlook in which areas a collaboration between mathematicians and heterodox economists could be most promising. The focus lies on the mathematical and model-theoretic foundations of controversies in economic policy, and we discuss both existing projects in such a direction as well as areas where new models for policy advice are most needed from the perspective of the progressive political left.</p></details> | 16 pages |

This strategy enables the efficient creation of robust models, combining the strengths of individual teachers while significantly reducing computational and resource demands. In this paper, we thoroughly analyze state-of-the-art agglomerative models, identifying critical challenges including resolution mode shifts, teacher imbalance, idiosyncratic teacher artifacts, and an excessive number of output tokens. To address these issues, we propose several novel solutions: multi-resolution training, mosaic augmentation, and improved balancing of teacher loss functions. Specifically, in the context of Vision Language Models, we introduce a token compression technique to maintain high-resolution information within a fixed token count. We release our top-performing variants at multiple scales (-B, -L, -H, and -g), along with inference code and pretrained weights</p></details> |  |

Recently, speech foundation models (SFMs) have shown remarkable generalization capabilities across various speech-related tasks. Building on this progress, we propose an audio-visual representation learning model that leverages cross-modal knowledge distillation from SFMs. In our method, SFMs serve as teachers, from which multi-layer hidden representations are extracted using clean audio inputs. We also introduce a multi-teacher ensemble method to distill the student, which receives audio-visual data as inputs. A novel representational knowledge distillation loss is employed to train the student during pretraining, which is also applied during finetuning to further enhance the performance on downstream tasks. Our experiments utilized both a self-supervised SFM, WavLM, and a supervised SFM, iFLYTEK-speech. The results demonstrated that our proposed method achieved superior or at least comparable performance to previous state-of-the-art baselines across automatic speech recognition, visual speech recognition, and audio-visual speech recognition tasks. Additionally, comprehensive ablation studies and the visualization of learned representations were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

While the very recent TabPFNv2 foundation model (2025) excels on tables with up to 10K samples, its alternating column- and row-wise attentions make handling large training sets computationally prohibitive. So, can ICL be effectively scaled and deliver a benefit for larger tables? We introduce TabICL, a tabular foundation model for classification, pretrained on synthetic datasets with up to 60K samples and capable of handling 500K samples on affordable resources. This is enabled by a novel two-stage architecture: a column-then-row attention mechanism to build fixed-dimensional embeddings of rows, followed by a transformer for efficient ICL. Across 200 classification datasets from the TALENT benchmark, TabICL is on par with TabPFNv2 while being systematically faster (up to 10 times), and significantly outperforms all other approaches. On 56 datasets with over 10K samples, TabICL surpasses both TabPFNv2 and CatBoost, demonstrating the potential of ICL for large data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentially Private Synthetic Data via APIs 3: Using Simulators Instead of Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05505v1)** | 2025-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private (DP) synthetic data, which closely resembles the original private data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees, has become a key tool for unlocking the value of private data without compromising privacy. Recently, Private Evolution (PE) has emerged as a promising method for generating DP synthetic data. Unlike other training-based approaches, PE only requires access to inference APIs from foundation models, enabling it to harness the power of state-of-the-art models. However, a suitable foundation model for a specific private data domain is not always available. In this paper, we discover that the PE framework is sufficiently general to allow inference APIs beyond foundation models. Specifically, we show that simulators -- such as computer graphics-based image synthesis tools -- can also serve as effective APIs within the PE framework. This insight greatly expands the applicability of PE, enabling the use of a wide variety of domain-specific simulators for DP data synthesis. We explore the potential of this approach, named Sim-PE, in the context of image synthesis. Across three diverse simulators, Sim-PE performs well, improving the downstream classification accuracy of PE by up to 3x and reducing the FID score by up to 80%. We also show that simulators and foundation models can be easily leveraged together within the PE framework to achieve further improvements. The code is open-sourced in the Private Evolution Python library: https://github.com/microsoft/DPSDA.</p></details> |  |

Yet, all of them were developed based on one fundamental concept, the numerical data fitting. Thus, the models developed have been long known for being problem-specific and lacking application generalizability. A TSF foundation model serving TSF tasks across different applications can reverse such an impression. The central question is then how to develop such a TSF foundation model. This paper offers a pioneering study in developing a TSF foundation model and proposes a vision intelligence-powered framework, ViTime, for the first time. In ViTime, a method synthesizing authentic time series periodic and trend patterns is developed to enrich sample pattern diversity. A deep architecture operating TSF in image metric space is designed to achieve significantly enhanced TSF generalizability. Extensive experiments demonstrate ViTime's SOTA performance across multiple settings. In zero-shot scenarios, ViTime outperforms TimesFM by 9-15%. With just 10% fine-tuning data, ViTime surpasses both foundation models and fully-supervised benchmarks trained on complete datasets, with this performance gap widening further at 100\% fine-tuning. Additionally, ViTime exhibits exceptional robustness, handling missing data without imputation and outperforming TimesFM by 20-30% under various data perturbations.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of FMs and the principles that have driven advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce MoFM as a novel Motion Foundation Model. MoFM is designed for the semantic understanding of complex human motions in both time and space. To facilitate large-scale training, MotionBook, a comprehensive human motion dictionary of discretized motions is designed and employed. MotionBook utilizes Thermal Cubes to capture spatio-temporal motion heatmaps, applying principles from discrete variational models to encode human movements into discrete units for a more efficient and scalable representation. MoFM, trained on a large corpus of motion data, provides a foundational backbone adaptable to diverse downstream tasks, supporting paradigms such as one-shot, unsupervised, and supervised tasks. This versatility makes MoFM well-suited for a wide range of motion-based applications.</p></details> |  |

This raises an important question: How can we train a graph foundational model on multiple source domains and adapt to an unseen target domain? A major obstacle is that graphs from different domains often exhibit divergent characteristics. Some studies leverage large language models to align multiple domains based on textual descriptions associated with the graphs, limiting their applicability to text-attributed graphs. For text-free graphs, a few recent works attempt to align different feature distributions across domains, while generally neglecting structural differences. In this work, we propose a novel Structure Alignment framework for text-free Multi-domain Graph Pre-Training and cross-domain adaptation (SAMGPT). It is designed to learn multi-domain knowledge from graphs originating in multiple source domains, which can then be adapted to address applications in an unseen target domain. Specifically, we introduce a set of structure tokens to harmonize structure-based aggregation across source domains during the pre-training phase. Next, for cross-domain adaptation, we design dual prompts, namely, holistic prompts and specific prompts, which adapt unified multi-domain structural knowledge and fine-grained, domain-specific information, respectively, to a target domain. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness of SAMGPT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2025 Main Track</p></details> |

These systems have evolved into complex, multilayered architectures that leverage vast datasets and often incorporate thousands of predictive models. The maintenance and enhancement of these models is a labor intensive process that requires extensive feature engineering. This approach not only exacerbates technical debt but also hampers innovation in extending these systems to emerging problem domains. In this report, we present our research to address these challenges by utilizing a large foundation model with a textual interface for ranking and recommendation tasks. We illustrate several key advantages of our approach: (1) a single model can manage multiple predictive tasks involved in ranking and recommendation, (2) decoder models with textual interface due to their comprehension of reasoning capabilities, can generalize to new recommendation surfaces and out-of-domain problems, and (3) by employing natural language interfaces for task definitions and verbalizing member behaviors and their social connections, we eliminate the need for feature engineering and the maintenance of complex directed acyclic graphs of model dependencies. We introduce our research pre-production model, 360Brew V1.0, a 150B parameter, decoder-only model that has been trained and fine-tuned on LinkedIn's data and tasks. This model is capable of solving over 30 predictive tasks across various segments of the LinkedIn platform, achieving performance levels comparable to or exceeding those of current production systems based on offline metrics, without task-specific fine-tuning. Notably, each of these tasks is conventionally addressed by dedicated models that have been developed and maintained over multiple years by teams of a similar or larger size than our own.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Foundational Models for Dynamical System Reconstruction: Hierarchical Meta-Learning via Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05335v1)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As foundational models reshape scientific discovery, a bottleneck persists in dynamical system reconstruction (DSR): the ability to learn across system hierarchies. Many meta-learning approaches have been applied successfully to single systems, but falter when confronted with sparse, loosely related datasets requiring multiple hierarchies to be learned. Mixture of Experts (MoE) offers a natural paradigm to address these challenges. Despite their potential, we demonstrate that naive MoEs are inadequate for the nuanced demands of hierarchical DSR, largely due to their gradient descent-based gating update mechanism which leads to slow updates and conflicted routing during training. To overcome this limitation, we introduce MixER: Mixture of Expert Reconstructors, a novel sparse top-1 MoE layer employing a custom gating update algorithm based on $K$-means and least squares. Extensive experiments validate MixER's capabilities, demonstrating efficient training and scalability to systems of up to ten parametric ordinary differential equations. However, our layer underperforms state-of-the-art meta-learners in high-data regimes, particularly when each expert is constrained to process only a fraction of a dataset composed of highly related data points. Further analysis with synthetic and neuroscientific time series suggests that the quality of the contextual representations generated by MixER is closely linked to the presence of hierarchical structure in the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, their lack of reliability and modularity limits their capacity to tackle large problems that require many steps of reasoning. In response, researchers have proposed advanced pipelines that leverage domain-specific knowledge to chain smaller prompts, provide intermediate feedback and improve performance through search. However, the current complexity of writing, tuning, maintaining and improving such pipelines has limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming, a foundational paradigm for building LLM-enabled applications that lets domain experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists in a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful search tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.</p></details> |  |

However, applying LoRA in federated learning environments, where data is distributed across multiple clients, presents unique challenges. Existing methods rely on traditional federated averaging of LoRA adapters, resulting in inexact updates. To address this, we propose Federated Exact LoRA, or FedEx-LoRA, which adds a residual error term to the pretrained frozen weight matrix. Our approach achieves exact updates with minimal computational and communication overhead, preserving LoRA's efficiency. We evaluate the method on various models across arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks, showing consistent performance gains over state-of-the-art methods across multiple settings. Through extensive analysis, we quantify that the deviations in updates from the ideal solution are significant, highlighting the need for exact aggregation.

However, existing models are constrained by closed-vocabulary tokenizers which capture only a fraction of molecular space. In this work, we systematically evaluate thirty tokenizers, including 19 chemistry-specific ones, for their coverage of the SMILES molecular representation language, revealing significant gaps. To assess the impact of tokenizer choice, we introduce n-gram language models as a low-cost proxy and validate their effectiveness by training and fine-tuning 18 RoBERTa-style encoders for molecular property prediction. To overcome the limitations of existing tokenizers, we propose two new tokenizers -- Smirk and Smirk-GPE -- with full coverage of the OpenSMILES specification. Our results highlight the need for open-vocabulary modeling and chemically diverse benchmarks in cheminformatics. The proposed tokenizer framework systematically integrates nuclear, electronic, and geometric degrees of freedom; this facilitates applications in pharmacology, agriculture, biology, and energy storage.</p></details> | 33 pages, 6 figures |

However, task-specific classification models are limited in scope, require costly labeled data, and lack generalizability to out-of-distribution datasets. To address these challenges, we introduce CheXFound, a self-supervised vision foundation model that learns robust CXR representations and generalizes effectively across a wide range of downstream tasks. We pretrain CheXFound on a curated CXR-1M dataset, comprising over one million unique CXRs from publicly available sources. We propose a Global and Local Representations Integration (GLoRI) module for downstream adaptations, by incorporating disease-specific local features with global image features for enhanced performance in multilabel classification. Our experimental results show that CheXFound outperforms state-of-the-art models in classifying 40 disease findings across different prevalence levels on the CXR-LT 24 dataset and exhibits superior label efficiency on downstream tasks with limited training data. Additionally, CheXFound achieved significant improvements on new tasks with out-of-distribution datasets, including opportunistic cardiovascular disease risk estimation and mortality prediction. These results highlight CheXFound's strong generalization capabilities, enabling diverse adaptations with improved label efficiency. The project source code is publicly available at https://github.com/RPIDIAL/CheXFound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transferring Foundation Models for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05716v5)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the generalization capabilities of general-purpose robotic manipulation agents in the real world has long been a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on collecting large-scale robotic data which is costly and time-consuming, such as the RT-1 dataset. However, due to insufficient diversity of data, these approaches typically suffer from limiting their capability in open-domain scenarios with new objects and diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that effectively leverages language-reasoning segmentation mask generated by internet-scale foundation models, to condition robot manipulation tasks. By integrating the mask modality, which incorporates semantic, geometric, and temporal correlation priors derived from vision foundation models, into the end-to-end policy model, our approach can effectively and robustly perceive object pose and enable sample-efficient generalization learning, including new object instances, semantic categories, and unseen backgrounds. We first introduce a series of foundation models to ground natural language demands across multiple tasks. Secondly, we develop a two-stream 2D policy model based on imitation learning, which processes raw images and object masks to predict robot actions with a local-global perception manner. Extensive realworld experiments conducted on a Franka Emika robot arm demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm and policy architecture. Demos can be found in our submitted video, and more comprehensive ones can be found in link1 or link2.</p></details> | WACV 2025, Oral |

Our method features a continuous-discrete state space model (SSM) that can robustly handle the intricate and noisy nature of fMRI signals. To address computational limitations, we implement an approximation strategy grounded in the SOC framework. Additionally, we present a simulation-free latent dynamics approach that employs locally linear approximations, facilitating efficient and scalable inference. For effective representation learning, we derive an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) from the SOC formulation, which integrates smoothly with recent advancements in self-supervised learning (SSL), thereby promoting robust and transferable representations. Pre-trained on extensive datasets such as the UKB, our model attains state-of-the-art results across a variety of downstream tasks, including demographic prediction, trait analysis, disease diagnosis, and prognosis. Moreover, evaluating on external datasets such as HCP-A, ABIDE, and ADHD200 further validates its superior abilities and resilience across different demographic and clinical distributions. Our foundational model provides a scalable and efficient approach for deciphering brain dynamics, opening up numerous applications in neuroscience.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally</p></details> |

This approach has led to superhuman performance across a wide variety of challenging problems including Atari games and robotic control, but requires manually designing heuristics to guide exploration (i.e., determine which states to save and explore from, and what actions to consider next), which is time-consuming and infeasible in general. To resolve this, we propose Intelligent Go-Explore (IGE) which greatly extends the scope of the original Go-Explore by replacing these handcrafted heuristics with the intelligence and internalized human notions of interestingness captured by giant pretrained foundation models (FMs). This provides IGE with a human-like ability to instinctively identify how interesting or promising any new state is (e.g., discovering new objects, locations, or behaviors), even in complex environments where heuristics are hard to define. Moreover, IGE offers the exciting opportunity to recognize and capitalize on serendipitous discoveries -- states encountered during exploration that are valuable in terms of exploration, yet where what makes them interesting was not anticipated by the human user. We evaluate our algorithm on a diverse range of language and vision-based tasks that require search and exploration. Across these tasks, IGE strongly exceeds classic reinforcement learning and graph search baselines, and also succeeds where prior state-of-the-art FM agents like Reflexion completely fail. Overall, Intelligent Go-Explore combines the tremendous strengths of FMs and the powerful Go-Explore algorithm, opening up a new frontier of research into creating more generally capable agents with impressive exploration capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[FRoundation: Are Foundation Models Ready for Face Recognition?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23831v3)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are predominantly trained in an unsupervised or self-supervised manner on highly diverse and large-scale datasets, making them broadly applicable to various downstream tasks. In this work, we investigate for the first time whether such models are suitable for the specific domain of face recognition (FR). We further propose and demonstrate the adaptation of these models for FR across different levels of data availability, including synthetic data. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple foundation models and datasets of varying scales for training and fine-tuning, with evaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Our results indicate that, despite their versatility, pre-trained foundation models tend to underperform in FR in comparison with similar architectures trained specifically for this task. However, fine-tuning foundation models yields promising results, often surpassing models trained from scratch, particularly when training data is limited. For example, after fine-tuning only on 1K identities, DINOv2 ViT-S achieved average verification accuracy on LFW, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP-FP, and AgeDB30 benchmarks of 87.10%, compared to 64.70% achieved by the same model and without fine-tuning. While training the same model architecture, ViT-S, from scratch on 1k identities reached 69.96%. With access to larger-scale FR training datasets, these performances reach 96.03% and 95.59% for the DINOv2 and CLIP ViT-L models, respectively. In comparison to the ViT-based architectures trained from scratch for FR, fine-tuned same architectures of foundation models achieve similar performance while requiring lower training computational costs and not relying on the assumption of extensive data availability. We further demonstrated the use of synthetic face data, showing improved performances over both pre-trained foundation and ViT models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Image and Vision Computing Journal 2025</p></details> |

However, their robustness on low-resolution/pixelated (LR) images, a common challenge in real-world scenarios, remains underexplored. We introduce LR0.FM, a comprehensive benchmark evaluating the impact of low resolution on the zero-shot classification performance of 10 FM(s) across 66 backbones and 15 datasets. We propose a novel metric, Weighted Aggregated Robustness, to address the limitations of existing metrics and better evaluate model performance across resolutions and datasets. Our key findings show that: (i) model size positively correlates with robustness to resolution degradation, (ii) pre-training dataset quality is more important than its size, and (iii) fine-tuned and higher resolution models are less robust against LR. Our analysis further reveals that the model makes semantically reasonable predictions at LR, and the lack of fine-grained details in input adversely impacts the model's initial layers more than the deeper layers. We use these insights and introduce a simple strategy, LR-TK0, to enhance the robustness of models without compromising their pre-trained weights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of LR-TK0 for robustness against low-resolution across several datasets and its generalization capability across backbones and other approaches.

However, despite the prevalence of spatio-temporal data in critical domains such as transportation, public health, and environmental monitoring, spatio-temporal foundation models (STFMs) have not yet achieved comparable success. In this paper, we articulate a vision for the future of STFMs, outlining their essential characteristics and the generalization capabilities necessary for broad applicability. We critically assess the current state of research, identifying gaps relative to these ideal traits, and highlight key challenges that impede their progress. Finally, we explore potential opportunities and directions to advance research towards the aim of effective and broadly applicable STFMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Cell Nuclei AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06381v2)** | 2025-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell nuclei instance segmentation is a crucial task in digital kidney pathology. Traditional automatic segmentation methods often lack generalizability when applied to unseen datasets. Recently, the success of foundation models (FMs) has provided a more generalizable solution, potentially enabling the segmentation of any cell type. In this study, we perform a large-scale evaluation of three widely used state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell nuclei foundation models (Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT). Specifically, we created a highly diverse evaluation dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs) collected from both human and rodent sources, encompassing various tissue types, sizes, and staining methods. To our knowledge, this is the largest-scale evaluation of its kind to date. Our quantitative analysis of the prediction distribution reveals a persistent performance gap in kidney pathology. Among the evaluated models, CellViT demonstrated superior performance in segmenting nuclei in kidney pathology. However, none of the foundation models are perfect; a performance gap remains in general nuclei segmentation for kidney pathology.</p></details> |  |

Given the potentially transformative impact that foundation models can have on the field of radiology, this review aims to establish a standardized terminology concerning foundation models, with a specific focus on the requirements of training data, model training paradigms, model capabilities, and evaluation strategies. We further outline potential pathways to facilitate the training of radiology-specific foundation models, with a critical emphasis on elucidating both the benefits and challenges associated with such models.

Current approaches can be broadly categorized into two strategies: human teleoperation (for imitation learning) and sim-to-real reinforcement learning. The first approach is difficult as it is hard for humans to produce safe and dexterous motions on a different embodiment without touch feedback. The second RL-based approach struggles with the domain gap and involves highly task-specific reward engineering on complex tasks. Our key insight is that RL is effective at learning low-level motion primitives, while humans excel at providing coarse motion commands for complex, long-horizon tasks. Therefore, the optimal solution might be a combination of both approaches. In this paper, we introduce DexterityGen (DexGen), which uses RL to pretrain large-scale dexterous motion primitives, such as in-hand rotation or translation. We then leverage this learned dataset to train a dexterous foundational controller. In the real world, we use human teleoperation as a prompt to the controller to produce highly dexterous behavior. We evaluate the effectiveness of DexGen in both simulation and real world, demonstrating that it is a general-purpose controller that can realize input dexterous manipulation commands and significantly improves stability by 10-100x measured as duration of holding objects across diverse tasks. Notably, with DexGen we demonstrate unprecedented dexterous skills including diverse object reorientation and dexterous tool use such as pen, syringe, and screwdriver for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://zhaohengyin.github.io/dexteritygen</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Randomized Experiments Using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04262v1)** | 2025-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Randomized experiments are the preferred approach for evaluating the effects of interventions, but they are costly and often yield estimates with substantial uncertainty. On the other hand, in silico experiments leveraging foundation models offer a cost-effective alternative that can potentially attain higher statistical precision. However, the benefits of in silico experiments come with a significant risk: statistical inferences are not valid if the models fail to accurately predict experimental responses to interventions. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that integrates the predictions from multiple foundation models with experimental data while preserving valid statistical inference. Our estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal, with asymptotic variance no larger than the standard estimator based on experimental data alone. Importantly, these statistical properties hold even when model predictions are arbitrarily biased. Empirical results across several randomized experiments show that our estimator offers substantial precision gains, equivalent to a reduction of up to 20% in the sample size needed to match the same precision as the standard estimator based on experimental data alone.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of labeled EEG data poses a significant challenge. Foundation models offer a promising solution by leveraging large-scale unlabeled data through pre-training, enabling strong performance across diverse tasks. While both temporal dynamics and inter-channel relationships are vital for understanding EEG signals, existing EEG foundation models primarily focus on the former, overlooking the latter. To address this limitation, we propose a novel foundation model for EEG that integrates both temporal and inter-channel information. Our architecture combines Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which effectively capture relational structures, with a masked autoencoder to enable efficient pre-training. We evaluated our approach using three downstream tasks and experimented with various GNN architectures. The results demonstrate that our proposed model, particularly when employing the GCN architecture with optimized configurations, consistently outperformed baseline methods across all tasks. These findings suggest that our model serves as a robust foundation model for EEG analysis.</p></details> |  |

Annotating a large amount of data is vital and can be a make-or-break factor for the robustness of a tracking model. Robustness is particularly crucial in animal tracking, as accurate tracking over long time horizons is essential for capturing the behavior of animals. However, generating additional annotations using foundation models can be counterproductive, as the quality of the annotations is just as important. Poorly annotated data can introduce noise and inaccuracies, ultimately compromising the performance and accuracy of the trained model. Over-reliance on automated annotations without ensuring precision can lead to diminished results, making careful oversight and quality control essential in the annotation process. Ultimately, we demonstrate that a thoughtful combination of automated annotations and manually annotated data is a valuable strategy, yielding an IDF1 score of 80.8 against blind usage of SAM2 video with an IDF1 score of 65.6.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

Recently, Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) enable open-set semantic segmentation on camera images, potentially aiding automatic labeling. However,VFMs for 3D data have been limited to adaptations of 2D models, which can introduce inconsistencies to 3D labels. This work introduces Label Any Pointcloud (LeAP), leveraging 2D VFMs to automatically label 3D data with any set of classes in any kind of application whilst ensuring label consistency. Using a Bayesian update, point labels are combined into voxels to improve spatio-temporal consistency. A novel 3D Consistency Network (3D-CN) exploits 3D information to further improve label quality. Through various experiments, we show that our method can generate high-quality 3D semantic labels across diverse fields without any manual labeling. Further, models adapted to new domains using our labels show up to a 34.2 mIoU increase in semantic segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

Recently, self-supervised foundation models have been extended to three-dimensional (3D) computed tomography (CT) data, generating compact, information-rich embeddings with 1408 features that achieve state-of-the-art performance on downstream tasks such as intracranial hemorrhage detection and lung cancer risk forecasting. However, these embeddings have been shown to encode demographic information, such as age, sex, and race, which poses a significant risk to the fairness of clinical applications. In this work, we propose a Variation Autoencoder (VAE) based adversarial debiasing framework to transform these embeddings into a new latent space where demographic information is no longer encoded, while maintaining the performance of critical downstream tasks. We validated our approach on the NLST lung cancer screening dataset, demonstrating that the debiased embeddings effectively eliminate multiple encoded demographic information and improve fairness without compromising predictive accuracy for lung cancer risk at 1-year and 2-year intervals. Additionally, our approach ensures the embeddings are robust against adversarial bias attacks. These results highlight the potential of adversarial debiasing techniques to ensure fairness and equity in clinical applications of self-supervised 3D CT embeddings, paving the way for their broader adoption in unbiased medical decision-making.</p></details> |  |

The forecasting solution includes features such as weather conditions, calendar events, and time-of-day patterns. Results demonstrate the strong performance of ML-based meta-models and highlight the emerging potential of foundation models like Chronos and TimesFM, which deliver competitive performance with minimal feature engineering, leveraging only the pre-trained model (zero-shot inference).

While machine learning models trained on PPG signals have shown promise, they tend to be task-specific and struggle with generalization. Current research is limited by the use of single-device datasets, insufficient exploration of out-of-domain generalization, and a lack of publicly available models, which hampers reproducibility. To address these limitations, we present PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. The model is pre-trained on over 57,000 hours of data, comprising 20 million unlabeled PPG segments from publicly available datasets. We introduce a novel representation learning approach that leverages domain knowledge of PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling the capture of richer representations compared to traditional contrastive learning methods. We evaluate PaPaGei against state-of-the-art time-series foundation models and self-supervised learning benchmarks across 20 tasks from 10 diverse datasets, spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our model demonstrates superior performance, improving classification and regression metrics by 6.3% and 2.9% respectively in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei achieves these results while being more data- and parameter-efficient, outperforming models that are 70x larger. Beyond accuracy, we examine model robustness across different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluation in future models.

Graph neural networks excel at learning graph data, the omnipresent non-Euclidean structure, but often lack the generalization capacity. Hence, graph foundation model is drawing increasing attention, and recent efforts have been made to leverage Large Language Models. On the one hand, existing studies primarily focus on text-attributed graphs, while a wider range of real graphs do not contain fruitful textual attributes. On the other hand, the sequential graph description tailored for the Large Language Model neglects the structural complexity, which is a predominant characteristic of the graph. Such limitations motivate an important question: Can we go beyond Large Language Models, and pretrain a universal model to learn the structural knowledge for any graph? The answer in the language or vision domain is a shared vocabulary. We observe the fact that there also exist shared substructures underlying graph domain, and thereby open a new opportunity of graph foundation model with structural vocabulary. The key innovation is the discovery of a simple yet effective structural vocabulary of trees and cycles, and we explore its inherent connection to Riemannian geometry. Herein, we present a universal pretraining model, RiemannGFM. Concretely, we first construct a novel product bundle to incorporate the diverse geometries of the vocabulary. Then, on this constructed space, we stack Riemannian layers where the structural vocabulary, regardless of specific graph, is learned in Riemannian manifold offering cross-domain transferability. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of RiemannGFM on a diversity of real graphs.</p></details> | Accepted by WWW25 |

Unlike previous task-specific or multi-task models, Metis follows a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. It is pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled speech data using masked generative modeling and then fine-tuned to adapt to diverse speech generation tasks. Specifically, 1) Metis utilizes two discrete speech representations: SSL tokens derived from speech self-supervised learning (SSL) features, and acoustic tokens directly quantized from waveforms. 2) Metis performs masked generative pre-training on SSL tokens, utilizing 300K hours of diverse speech data, without any additional condition. 3) Through fine-tuning with task-specific conditions, Metis achieves efficient adaptation to various speech generation tasks while supporting multimodal input, even when using limited data and trainable parameters. Experiments demonstrate that Metis can serve as a foundation model for unified speech generation: Metis outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific or multi-task systems across five speech generation tasks, including zero-shot text-to-speech, voice conversion, target speaker extraction, speech enhancement, and lip-to-speech, even with fewer than 20M trainable parameters or 300 times less training data.

However, despite the success of large-scale pre-training in language and vision domains, pre-trained time series models remain limited in scale and operate at a high cost, hindering the development of larger capable forecasting models in real-world applications. In response, we introduce Time-MoE, a scalable and unified architecture designed to pre-train larger, more capable forecasting foundation models while reducing inference costs. By leveraging a sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) design, Time-MoE enhances computational efficiency by activating only a subset of networks for each prediction, reducing computational load while maintaining high model capacity. This allows Time-MoE to scale effectively without a corresponding increase in inference costs. Time-MoE comprises a family of decoder-only transformer models that operate in an auto-regressive manner and support flexible forecasting horizons with varying input context lengths. We pre-trained these models on our newly introduced large-scale data Time-300B, which spans over 9 domains and encompassing over 300 billion time points. For the first time, we scaled a time series foundation model up to 2.4 billion parameters, achieving significantly improved forecasting precision. Our results validate the applicability of scaling laws for training tokens and model size in the context of time series forecasting. Compared to dense models with the same number of activated parameters or equivalent computation budgets, our models consistently outperform them by large margin. These advancements position Time-MoE as a state-of-the-art solution for tackling real-world time series forecasting challenges with superior capability, efficiency, and flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 13th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025)</p></details> |

Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any attribute combination. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 48 VRP variants show RouteFinder outperforms recent state-of-the-art learning methods.

Moreover, existing GFMs are constrained by rigid output formats, limiting their applicability to various genomic tasks. In this work, we revisit the transformer-based auto-regressive models and introduce Omni-DNA, a family of cross-modal multi-task models ranging from 20 million to 1 billion parameters. Our approach consists of two stages: (i) pretraining on DNA sequences with next token prediction objective, and (ii) expanding the multi-modal task-specific tokens and finetuning for multiple downstream tasks simultaneously. When evaluated on the Nucleotide Transformer and GB benchmarks, Omni-DNA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 18 out of 26 tasks. Through multi-task finetuning, Omni-DNA addresses 10 acetylation and methylation tasks at once, surpassing models trained on each task individually. Finally, we design two complex genomic tasks, DNA2Function and Needle-in-DNA, which map DNA sequences to textual functional descriptions and images, respectively, indicating Omni-DNA's cross-modal capabilities to broaden the scope of genomic applications. All the models are available through https://huggingface.co/collections/zehui127</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond English: Evaluating Automated Measurement of Moral Foundations in Non-English Discourse with a Chinese Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02451v2)** | 2025-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores computational approaches for measuring moral foundations (MFs) in non-English corpora. Since most resources are developed primarily for English, cross-linguistic applications of moral foundation theory remain limited. Using Chinese as a case study, this paper evaluates the effectiveness of applying English resources to machine translated text, local language lexicons, multilingual language models, and large language models (LLMs) in measuring MFs in non-English texts. The results indicate that machine translation and local lexicon approaches are insufficient for complex moral assessments, frequently resulting in a substantial loss of cultural information. In contrast, multilingual models and LLMs demonstrate reliable cross-language performance with transfer learning, with LLMs excelling in terms of data efficiency. Importantly, this study also underscores the need for human-in-the-loop validation of automated MF assessment, as the most advanced models may overlook cultural nuances in cross-language measurements. The findings highlight the potential of LLMs for cross-language MF measurements and other complex multilingual deductive coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In order to effectively learn correspondences and mis-correspondences between an image pair for the change detection task, we propose to a) ``freeze'' the backbone in order to retain the generality of dense foundation features, and b) employ ``full-image'' cross-attention to better tackle the viewpoint variations between the image pair. We evaluate our approach on two benchmark datasets, VL-CMU-CD and PSCD, along with their viewpoint-varied versions. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements in F1-score, particularly in scenarios involving geometric changes between image pairs. The results indicate our method's superior generalization capabilities over existing state-of-the-art approaches, showing robustness against photometric and geometric variations as well as better overall generalization when fine-tuned to adapt to new environments. Detailed ablation studies further validate the contributions of each component in our architecture.

This paper investigates how to efficiently train speech foundation models with self-supervised learning (SSL) under a limited compute budget. We examine critical factors in SSL that impact the budget, including model architecture, model size, and data size. Our goal is to make analytical steps toward understanding the training dynamics of speech foundation models. We benchmark SSL objectives in an entirely comparable setting and find that other factors contribute more significantly to the success of SSL. Our results show that slimmer model architectures outperform common small architectures under the same compute and parameter budget. We demonstrate that the size of the pre-training data remains crucial, even with data augmentation during SSL training, as performance suffers when iterating over limited data. Finally, we identify a trade-off between model size and data size, highlighting an optimal model size for a given compute budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE SLT 2024</p></details> |
| **[3D Foundation AI Model for Generalizable Disease Detection in Head Computed Tomography](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02779v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Head computed tomography (CT) imaging is a widely-used imaging modality with multitudes of medical indications, particularly in assessing pathology of the brain, skull, and cerebrovascular system. It is commonly the first-line imaging in neurologic emergencies given its rapidity of image acquisition, safety, cost, and ubiquity. Deep learning models may facilitate detection of a wide range of diseases. However, the scarcity of high-quality labels and annotations, particularly among less common conditions, significantly hinders the development of powerful models. To address this challenge, we introduce FM-CT: a Foundation Model for Head CT for generalizable disease detection, trained using self-supervised learning. Our approach pre-trains a deep learning model on a large, diverse dataset of 361,663 non-contrast 3D head CT scans without the need for manual annotations, enabling the model to learn robust, generalizable features. To investigate the potential of self-supervised learning in head CT, we employed both discrimination with self-distillation and masked image modeling, and we construct our model in 3D rather than at the slice level (2D) to exploit the structure of head CT scans more comprehensively and efficiently. The model's downstream classification performance is evaluated using internal and three external datasets, encompassing both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Our results demonstrate that the self-supervised foundation model significantly improves performance on downstream diagnostic tasks compared to models trained from scratch and previous 3D CT foundation models on scarce annotated datasets. This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised learning in medical imaging and sets a new benchmark for head CT image analysis in 3D, enabling broader use of artificial intelligence for head CT-based diagnosis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review Preprint</p></details> |

However, the first generation of ML approaches, which depend on supervised learning with annotated data to create task-specific models, faces significant limitations in scaling to the diverse sensor modalities, deployment configurations, application tasks, and operating dynamics characterizing real-world CPS-IoT systems. The success of task-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language models (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language, computer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and exploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics pipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering. Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of FMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be viable for CPS-IoT applications. In this paper, we analyze and characterize this gap through a thorough examination of the state of the art and our research, which extends beyond it in various dimensions. Based on the results of our analysis and research, we identify essential desiderata that CPS-IoT domain-specific FMs and LLMs must satisfy to bridge this gap. We also propose actions by CPS-IoT researchers to collaborate in developing key community resources necessary for establishing FMs and LLMs as foundational tools for the next generation of CPS-IoT systems.</p></details> |  |

While CNN-based models like U-Net have shown success in simplified shadowgraphy-based two-phase flow (TPF) analysis, their application to complex HSV PD tasks remains unexplored, and vision foundation models (VFMs) have yet to address the complexities of either shadowgraphy-based or PD TPF video segmentation. Existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods lack pixel-level reliability for critical metrics like contact line density and dry area fraction, and the absence of large-scale, multimodal experimental datasets tailored to PD segmentation further impedes progress. To address these gaps, we propose MSEG-VCUQ. This hybrid framework integrates U-Net CNNs with the transformer-based Segment Anything Model (SAM) to achieve enhanced segmentation accuracy and cross-modality generalization. Our approach incorporates systematic UQ for robust error assessment and introduces the first open-source multimodal HSV PD datasets. Empirical results demonstrate that MSEG-VCUQ outperforms baseline CNNs and VFMs, enabling scalable and reliable PD segmentation for real-world boiling dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under Review in ICML 25</p></details> |

Despite their inability to match the refined functionalities of their proprietary counterparts, open models hold immense potential to revolutionize healthcare applications. In this paper, we examine the prospects of open-source LLMs and AIFMs for developing healthcare applications and make two key contributions. Firstly, we present a comprehensive survey of the current state-of-the-art open-source healthcare LLMs and AIFMs and introduce a taxonomy of these open AIFMs, categorizing their utility across various healthcare tasks. Secondly, to evaluate the general-purpose applications of open LLMs in healthcare, we present a case study on personalized prescriptions. This task is particularly significant due to its critical role in delivering tailored, patient-specific medications that can greatly improve treatment outcomes. In addition, we compare the performance of open-source models with proprietary models in settings with and without Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Our findings suggest that, although less refined, open LLMs can achieve performance comparable to proprietary models when paired with grounding techniques such as RAG. Furthermore, to highlight the clinical significance of LLMs-empowered personalized prescriptions, we perform subjective assessment through an expert clinician. We also elaborate on ethical considerations and potential risks associated with the misuse of powerful LLMs and AIFMs, highlighting the need for a cautious and responsible implementation in healthcare.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoRA-X: Bridging Foundation Models with Training-Free Cross-Model Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16559v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rising popularity of large foundation models has led to a heightened demand for parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which offer performance comparable to full model fine-tuning while requiring only a few additional parameters tailored to the specific base model. When such base models are deprecated and replaced, all associated LoRA modules must be retrained, requiring access to either the original training data or a substantial amount of synthetic data that mirrors the original distribution. However, the original data is often inaccessible due to privacy or licensing issues, and generating synthetic data may be impractical and insufficiently representative. These factors complicate the fine-tuning process considerably. To address this challenge, we introduce a new adapter, Cross-Model Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA-X), which enables the training-free transfer of LoRA parameters across source and target models, eliminating the need for original or synthetic training data. Our approach imposes the adapter to operate within the subspace of the source base model. This constraint is necessary because our prior knowledge of the target model is limited to its weights, and the criteria for ensuring the adapter's transferability are restricted to the target base model's weights and subspace. To facilitate the transfer of LoRA parameters of the source model to a target model, we employ the adapter only in the layers of the target model that exhibit an acceptable level of subspace similarity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRA-X for text-to-image generation, including Stable Diffusion v1.5 and Stable Diffusion XL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Decision Theoretic Foundations for Conformal Prediction: Optimal Uncertainty Quantification for Risk-Averse Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02561v1)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A fundamental question in data-driven decision making is how to quantify the uncertainty of predictions in ways that can usefully inform downstream action. This interface between prediction uncertainty and decision-making is especially important in risk-sensitive domains, such as medicine. In this paper, we develop decision-theoretic foundations that connect uncertainty quantification using prediction sets with risk-averse decision-making. Specifically, we answer three fundamental questions: (1) What is the correct notion of uncertainty quantification for risk-averse decision makers? We prove that prediction sets are optimal for decision makers who wish to optimize their value at risk. (2) What is the optimal policy that a risk averse decision maker should use to map prediction sets to actions? We show that a simple max-min decision policy is optimal for risk-averse decision makers. Finally, (3) How can we derive prediction sets that are optimal for such decision makers? We provide an exact characterization in the population regime and a distribution free finite-sample construction. Answering these questions naturally leads to an algorithm, Risk-Averse Calibration (RAC), which follows a provably optimal design for deriving action policies from predictions. RAC is designed to be both practical-capable of leveraging the quality of predictions in a black-box manner to enhance downstream utility-and safe-adhering to a user-defined risk threshold and optimizing the corresponding risk quantile of the user's downstream utility. Finally, we experimentally demonstrate the significant advantages of RAC in applications such as medical diagnosis and recommendation systems. Specifically, we show that RAC achieves a substantially improved trade-off between safety and utility, offering higher utility compared to existing methods while maintaining the safety guarantee.</p></details> |  |

Our method addresses three critical requirements for effective training: precise 3D region segmentation, comprehensive textual descriptions, and sufficient dataset scale. By leveraging state-of-the-art open-vocabulary image segmentation models and region-aware Vision-Language Models, we develop an automatic pipeline that generates high-quality 3D mask-text pairs. Applying this pipeline to multiple 3D scene datasets, we create Mosaic3D-5.6M, a dataset of over 30K annotated scenes with 5.6M mask-text pairs, significantly larger than existing datasets. Building upon this data, we propose Mosaic3D, a foundation model combining a 3D encoder trained with contrastive learning and a lightweight mask decoder for open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary 3D semantic and instance segmentation tasks including ScanNet200, Matterport3D, and ScanNet++, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of our large-scale training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://nvlabs.github.io/Mosaic3D/</p></details> |

Even when using MRI, radiologists exhibit low specificity and significant inter-observer variability, leading to potential delays or inaccuracies in identifying clinically significant cancers. This leads to numerous unnecessary biopsies and risks of missing clinically significant cancers. Here we present prostate vision contrastive network (ProViCNet), prostate organ-specific vision foundation models for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Trans-Rectal Ultrasound imaging (TRUS) for comprehensive cancer detection. ProViCNet was trained and validated using 4,401 patients across six institutions, as a prostate cancer detection model on radiology images relying on patch-level contrastive learning guided by biopsy confirmed radiologist annotations. ProViCNet demonstrated consistent performance across multiple internal and external validation cohorts with area under the receiver operating curve values ranging from 0.875 to 0.966, significantly outperforming radiologists in the reader study (0.907 versus 0.805, p<0.001) for mpMRI, while achieving 0.670 to 0.740 for TRUS. We also integrated ProViCNet with standard PSA to develop a virtual screening test, and we showed that we can maintain the high sensitivity for detecting clinically significant cancers while more than doubling specificity from 15% to 38% (p<0.001), thereby substantially reducing unnecessary biopsies. These findings highlight that ProViCNet's potential for enhancing prostate cancer diagnosis accuracy and reduce unnecessary biopsies, thereby optimizing diagnostic pathways.</p></details> | 44pages |

However, the advantages of domain-specific histopathology foundation models over general-purpose models for specialized tasks such as cell analysis remain underexplored. This study investigates the representation learning gap between these two categories by analyzing multi-level patch embeddings applied to cell instance segmentation and classification. We implement an encoder-decoder architecture with a consistent decoder and various encoders. These include convolutional, vision transformer (ViT), and hybrid encoders pre-trained on ImageNet-22K or LVD-142M, representing general-purpose foundation models. These are compared against ViT encoders from the recently released UNI, Virchow2, and Prov-GigaPath foundation models, trained on patches extracted from hundreds of thousands of histopathology whole-slide images. The decoder integrates patch embeddings from different encoder depths via skip connections to generate semantic and distance maps. These maps are then post-processed to create instance segmentation masks where each label corresponds to an individual cell and to perform cell-type classification. All encoders remain frozen during training to assess their pre-trained feature extraction capabilities. Using the PanNuke and CoNIC histopathology datasets, and the newly introduced Nissl-stained CytoDArk0 dataset for brain cytoarchitecture studies, we evaluate instance-level detection, segmentation accuracy, and cell-type classification. This study provides insights into the comparative strengths and limitations of general-purpose vs. histopathology foundation models, offering guidance for model selection in cell-focused histopathology and brain cytoarchitecture analysis workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Model for Composite Materials and Microstructural Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06565v2)** | 2025-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of machine learning has unlocked numerous opportunities for materials science, particularly in accelerating the design and analysis of materials. However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. While foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have excelled in fields like natural language processing by leveraging latent features through transfer learning, their application in materials science remains limited. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed for composite materials. Pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber composites to learn robust latent features, the model accurately predicts homogenized stiffness during transfer learning, even with limited training data. Additionally, our model effectively predicts the material's nonlinear behavior by transferring these learned features to an Interaction-based Material Network, which is a constitutive surrogate model. These results demonstrate the potential of our foundation model to capture complex material behaviors. Our findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond. Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective materials design and analysis.</p></details> |  |

However, a fundamental challenge arises from the substantial differences in graph topologies across domains. Additionally, real-world graphs are often sparse and prone to noisy connections and adversarial attacks. To address these issues, we propose the Multi-Domain Graph Foundation Model (MDGFM), a unified framework that aligns and leverages cross-domain topological information to facilitate robust knowledge transfer. MDGFM bridges different domains by adaptively balancing features and topology while refining original graphs to eliminate noise and align topological structures. To further enhance knowledge transfer, we introduce an efficient prompt-tuning approach. By aligning topologies, MDGFM not only improves multi-domain pre-training but also enables robust knowledge transfer to unseen domains. Theoretical analyses provide guarantees of MDGFM's effectiveness and domain generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on both homophilic and heterophilic graph datasets validate the robustness and efficacy of our method.</p></details> |  |

However, the representation learning capabilities of videotext retrieval models remain constrained by lowquality and limited training data annotations. To address this issue, we present a novel ViDeoText Retrieval Paradigm with RElevance-based AugMentation, namely DREAM, which enhances video and text data using large foundation models to learn more generalized features. Specifically, we first adopt a simple augmentation method, which generates self-similar data by randomly duplicating or dropping subwords and frames. In addition, inspired by the recent advancement in visual and language generative models, we propose a more robust augmentation method through textual paraphrasing and video stylization using large language models (LLMs) and visual generative models (VGMs). To further enrich video and text information, we propose a relevance-based augmentation method, where LLMs and VGMs generate and integrate new relevant information into the original data. Leveraging this enriched data, extensive experiments on several video-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of DREAM over existing methods.</p></details> | NAACL 2025 |

Recent advances in automated harvesting offer a promising solution by enabling efficient, cost-effective, and ergonomic fruit picking within tight harvesting windows. However, existing harvesting technologies often indiscriminately harvest all visible and accessible fruits, including those that are unripe or undersized. This study introduces a novel foundation model-based framework for efficient apple ripeness and size estimation. Specifically, we curated two public RGBD-based Fuji apple image datasets, integrating expanded annotations for ripeness ("Ripe" vs. "Unripe") based on fruit color and image capture dates. The resulting comprehensive dataset, Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset, includes 4,027 images and 16,257 annotated apples with ripeness and size labels. Using Grounding-DINO, a language-model-based object detector, we achieved robust apple detection and ripeness classification, outperforming other state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we developed and evaluated six size estimation algorithms, selecting the one with the lowest error and variation for optimal performance. The Fuji-Ripeness-Size Dataset and the apple detection and size estimation algorithms are made publicly available, which provides valuable benchmarks for future studies in automated and selective harvesting.</p></details> |  |

Extending these capabilities to unseen multimodal distributions, i.e., multimodal domain adaptation and generalization, is even more challenging due to the distinct characteristics of different modalities. Significant progress has been made over the years, with applications ranging from action recognition to semantic segmentation. Besides, the recent advent of large-scale pre-trained multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, has inspired works leveraging these models to enhance adaptation and generalization performances or adapting them to downstream tasks.

Trained on 4.2M global time series samples from NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 data archive at 30m resolution, the new 300M and 600M parameter models incorporate temporal and location embeddings for enhanced performance across various geospatial tasks. Through extensive benchmarking with GEO-Bench, the 600M version outperforms the previous Prithvi-EO model by 8\% across a range of tasks. It also outperforms six other geospatial foundation models when benchmarked on remote sensing tasks from different domains and resolutions (i.e. from 0.1m to 15m). The results demonstrate the versatility of the model in both classical earth observation and high-resolution applications. Early involvement of end-users and subject matter experts (SMEs) are among the key factors that contributed to the project's success. In particular, SME involvement allowed for constant feedback on model and dataset design, as well as successful customization for diverse SME-led applications in disaster response, land use and crop mapping, and ecosystem dynamics monitoring. Prithvi-EO-2.0 is available on Hugging Face and IBM terratorch, with additional resources on GitHub.

To formalise certain properties of the data and to ensure data quality, there is a need to describe the schema of such graphs. Because of the breadth of applications and availability of different data models, such as RDF and property graphs, both the Semantic Web and the database community have independently developed graph schema languages: SHACL, ShEx, and PG-Schema. Each language has its unique approach to defining constraints and validating graph data, leaving potential users in the dark about their commonalities and differences. In this paper, we provide formal, concise definitions of the core components of each of these schema languages.

| **[A Framework for Double-Blind Federated Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01289v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The availability of foundational models (FMs) pre-trained on large-scale data has advanced the state-of-the-art in many computer vision tasks. While FMs have demonstrated good zero-shot performance on many image classification tasks, there is often scope for performance improvement by adapting the FM to the downstream task. However, the data that is required for this adaptation typically exists in silos across multiple entities (data owners) and cannot be collated at a central location due to regulations and privacy concerns. At the same time, a learning service provider (LSP) who owns the FM cannot share the model with the data owners due to proprietary reasons. In some cases, the data owners may not even have the resources to store such large FMs. Hence, there is a need for algorithms to adapt the FM in a double-blind federated manner, i.e., the data owners do not know the FM or each other's data, and the LSP does not see the data for the downstream tasks. In this work, we propose a framework for double-blind federated adaptation of FMs using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). The proposed framework first decomposes the FM into a sequence of FHE-friendly blocks through knowledge distillation. The resulting FHE-friendly model is adapted for the downstream task via low-rank parallel adapters that can be learned without backpropagation through the FM. Since the proposed framework requires the LSP to share intermediate representations with the data owners, we design a privacy-preserving permutation scheme to prevent the data owners from learning the FM through model extraction attacks. Finally, a secure aggregation protocol is employed for federated learning of the low-rank parallel adapters. Empirical results on four datasets demonstrate the practical feasibility of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

The technique utilizes image segmentation methods to identify fixed regions for calculating feature importance scores as explanations. Therefore, poor segmentation can weaken the explanation and reduce the importance of segments, ultimately affecting the overall clarity of interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce the DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME) framework, featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation by foundation model integration, and ii) a user-steered granularity in the hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms on several XAI metrics on pre-trained ImageNet models and improves the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts.

| **[Al-Khwarizmi: Discovering Physical Laws with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01702v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inferring physical laws from data is a central challenge in science and engineering, including but not limited to healthcare, physical sciences, biosciences, social sciences, sustainability, climate, and robotics. Deep networks offer high-accuracy results but lack interpretability, prompting interest in models built from simple components. The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method has become the go-to approach for building such modular and interpretable models. SINDy leverages sparse regression with L1 regularization to identify key terms from a library of candidate functions. However, SINDy's choice of candidate library and optimization method requires significant technical expertise, limiting its widespread applicability. This work introduces Al-Khwarizmi, a novel agentic framework for physical law discovery from data, which integrates foundational models with SINDy. Leveraging LLMs, VLMs, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), our approach automates physical law discovery, incorporating prior knowledge and iteratively refining candidate solutions via reflection. Al-Khwarizmi operates in two steps: it summarizes system observations-comprising textual descriptions, raw data, and plots-followed by a secondary step that generates candidate feature libraries and optimizer configurations to identify hidden physics laws correctly. Evaluating our algorithm on over 198 models, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to alternatives, reaching a 20 percent increase against the best-performing alternative.</p></details> |  |
| **[GFM-RAG: Graph Foundation Model for Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01113v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, conventional RAGs struggle to capture complex relationships between pieces of knowledge, limiting their performance in intricate reasoning that requires integrating knowledge from multiple sources. Recently, graph-enhanced retrieval augmented generation (GraphRAG) builds graph structure to explicitly model these relationships, enabling more effective and efficient retrievers. Nevertheless, its performance is still hindered by the noise and incompleteness within the graph structure. To address this, we introduce GFM-RAG, a novel graph foundation model (GFM) for retrieval augmented generation. GFM-RAG is powered by an innovative graph neural network that reasons over graph structure to capture complex query-knowledge relationships. The GFM with 8M parameters undergoes a two-stage training process on large-scale datasets, comprising 60 knowledge graphs with over 14M triples and 700k documents. This results in impressive performance and generalizability for GFM-RAG, making it the first graph foundation model applicable to unseen datasets for retrieval without any fine-tuning required. Extensive experiments on three multi-hop QA datasets and seven domain-specific RAG datasets demonstrate that GFM-RAG achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining efficiency and alignment with neural scaling laws, highlighting its potential for further improvement.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

Traditional processing methods rely heavily on task-specific designs to address these challenges and fail to account for the variability of data. To address these limitations, we present a generative seismic foundation model (GSFM), a unified framework based on generative diffusion models (GDMs), designed to tackle multi-task seismic processing challenges, including denoising, backscattered noise attenuation, interpolation, and low-frequency extrapolation. GSFM leverages a pre-training stage on synthetic data to capture the features of clean, complete, and broadband seismic data distributions and applies an iterative fine-tuning strategy to adapt the model to field data. By adopting a target-oriented diffusion process prediction, GSFM improves computational efficiency without compromising accuracy. Synthetic data tests demonstrate GSFM surpasses benchmarks with equivalent architectures in all tasks and achieves performance comparable to traditional pre-training strategies, even after their fine-tuning. Also, field data tests suggest that our iterative fine-tuning approach addresses the generalization limitations of conventional pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms, delivering significantly enhanced performance across diverse tasks. Furthermore, GSFM's inherent probabilistic nature enables effective uncertainty quantification, offering valuable insights into the reliability of processing results.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce Pulse-PPG, the first open-source PPG foundation model trained exclusively on raw PPG data collected over a 100-day field study with 120 participants. Existing PPG foundation models are either open-source but trained on clinical data or closed-source, limiting their applicability in real-world settings. We evaluate Pulse-PPG across multiple datasets and downstream tasks, comparing its performance against a state-of-the-art foundation model trained on clinical data. Our results demonstrate that Pulse-PPG, trained on uncurated field data, exhibits superior generalization across clinical and mobile health applications in both lab and field settings. This suggests that exposure to real-world variability enables the model to learn fine-grained representations, making it more adaptable across tasks. Furthermore, pre-training on field data surprisingly outperforms its pre-training on clinical data in many tasks, reinforcing the importance of training on real-world, diverse datasets. To encourage further advancements in robust foundation models leveraging field data, we plan to release Pulse-PPG, providing researchers with a powerful resource for developing more generalizable PPG-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two listed authors contributed equally to this research</p></details> |
| **[Adapting Foundation Models for Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation: Actively and Sequentially](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01000v1)** | 2025-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models have brought promising results in computer vision, including medical image segmentation. Fine-tuning foundation models on specific low-resource medical tasks has become a standard practice. However, ensuring reliable and robust model adaptation when the target task has a large domain gap and few annotated samples remains a challenge. Previous few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) methods seek to bridge the distribution gap between source and target domains by utilizing auxiliary data. The selection and scheduling of auxiliaries are often based on heuristics, which can easily cause negative transfer. In this work, we propose an Active and Sequential domain AdaPtation (ASAP) framework for dynamic auxiliary dataset selection in FSDA. We formulate FSDA as a multi-armed bandit problem and derive an efficient reward function to prioritize training on auxiliary datasets that align closely with the target task, through a single-round fine-tuning. Empirical validation on diverse medical segmentation datasets demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art FSDA methods, achieving an average gain of 27.75% on MRI and 7.52% on CT datasets in Dice score. Code is available at the git repository: https://github.com/techicoco/ASAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[EffoVPR: Effective Foundation Model Utilization for Visual Place Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18065v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of Visual Place Recognition (VPR) is to predict the location of a query image from a database of geo-tagged images. Recent studies in VPR have highlighted the significant advantage of employing pre-trained foundation models like DINOv2 for the VPR task. However, these models are often deemed inadequate for VPR without further fine-tuning on VPR-specific data. In this paper, we present an effective approach to harness the potential of a foundation model for VPR. We show that features extracted from self-attention layers can act as a powerful re-ranker for VPR, even in a zero-shot setting. Our method not only outperforms previous zero-shot approaches but also introduces results competitive with several supervised methods. We then show that a single-stage approach utilizing internal ViT layers for pooling can produce global features that achieve state-of-the-art performance, with impressive feature compactness down to 128D. Moreover, integrating our local foundation features for re-ranking further widens this performance gap. Our method also demonstrates exceptional robustness and generalization, setting new state-of-the-art performance, while handling challenging conditions such as occlusion, day-night transitions, and seasonal variations.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

To predict the next-patch's distribution, we propose a TimeFlow Loss based on flow-matching, which facilitates native pre-training of Transformers on time series without discrete tokenization. Conditioned on arbitrary-length time series, our model is pre-trained without specifying any prior distribution and can generate multiple probable predictions, achieving flexibility in representation learning beyond using parametric densities. Towards time series foundation models, we leverage minimal but crucial adaptations of Transformers and curate TimeBench with 1 trillion time points, comprising mostly real-world datasets and synthetic data. By mitigating mode collapse through TimeFlow Loss, we pre-train a family of Sundial models on TimeBench, which exhibit unprecedented model capacity and generalization performance on zero-shot forecasting. In addition to presenting good scaling behavior, Sundial achieves new state-of-the-art on both point forecasting and probabilistic forecasting benchmarks. We believe that Sundial's pioneering generative paradigm will facilitate a wide variety of forecasting scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroLM: A Universal Multi-task Foundation Model for Bridging the Gap between Language and EEG Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00101v2)** | 2025-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements for large-scale pre-training with neural signals such as electroencephalogram (EEG) have shown promising results, significantly boosting the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and healthcare. However, these pre-trained models often require full fine-tuning on each downstream task to achieve substantial improvements, limiting their versatility and usability, and leading to considerable resource wastage. To tackle these challenges, we propose NeuroLM, the first multi-task foundation model that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by regarding EEG signals as a foreign language, endowing the model with multi-task learning and inference capabilities. Our approach begins with learning a text-aligned neural tokenizer through vector-quantized temporal-frequency prediction, which encodes EEG signals into discrete neural tokens. These EEG tokens, generated by the frozen vector-quantized (VQ) encoder, are then fed into an LLM that learns causal EEG information via multi-channel autoregression. Consequently, NeuroLM can understand both EEG and language modalities. Finally, multi-task instruction tuning adapts NeuroLM to various downstream tasks. We are the first to demonstrate that, by specific incorporation with LLMs, NeuroLM unifies diverse EEG tasks within a single model through instruction tuning. The largest variant NeuroLM-XL has record-breaking 1.7B parameters for EEG signal processing, and is pre-trained on a large-scale corpus comprising approximately 25,000-hour EEG data. When evaluated on six diverse downstream datasets, NeuroLM showcases the huge potential of this multi-task learning paradigm.</p></details> | <details><summary>The T...</summary><p>The Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations</p></details> |

In the Earth science and remote sensing communities, there is growing interest in transforming the use of Earth observation data, including satellite and aerial imagery, through foundation models. Various foundation models have been developed for remote sensing, such as those for multispectral, high-resolution, and hyperspectral images, and have demonstrated superior performance on various downstream tasks compared to traditional supervised models. These models are evolving rapidly, with capabilities to handle multispectral, multitemporal, and multisensor data. Most studies use masked autoencoders in combination with Vision Transformers (ViTs) as the backbone for pretraining. While the models showed promising performance, ViTs face challenges, such as quadratic computational scaling with input length, which may limit performance on multiband and multitemporal data with long sequences. This research aims to address these challenges by proposing SatMamba, a new pretraining framework that combines masked autoencoders with State Space Model, offering linear computational scaling. Experiments on high-resolution imagery across various downstream tasks show promising results, paving the way for more efficient foundation models and unlocking the full potential of Earth observation data.

| **[Current Pathology Foundation Models are unrobust to Medical Center Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18055v2)** | 2025-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology Foundation Models (FMs) hold great promise for healthcare. Before they can be used in clinical practice, it is essential to ensure they are robust to variations between medical centers. We measure whether pathology FMs focus on biological features like tissue and cancer type, or on the well known confounding medical center signatures introduced by staining procedure and other differences. We introduce the Robustness Index. This novel robustness metric reflects to what degree biological features dominate confounding features. Ten current publicly available pathology FMs are evaluated. We find that all current pathology foundation models evaluated represent the medical center to a strong degree. Significant differences in the robustness index are observed. Only one model so far has a robustness index greater than one, meaning biological features dominate confounding features, but only slightly. A quantitative approach to measure the influence of medical center differences on FM-based prediction performance is described. We analyze the impact of unrobustness on classification performance of downstream models, and find that cancer-type classification errors are not random, but specifically attributable to same-center confounders: images of other classes from the same medical center. We visualize FM embedding spaces, and find these are more strongly organized by medical centers than by biological factors. As a consequence, the medical center of origin is predicted more accurately than the tissue source and cancer type. The robustness index introduced here is provided with the aim of advancing progress towards clinical adoption of robust and reliable pathology FMs.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional CNN-based approaches, which often suffer from inaccurate depth estimation and rely on multi-stage object detection pipelines, this study employs a Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model as the backbone, which excels at capturing global features for depth estimation. It integrates a detection transformer (DETR) architecture to improve both depth estimation and object detection performance in a one-stage manner. Specifically, a hierarchical feature fusion block is introduced to extract richer visual features from the foundation model, further enhancing feature extraction capabilities. Depth estimation accuracy is further improved by incorporating a relative depth estimation model trained on large-scale data and fine-tuning it through transfer learning. Additionally, the use of queries in the transformer's decoder, which consider reference points and the dimensions of 2D bounding boxes, enhances recognition performance. The proposed model outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative evaluations on the KITTI 3D benchmark and a custom dataset collected from high-elevation racing environments.

To enhance prediction accuracy, previous studies have integrated diverse data modalities, such as clinical notes, medical images, and genomic data, leveraging their complementary information. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. First, they struggle to incorporate newly arrived data with varying distributions into training, such as patient records from different hospitals, thus rendering sub-optimal generalizability and limited utility in real-world applications. Second, most multimodal integration methods rely on simplistic concatenation or task-specific pipelines, which fail to capture the complex interdependencies across modalities. To address these, we propose a continually evolving multi-modal foundation model. Extensive experiments on the TCGA dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting its potential to advance cancer prognosis by enabling robust and adaptive multimodal integration.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (>100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages including supplement. 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Although MLFF FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods, there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where the smaller "student" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy predictions of the "teacher" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e., computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller, specialized simulation "engines" for common chemical subsets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

However, not all biosignals are the same: high-fidelity biosignals, such as photoplethysmogram (PPG), contain more physiological information, but require optical sensors with a high power footprint. Alternatively, a lower-fidelity biosignal such as accelerometry has a significantly smaller power footprint and is available in almost any wearable device. While accelerometry is widely used for activity recognition and fitness, it is less explored for health biomarkers and diagnosis. Here, we show that an accelerometry foundation model can predict a wide variety of health targets. To achieve improved performance, we distill representational knowledge from PPG encoders to accelerometery encoders using 20 million minutes of unlabeled data, collected from ~172K participants in the Apple Heart and Movement Study under informed consent. We observe strong cross-modal alignment on unseen data, e.g., 99.2% top-1 accuracy for retrieving PPG embeddings from accelerometry embeddings. We show that distilled accelerometry encoders have significantly more informative representations compared to self-supervised or supervised encoders trained directly on accelerometry data, observed by at least 23%-49% improved performance for predicting heart rate and heart rate variability. We also show that distilled accelerometry encoders are readily predictive of a wide array of downstream health targets, i.e., they are generalist foundation models. We believe accelerometry foundation models for health may unlock new opportunities for developing digital biomarkers from any wearable device.</p></details> | updated format |

Here, we argue that genuine "foundation models" of regulatory biology will remain out of reach unless guided by frameworks that integrate mechanistic insight with principled experimental design. We present one such ground-up, semi-mechanistic framework that unifies perturbation-based experimental designs across both in vitro and in vivo CRISPR screens, accounting for differentiating and non-differentiating cellular systems. By revealing previously unrecognised assumptions in published machine learning methods, our approach clarifies links with popular techniques such as variational autoencoders and structural causal models. In practice, this framework suggests a modified loss function that we demonstrate can improve predictive performance, and further suggests an error analysis that informs batching strategies. Ultimately, since cellular regulation emerges from innumerable interactions amongst largely uncharted molecular components, we contend that systems-level understanding cannot be achieved through structural biology alone. Instead, we argue that real progress will require a first-principles perspective on how experiments capture biological phenomena, how data are generated, and how these processes can be reflected in more faithful modelling architectures.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
