| **[Learning Spatial Similarity Distribution for Few-shot Object Counting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11770v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot object counting aims to count the number of objects in a query image that belong to the same class as the given exemplar images. Existing methods compute the similarity between the query image and exemplars in the 2D spatial domain and perform regression to obtain the counting number. However, these methods overlook the rich information about the spatial distribution of similarity on the exemplar images, leading to significant impact on matching accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a network learning Spatial Similarity Distribution (SSD) for few-shot object counting, which preserves the spatial structure of exemplar features and calculates a 4D similarity pyramid point-to-point between the query features and exemplar features, capturing the complete distribution information for each point in the 4D similarity space. We propose a Similarity Learning Module (SLM) which applies the efficient center-pivot 4D convolutions on the similarity pyramid to map different similarity distributions to distinct predicted density values, thereby obtaining accurate count. Furthermore, we also introduce a Feature Cross Enhancement (FCE) module that enhances query and exemplar features mutually to improve the accuracy of feature matching. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods on multiple datasets, including FSC-147 and CARPK.

| **[STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12418v4)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time. The implementation code is available at: \url{https://github.com/LincanLi98/STG-Mamba}.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Model for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13257v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction, a critical aspect of intelligent transportation systems, has been increasingly popular in the field of artificial intelligence, driven by the availability of extensive traffic data. The current challenges of traffic flow prediction lie in integrating diverse factors while balancing the trade-off between computational complexity and the precision necessary for effective long-range and large-scale predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-Mamba) model, which is the first to leverage the power of spatial-temporal learning in traffic flow prediction without using graph modeling. The ST-Mamba model can effectively capture the long-range dependency for traffic flow data, thereby avoiding the issue of over-smoothing. The proposed ST-Mamba model incorporates an effective Spatial-Temporal Mixer (ST-Mixer) to seamlessly integrate spatial and temporal data processing into a unified framework and employs a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-SSM) block to improve computational efficiency. The proposed ST-Mamba model, specifically designed for spatial-temporal data, simplifies processing procedure and enhances generalization capabilities, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of long-range traffic flow prediction. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the proposed ST-Mamba model achieves a 61.11\% improvement in computational speed and increases prediction accuracy by 0.67\%. Extensive experiments with real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the \textsf{ST-Mamba} model sets a new benchmark in traffic flow prediction, achieving SOTA performance in computational efficiency for both long- and short-range predictions and significantly improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Spatial Models for Crowdsourced Internet Access Network Performance Measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11138v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant investments in access network infrastructure, universal access to high-quality Internet connectivity remains a challenge. Policymakers often rely on large-scale, crowdsourced measurement datasets to assess the distribution of access network performance across geographic areas. These decisions typically rest on the assumption that Internet performance is uniformly distributed within predefined social boundaries, such as zip codes, census tracts, or community areas. However, this assumption may not be valid for two reasons: (1) crowdsourced measurements often exhibit non-uniform sampling densities within geographic areas; and (2) predefined social boundaries may not align with the actual boundaries of Internet infrastructure. In this paper, we model Internet performance as a spatial process. We apply and evaluate a series of statistical techniques to: (1) aggregate Internet performance over a geographic region; (2) overlay interpolated maps with various sampling boundary choices; and (3) spatially cluster boundary units to identify areas with similar performance characteristics. We evaluated the effectiveness of these using a 17-month-long crowdsourced dataset from Ookla Speedtest. We evaluate several leading interpolation methods at varying spatial scales. Further, we examine the similarity between the resulting boundaries for smaller realizations of the dataset. Our findings suggest that our combination of techniques achieves a 56% gain in similarity score over traditional methods that rely on aggregates over raw measurement values for performance summarization. Our work highlights an urgent need for more sophisticated strategies in understanding and addressing Internet access disparities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and spatial downscaling for solar radiation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11046v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global and regional climate model projections are useful for gauging future patterns of climate variables, including solar radiation, but data from these models is often too coarse to assess local impacts. Within the context of solar radiation, the changing climate may have an effect on photovoltaic (PV) production, especially as the PV industry moves to extend plant lifetimes to 50 years. Predicting PV production while taking into account a changing climate requires data at a resolution that is useful for building PV plants. Although temporal and spatial downscaling of solar radiation data is widely studied, we present a novel method to downscale solar radiation data from daily averages to hourly profiles, while maintaining spatial correlation of parameters characterizing the diurnal profile of solar radiation. The method focuses on the use of a diurnal template which can be shifted and scaled according to the time or year and location and the use of thin plate splines for spatial downscaling. This analysis is applied to data from the National Solar Radiation Database housed at the National Renewable Energy Lab and a case study of the mentioned methods over several sub-regions of continental United States is presented.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |
| **[How Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial-Temporal Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14192v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting. Remarkably, our approach achieves competitive performance on par with dedicated SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast and Scalable Inference for Spatial Extreme Value Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.07051v3)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generalized extreme value (GEV) distribution is a popular model for analyzing and forecasting extreme weather data. To increase prediction accuracy, spatial information is often pooled via a latent Gaussian process (GP) on the GEV parameters. Inference for GEV-GP models is typically carried out using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, or using approximate inference methods such as the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA). However, MCMC becomes prohibitively slow as the number of spatial locations increases, whereas INLA is only applicable in practice to a limited subset of GEV-GP models. In this paper, we revisit the original Laplace approximation for fitting spatial GEV models. In combination with a popular sparsity-inducing spatial covariance approximation technique, we show through simulations that our approach accurately estimates the Bayesian predictive distribution of extreme weather events, is scalable to several thousand spatial locations, and is several orders of magnitude faster than MCMC. A case study in forecasting extreme snowfall across Canada is presented.</p></details> |  |
| **[Process-based Inference for Spatial Energetics Using Bayesian Predictive Stacking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09906v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid developments in streaming data technologies have enabled real-time monitoring of human activity that can deliver high-resolution data on health variables over trajectories or paths carved out by subjects as they conduct their daily physical activities. Wearable devices, such as wrist-worn sensors that monitor gross motor activity, have become prevalent and have kindled the emerging field of ``spatial energetics'' in environmental health sciences. We devise a Bayesian inferential framework for analyzing such data while accounting for information available on specific spatial coordinates comprising a trajectory or path using a Global Positioning System (GPS) device embedded within the wearable device. We offer full probabilistic inference with uncertainty quantification using spatial-temporal process models adapted for data generated from ``actigraph'' units as the subject traverses a path or trajectory in their daily routine. Anticipating the need for fast inference for mobile health data, we pursue exact inference using conjugate Bayesian models and employ predictive stacking to assimilate inference across these individual models. This circumvents issues with iterative estimation algorithms such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. We devise Bayesian predictive stacking in this context for models that treat time as discrete epochs and that treat time as continuous. We illustrate our methods with simulation experiments and analysis of data from the Physical Activity through Sustainable Transport Approaches (PASTA-LA) study conducted by the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p></details> | 38 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Solar multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution with a spatially variant convolution neural emulator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09864v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of astronomical phenomena through ground-based observations is always challenged by the distorting effects of Earth's atmosphere. Traditional methods of post-facto image correction, essential for correcting these distortions, often rely on simplifying assumptions that limit their effectiveness, particularly in the presence of spatially variant atmospheric turbulence. Such cases are often solved by partitioning the field-of-view into small patches, deconvolving each patch independently, and merging all patches together. This approach is often inefficient and can produce artifacts. Recent advancements in computational techniques and the advent of deep learning offer new pathways to address these limitations. This paper introduces a novel framework leveraging a deep neural network to emulate spatially variant convolutions, offering a breakthrough in the efficiency and accuracy of astronomical image deconvolution. By training on a dataset of images convolved with spatially invariant point spread functions and validating its generalizability to spatially variant conditions, this approach presents a significant advancement over traditional methods. The convolution emulator is used as a forward model in a multi-object multi-frame blind deconvolution algorithm for solar images. The emulator enables the deconvolution of solar observations across large fields of view without resorting to patch-wise mosaicking, thus avoiding artifacts associated with such techniques. This method represents a significant computational advantage, reducing processing times by orders of magnitude.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 14 figures, accepted for publication in A&A</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Spatial Object Relations Modeling for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15691v2)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task where an agent is required to navigate to a natural language described location via vision observations. The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[NeuroHash: A Hyperdimensional Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Spatially-Aware Image Hashing and Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11025v2)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the face of burgeoning image data, efficiently retrieving similar images poses a formidable challenge. Past research has focused on refining hash functions to distill images into compact indicators of resemblance. Initial attempts used shallow models, evolving to attention mechanism-based architectures from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to advanced models. Recognizing limitations in gradient-based models for spatial information embedding, we propose an innovative image hashing method, NeuroHash leveraging Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC). HDC symbolically encodes spatial information into high-dimensional vectors, reshaping image representation. Our approach combines pre-trained large vision models with HDC operations, enabling spatially encoded feature representations. Hashing with locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) ensures swift and efficient image retrieval. Notably, our framework allows dynamic hash manipulation for conditional image retrieval. Our work introduces a transformative image hashing framework enabling spatial-aware conditional retrieval. By seamlessly combining DNN-based neural and HDC-based symbolic models, our methodology breaks from traditional training, offering flexible and conditional image retrieval. Performance evaluations signify a paradigm shift in image-hashing methodologies, demonstrating enhanced retrieval accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726v4)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising hyperspectral images (HSIs) is a crucial preprocessing procedure due to the noise originating from intra-imaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Utilizing domain-specific knowledge of HSIs, such as spectral correlation, spatial self-similarity, and spatial-spectral correlation, is essential for deep learning-based denoising. Existing methods are often constrained by running time, space complexity, and computational complexity, employing strategies that explore these priors separately. While these strategies can avoid some redundant information, they inevitably overlook broader and more underlying long-range spatial-spectral information that positively impacts image restoration. This paper proposes a Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model-based U-shaped network, termed Spatial-Spectral U-Mamba (SSUMamba), for hyperspectral image denoising. We can obtain complete global spatial-spectral correlation within a module thanks to the linear space complexity in State Space Model (SSM) computations. We introduce a Spatial-Spectral Alternating Scan (SSAS) strategy for HSIs, which helps model the information flow in multiple directions in 3-D HSIs. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms compared methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attribute reduction algorithm of rough sets based on spatial optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09292v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rough set is one of the important methods for rule acquisition and attribute reduction. The current goal of rough set attribute reduction focuses more on minimizing the number of reduced attributes, but ignores the spatial similarity between reduced and decision attributes, which may lead to problems such as increased number of rules and limited generality. In this paper, a rough set attribute reduction algorithm based on spatial optimization is proposed. By introducing the concept of spatial similarity, to find the reduction with the highest spatial similarity, so that the spatial similarity between reduction and decision attributes is higher, and more concise and widespread rules are obtained. In addition, a comparative experiment with the traditional rough set attribute reduction algorithms is designed to prove the effectiveness of the rough set attribute reduction algorithm based on spatial optimization, which has made significant improvements on many datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Generative Techniques for Spatial-Temporal Data Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09592v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on the integration of generative techniques into spatial-temporal data mining, considering the significant growth and diverse nature of spatial-temporal data. With the advancements in RNNs, CNNs, and other non-generative techniques, researchers have explored their application in capturing temporal and spatial dependencies within spatial-temporal data. However, the emergence of generative techniques such as LLMs, SSL, Seq2Seq and diffusion models has opened up new possibilities for enhancing spatial-temporal data mining further. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of generative technique-based spatial-temporal methods and introduces a standardized framework specifically designed for the spatial-temporal data mining pipeline. By offering a detailed review and a novel taxonomy of spatial-temporal methodology utilizing generative techniques, the paper enables a deeper understanding of the various techniques employed in this field. Furthermore, the paper highlights promising future research directions, urging researchers to delve deeper into spatial-temporal data mining. It emphasizes the need to explore untapped opportunities and push the boundaries of knowledge to unlock new insights and improve the effectiveness and efficiency of spatial-temporal data mining. By integrating generative techniques and providing a standardized framework, the paper contributes to advancing the field and encourages researchers to explore the vast potential of generative techniques in spatial-temporal data mining.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Universal Spatial Audio Transcoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04471v2)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges associated with both the conversion between different spatial audio formats and the decoding of a spatial audio format to a specific loudspeaker layout. Existing approaches often rely on layout remapping tools, which may not guarantee optimal conversion from a psychoacoustic perspective. To overcome these challenges, we present the Universal Spatial Audio Transcoder (USAT) method and its corresponding open source implementation. USAT generates an optimal decoder or transcoder for any input spatial audio format, adapting it to any output format or 2D/3D loudspeaker configuration. Drawing upon optimization techniques based on psychoacoustic principles, the algorithm maximizes the preservation of spatial information. We present examples of the decoding and transcoding of several audio formats, and show that USAT approach is advantageous compared to the most common methods in the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining for Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09006v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) consistently requires language and appearance semantics to more understand each other. The need becomes acute especially under hard situations. To achieve, existing works tend to resort to various trans-representing mechanisms to directly feed forward language semantic along main RGB branch, which however will result in referent distribution weakly-mined in space and non-referent semantic contaminated along channel. In this paper, we propose Spatial Semantic Recurrent Mining (S\textsuperscript{2}RM) to achieve high-quality cross-modality fusion. It follows a working strategy of trilogy: distributing language feature, spatial semantic recurrent coparsing, and parsed-semantic balancing. During fusion, S\textsuperscript{2}RM will first generate a constraint-weak yet distribution-aware language feature, then bundle features of each row and column from rotated features of one modality context to recurrently correlate relevant semantic contained in feature from other modality context, and finally resort to self-distilled weights to weigh on the contributions of different parsed semantics. Via coparsing, S\textsuperscript{2}RM transports information from the near and remote slice layers of generator context to the current slice layer of parsed context, capable of better modeling global relationship bidirectional and structured. Besides, we also propose a Cross-scale Abstract Semantic Guided Decoder (CASG) to emphasize the foreground of the referent, finally integrating different grained features at a comparatively low cost. Extensive experimental results on four current challenging datasets show that our proposed method performs favorably against other state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAnet: A New Temporal Attention Network for EEG-based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding with a Short Decision Window](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05819v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) is used to determine the direction of a listener's attention to a speaker by analyzing her/his electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This study aimed to further improve the performance of ASAD with a short decision window (i.e., <1 s) rather than with long decision windows ranging from 1 to 5 seconds in previous studies. An end-to-end temporal attention network (i.e., TAnet) was introduced in this work. TAnet employs a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, which can more effectively capture the interactions among time steps in collected EEG signals and efficiently assign corresponding weights to those EEG time steps. Experiments demonstrated that, compared with the CNN-based method and recent ASAD methods, TAnet provided improved decoding performance in the KUL dataset, with decoding accuracies of 92.4% (decision window 0.1 s), 94.9% (0.25 s), 95.1% (0.3 s), 95.4% (0.4 s), and 95.5% (0.5 s) with short decision windows (i.e., <1 s). As a new ASAD model with a short decision window, TAnet can potentially facilitate the design of EEG-controlled intelligent hearing aids and sound recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Guided Interpretable Facial Expression Recognition via Spatial Action Unit Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00281v5)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although state-of-the-art classifiers for facial expression recognition (FER) can achieve a high level of accuracy, they lack interpretability, an important feature for end-users. Experts typically associate spatial action units (\aus) from a codebook to facial regions for the visual interpretation of expressions. In this paper, the same expert steps are followed. A new learning strategy is proposed to explicitly incorporate \au cues into classifier training, allowing to train deep interpretable models. During training, this \au codebook is used, along with the input image expression label, and facial landmarks, to construct a \au heatmap that indicates the most discriminative image regions of interest w.r.t the facial expression. This valuable spatial cue is leveraged to train a deep interpretable classifier for FER. This is achieved by constraining the spatial layer features of a classifier to be correlated with \au heatmaps. Using a composite loss, the classifier is trained to correctly classify an image while yielding interpretable visual layer-wise attention correlated with \au maps, simulating the expert decision process. Our strategy only relies on image class expression for supervision, without additional manual annotations. Our new strategy is generic, and can be applied to any deep CNN- or transformer-based classifier without requiring any architectural change or significant additional training time. Our extensive evaluation on two public benchmarks \rafdb, and \affectnet datasets shows that our proposed strategy can improve layer-wise interpretability without degrading classification performance. In addition, we explore a common type of interpretable classifiers that rely on class activation mapping (CAM) methods, and show that our approach can also improve CAM interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 11 figures, 3 tables, International Conference on Automatic Face and Gesture Recognition (FG 2024)</p></details> |
| **[HandS3C: 3D Hand Mesh Reconstruction with State Space Spatial Channel Attention from RGB images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01066v3)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing the hand mesh from one single RGB image is a challenging task because hands are often occluded by other objects. Most previous works attempt to explore more additional information and adopt attention mechanisms for improving 3D reconstruction performance, while it would increase computational complexity simultaneously. To achieve a performance-reserving architecture with high computational efficiency, in this work, we propose a simple but effective 3D hand mesh reconstruction network (i.e., HandS3C), which is the first time to incorporate state space model into the task of hand mesh reconstruction. In the network, we design a novel state-space spatial-channel attention module that extends the effective receptive field, extracts hand features in the spatial dimension, and enhances regional features of hands in the channel dimension. This helps to reconstruct a complete and detailed hand mesh. Extensive experiments conducted on well-known datasets facing heavy occlusions (such as FREIHAND, DEXYCB, and HO3D) demonstrate that our proposed HandS3C achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a minimal parameters.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Estimating Direct and Indirect Causal Effects of Spatiotemporal Interventions in Presence of Spatial Interference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08174v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial interference (SI) occurs when the treatment at one location affects the outcomes at other locations. Accounting for spatial interference in spatiotemporal settings poses further challenges as interference violates the stable unit treatment value assumption, making it infeasible for standard causal inference methods to quantify the effects of time-varying treatment at spatially varying outcomes. In this paper, we first formalize the concept of spatial interference in case of time-varying treatment assignments by extending the potential outcome framework under the assumption of no unmeasured confounding. We then propose our deep learning based potential outcome model for spatiotemporal causal inference. We utilize latent factor modeling to reduce the bias due to time-varying confounding while leveraging the power of U-Net architecture to capture global and local spatial interference in data over time. Our causal estimators are an extension of average treatment effect (ATE) for estimating direct (DATE) and indirect effects (IATE) of spatial interference on treated and untreated data. Being the first of its kind deep learning based spatiotemporal causal inference technique, our approach shows advantages over several baseline methods based on the experiment results on two synthetic datasets, with and without spatial interference. Our results on real-world climate dataset also align with domain knowledge, further demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

| **[spAbundance: An R package for single-species and multi-species spatially explicit abundance models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19446v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous modeling techniques exist to estimate abundance of plant and wildlife species. These methods seek to estimate abundance while accounting for multiple complexities found in ecological data, such as observational biases, spatial autocorrelation, and species correlations. There is, however, a lack of user-friendly and computationally efficient software to implement the various models, particularly for large data sets. We developed the spAbundance R package for fitting spatially-explicit Bayesian single-species and multi-species hierarchical distance sampling models, N-mixture models, and generalized linear mixed models. The models within the package can account for spatial autocorrelation using Nearest Neighbor Gaussian Processes and accommodate species correlations in multi-species models using a latent factor approach, which enables model fitting for data sets with large numbers of sites and/or species. We provide three vignettes and three case studies that highlight spAbundance functionality. We used spatially-explicit multi-species distance sampling models to estimate density of 16 bird species in Florida, USA, an N-mixture model to estimate Black-throated Blue Warbler (Setophaga caerulescens) abundance in New Hampshire, USA, and a spatial linear mixed model to estimate forest aboveground biomass across the continental USA. spAbundance provides a user-friendly, formula-based interface to fit a variety of univariate and multivariate spatially-explicit abundance models. The package serves as a useful tool for ecologists and conservation practitioners to generate improved inference and predictions on the spatial drivers of populations and communities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrity Monitoring of 3D Object Detection in Automated Driving Systems using Raw Activation Patterns and Spatial Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07600v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deep neural network (DNN) models are widely used for object detection in automated driving systems (ADS). Yet, such models are prone to errors which can have serious safety implications. Introspection and self-assessment models that aim to detect such errors are therefore of paramount importance for the safe deployment of ADS. Current research on this topic has focused on techniques to monitor the integrity of the perception mechanism in ADS. Existing introspection models in the literature, however, largely concentrate on detecting perception errors by assigning equal importance to all parts of the input data frame to the perception module. This generic approach overlooks the varying safety significance of different objects within a scene, which obscures the recognition of safety-critical errors, posing challenges in assessing the reliability of perception in specific, crucial instances. Motivated by this shortcoming of state of the art, this paper proposes a novel method integrating raw activation patterns of the underlying DNNs, employed by the perception module, analysis with spatial filtering techniques. This novel approach enhances the accuracy of runtime introspection of the DNN-based 3D object detections by selectively focusing on an area of interest in the data, thereby contributing to the safety and efficacy of ADS perception self-assessment processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ITSC 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.07685</p></details> |
| **[CSA-Net: Channel-wise Spatially Autocorrelated Attention Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05755v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with channel-wise feature refining mechanisms have brought noticeable benefits to modelling channel dependencies. However, current attention paradigms fail to infer an optimal channel descriptor capable of simultaneously exploiting statistical and spatial relationships among feature maps. In this paper, to overcome this shortcoming, we present a novel channel-wise spatially autocorrelated (CSA) attention mechanism. Inspired by geographical analysis, the proposed CSA exploits the spatial relationships between channels of feature maps to produce an effective channel descriptor. To the best of our knowledge, this is the f irst time that the concept of geographical spatial analysis is utilized in deep CNNs. The proposed CSA imposes negligible learning parameters and light computational overhead to the deep model, making it a powerful yet efficient attention module of choice. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed CSA networks (CSA-Nets) through extensive experiments and analysis on ImageNet, and MS COCO benchmark datasets for image classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The experimental results demonstrate that CSA-Nets are able to consistently achieve competitive performance and superior generalization than several state-of-the-art attention-based CNNs over different benchmark tasks and datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, the pursuit of accuracy in current studies leads to large, long-timestep SNNs, conflicting with the resource constraints of these devices. In order to design lightweight and efficient SNNs, we propose a new approach named LitE-SNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal compression into the automated network design process. Spatially, we present a novel Compressive Convolution block (CompConv) to expand the search space to support pruning and mixed-precision quantization. Temporally, we are the first to propose a compressive timestep search to identify the optimal number of timesteps under specific computation cost constraints. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization to simultaneously learn the architecture parameters and spatial-temporal compression strategies to achieve high performance while minimizing memory and computation costs. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Google Speech Command datasets demonstrate our proposed LitE-SNNs can achieve competitive or even higher accuracy with remarkably smaller model sizes and fewer computation costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Spatial Discretization Error on Coarse CFD Simulations Using an OpenFOAM-Embedded Deep Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07441v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for reducing the spatial discretization error of coarse computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by enhancing the quality of low-resolution simulations using a deep learning model fed with high-quality data. We substitute the default differencing scheme for the convection term by a feed-forward neural network that interpolates velocities from cell centers to face values to produce velocities that approximate the fine-mesh data well. The deep learning framework incorporates the open-source CFD code OpenFOAM, resulting in an end-to-end differentiable model. We automatically differentiate the CFD physics using a discrete adjoint code version. We present a fast communication method between TensorFlow (Python) and OpenFOAM (c++) that accelerates the training process. We applied the model to the flow past a square cylinder problem, reducing the error to about 50% for simulations outside the training distribution compared to the traditional solver in the x- and y-velocity components using an 8x coarser mesh. The training is affordable in terms of time and data samples since the architecture exploits the local features of the physics while generating stable predictions for mid-term simulations.</p></details> |  |

Intersectoral GDP contributions reveal the economic development of different sectors of the national economy. Linking intersectoral GDP contributions to Gini coefficients will provide better understandings of how the Gini coefficient is influenced by different industries. In this paper, a compositional regression with spatially clustered coefficients is proposed to explore heterogeneous effects over spatial locations under nonparametric Bayesian framework. Specifically, a Markov random field constraint mixture of finite mixtures prior is designed for Bayesian log contrast regression with compostional covariates, which allows for both spatially contiguous clusters and discontinous clusters. In addition, an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for posterior sampling that enables simultaneous inference on both cluster configurations and cluster-wise parameters is designed. The compelling empirical performance of the proposed method is demonstrated via extensive simulation studies and an application to 51 states of United States from 2019 Bureau of Economic Analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Bayesian inference for spatial mean-parameterized Conway-Maxwell-Poisson models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11472v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Count data with complex features arise in many disciplines, including ecology, agriculture, criminology, medicine, and public health. Zero inflation, spatial dependence, and non-equidispersion are common features in count data. There are two classes of models that allow for these features -- he mode-parameterized Conway--Maxwell--Poisson (COMP) distribution and the generalized Poisson model. However both require the use of either constraints on the parameter space or a parameterization that leads to challenges in interpretability. We propose a spatial mean-parameterized COMP model that retains the flexibility of these models while resolving the above issues. We use a Bayesian spatial filtering approach in order to efficiently handle high-dimensional spatial data and we use reversible-jump MCMC to automatically choose the basis vectors for spatial filtering. The COMP distribution poses two additional computational challenges -- an intractable normalizing function in the likelihood and no closed-form expression for the mean. We propose a fast computational approach that addresses these challenges by, respectively, introducing an efficient auxiliary variable algorithm and pre-computing key approximations for fast likelihood evaluation. We illustrate the application of our methodology to simulated and real datasets, including Texas HPV-cancer data and US vaccine refusal data.</p></details> |  |

These drivers impact the trajectory of evolution, and have been hypothesized to influence phylogenetic structure. Here, we set out to assess (1) if spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure leave detectable signatures in phylogenetic structure, (2) the extent, in particular, to which ecology can be detected and discerned in the presence of spatial structure, and (3) the extent to which these phylogenetic signatures generalize across evolutionary systems. To this end, we analyze phylogenies generated by manipulating spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure within three computational models of varied scope and sophistication. We find that selection pressure, spatial structure, and ecology have characteristic effects on phylogenetic metrics, although these effects are complex and not always intuitive. Signatures have some consistency across systems when using equivalent taxonomic unit definitions (e.g., individual, genotype, species). Further, we find that sufficiently strong ecology can be detected in the presence of spatial structure. We also find that, while low-resolution phylogenetic reconstructions can bias some phylogenetic metrics, high-resolution reconstructions recapitulate them faithfully. Although our results suggest potential for evolutionary inference of spatial structure, ecology, and selection pressure through phylogenetic analysis, further methods development is needed to distinguish these drivers' phylometric signatures from each other and to appropriately normalize phylogenetic metrics. With such work, phylogenetic analysis could provide a versatile toolkit to study large-scale evolving populations.</p></details> |  |

The advent of spatial computing and Extended Reality technologies further pushes the boundaries, promising a fusion of physical and digital realms through interactive environments. This paper delves into the progression from All Realities technologies encompassing Augmented Reality, Virtual Reality, and Mediated Reality to spatial computing, highlighting their conceptual differences and applications. We explore enabling technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, the Internet of Things, 5G, cloud and edge computing, and blockchain that underpin the development of spatial computing. We further scrutinize the initial forays into commercial spatial computing devices, with a focus on Apple's Vision Pro, evaluating its technological advancements alongside the challenges it faces. Through this examination, we aim to provide insights into the potential of spatial computing to revolutionize our interaction with digital information and the physical world.</p></details> |  |

The work also introduces a publicly available dataset of imagery, building polygons, and human-generated and curated adjustments that can be used to evaluate existing strategies for aligning building polygons with sUAS imagery. There are no efforts that have aligned pre-existing spatial data with sUAS imagery, and thus, there is no clear state of practice. However, this effort and analysis show that the translational alignment errors present in this type of data, averaging 82px and an intersection over the union of 0.65, which would induce further errors and biases in downstream machine learning systems unless addressed. This study identifies and analyzes the translational alignment errors of 21,619 building polygons in fifty-one orthomosaic images, covering 16787.2 Acres (26.23 square miles), constructed from sUAS raw imagery from nine wide-area disasters (Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Harvey, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Ida, Hurricane Idalia, Hurricane Laura, the Mayfield Tornado, the Musset Bayou Fire, and the Kilauea Eruption). The analysis finds no uniformity among the angle and distance metrics of the building polygon alignments as they present an average degree variance of 0.4 and an average pixel distance variance of 0.45. This work alerts the sUAS community to the problem of spatial alignment and that a simple linear transform, often used to align satellite imagery, will not be sufficient to align spatial data in sUAS orthomosaic imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Pixel-level Classifier for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06525v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vanilla pixel-level classifiers for semantic segmentation are based on a certain paradigm, involving the inner product of fixed prototypes obtained from the training set and pixel features in the test image. This approach, however, encounters significant limitations, i.e., feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the spatial domain. The former struggles with large intra-class variance among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the structured information of semantic objects effectively. This leads to blurred mask boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive (SSA) classifier to address the above challenges. Specifically, we employ the coarse masks obtained from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype towards the center of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image. The adapted prototypes in semantic and spatial domains are then simultaneously considered to accomplish classification decisions. In addition, we propose an online multi-domain distillation learning strategy to improve the adaption process. Experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA significantly improves the segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal increase in computational cost.

| **[Evaluating Adversarial Robustness in the Spatial Frequency Domain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06345v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have dominated the majority of computer vision tasks. However, CNNs' vulnerability to adversarial attacks has raised concerns about deploying these models to safety-critical applications. In contrast, the Human Visual System (HVS), which utilizes spatial frequency channels to process visual signals, is immune to adversarial attacks. As such, this paper presents an empirical study exploring the vulnerability of CNN models in the frequency domain. Specifically, we utilize the discrete cosine transform (DCT) to construct the Spatial-Frequency (SF) layer to produce a block-wise frequency spectrum of an input image and formulate Spatial Frequency CNNs (SF-CNNs) by replacing the initial feature extraction layers of widely-used CNN backbones with the SF layer. Through extensive experiments, we observe that SF-CNN models are more robust than their CNN counterparts under both white-box and black-box attacks. To further explain the robustness of SF-CNNs, we compare the SF layer with a trainable convolutional layer with identical kernel sizes using two mixing strategies to show that the lower frequency components contribute the most to the adversarial robustness of SF-CNNs. We believe our observations can guide the future design of robust CNN models.</p></details> | 14 pages |

The main challenges for traffic flow forecasting are that (1) as the length of prediction time increases, the accuracy of prediction will decrease; (2) the predicted results greatly rely on the extraction of temporal and spatial dependencies from the road networks. To overcome the challenges mentioned above, we propose a multi-channel spatial-temporal transformer model for traffic flow forecasting, which improves the accuracy of the prediction by fusing results from different channels of traffic data. Our approach leverages graph convolutional network to extract spatial features from each channel while using a transformer-based architecture to capture temporal dependencies across channels. We introduce an adaptive adjacency matrix to overcome limitations in feature extraction from fixed topological structures. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that introducing a multi-channel mechanism into the temporal model enhances performance and our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, the matching of off-track HSR optical satellite stereos often encounters challenging conditions including wide-baseline observation, significant radiometric differences, multi-temporal changes, varying spatial resolutions, inconsistent spectral resolution, and diverse sensors. In this study, we evaluate various advanced feature matching algorithms for HSR optical satellite stereos. Utilizing a specially constructed dataset from five satellites across six challenging scenarios, HSROSS Dataset, we conduct a comparative analysis of four algorithms: the traditional SIFT, and deep-learning based methods including SuperPoint + SuperGlue, SuperPoint + LightGlue, and LoFTR. Our findings highlight overall superior performance of SuperPoint + LightGlue in balancing robustness, accuracy, distribution, and efficiency, showcasing its potential in complex HSR optical satellite scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is accepted as Oral Presentation in IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium(IGARSS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Context-Guided Spatial Feature Reconstruction for Efficient Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06228v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is an important task for many applications but it is still quite challenging to achieve advanced performance with limited computational costs. In this paper, we present CGRSeg, an efficient yet competitive segmentation framework based on context-guided spatial feature reconstruction. A Rectangular Self-Calibration Module is carefully designed for spatial feature reconstruction and pyramid context extraction. It captures the global context in both horizontal and vertical directions and gets the axial global context to explicitly model rectangular key areas. A shape self-calibration function is designed to make the key areas more close to the foreground object. Besides, a lightweight Dynamic Prototype Guided head is proposed to improve the classification of foreground objects by explicit class embedding. Our CGRSeg is extensively evaluated on ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and Pascal Context benchmarks, and achieves state-of-the-art semantic performance. Specifically, it achieves $43.6\%$ mIoU on ADE20K with only $4.0$ GFLOPs, which is $0.9\%$ and $2.5\%$ mIoU better than SeaFormer and SegNeXt but with about $38.0\%$ fewer GFLOPs.

| **[Aerial-NeRF: Adaptive Spatial Partitioning and Sampling for Large-Scale Aerial Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06214v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large-scale scene rendering has yielded Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)-based models with an impressive ability to synthesize scenes across small objects and indoor scenes. Nevertheless, extending this idea to large-scale aerial rendering poses two critical problems. Firstly, a single NeRF cannot render the entire scene with high-precision for complex large-scale aerial datasets since the sampling range along each view ray is insufficient to cover buildings adequately. Secondly, traditional NeRFs are infeasible to train on one GPU to enable interactive fly-throughs for modeling massive images. Instead, existing methods typically separate the whole scene into multiple regions and train a NeRF on each region, which are unaccustomed to different flight trajectories and difficult to achieve fast rendering. To that end, we propose Aerial-NeRF with three innovative modifications for jointly adapting NeRF in large-scale aerial rendering: (1) Designing an adaptive spatial partitioning and selection method based on drones' poses to adapt different flight trajectories; (2) Using similarity of poses instead of (expert) network for rendering speedup to determine which region a new viewpoint belongs to; (3) Developing an adaptive sampling approach for rendering performance improvement to cover the entire buildings at different heights. Extensive experiments have conducted to verify the effectiveness and efficiency of Aerial-NeRF, and new state-of-the-art results have been achieved on two public large-scale aerial datasets and presented SCUTic dataset. Note that our model allows us to perform rendering over 4 times as fast as compared to multiple competitors. Our dataset, code, and model are publicly available at https://drliuqi.github.io/.</p></details> |  |

More flexible spatial extremes models exhibit appealing extremal dependence properties but are often exceedingly prohibitive to fit and simulate from in high dimensions. In this paper, we aim to push the boundaries on computation and modeling of high-dimensional spatial extremes via integrating a new spatial extremes model that has flexible and non-stationary dependence properties in the encoding-decoding structure of a variational autoencoder called the XVAE. The XVAE can emulate spatial observations and produce outputs that have the same statistical properties as the inputs, especially in the tail. Our approach also provides a novel way of making fast inference with complex extreme-value processes. Through extensive simulation studies, we show that our XVAE is substantially more time-efficient than traditional Bayesian inference while outperforming many spatial extremes models with a stationary dependence structure. Lastly, we analyze a high-resolution satellite-derived dataset of sea surface temperature in the Red Sea, which includes 30 years of daily measurements at 16703 grid cells. We demonstrate how to use XVAE to identify regions susceptible to marine heatwaves under climate change and examine the spatial and temporal variability of the extremal dependence structure.</p></details> | 30 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DRSI-Net: Dual-Residual Spatial Interaction Network for Multi-Person Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16640v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-person pose estimation (MPPE), which aims to locate the key points for all persons in the frames, is an active research branch of computer vision. Variable human poses and complex scenes make MPPE dependent on local details and global structures; their absence may cause key point feature misalignment. In this case, high-order spatial interactions that can effectively link the local and global information of features are particularly important. However, most methods do not include spatial interactions. A few methods have low-order spatial interactions, but achieving a good balance between accuracy and complexity is challenging. To address the above problems, a dual-residual spatial interaction network (DRSI-Net) for MPPE with high accuracy and low complexity is proposed herein. Compared to other methods, DRSI-Net recursively performs residual spatial information interactions on the neighbouring features so that more useful spatial information can be retained and more similarities can be obtained between shallow and deep extracted features. The channel and spatial dual attention mechanism introduced in the multi-scale feature fusion also helps the network to adaptively focus on features relevant to the target key points and further refine the generated poses. Simultaneously, by optimising the interactive channel dimensions and dividing the gradient flow, the spatial interaction module is designed to be lightweight, thus reducing the complexity of the network. According to the experimental results on the COCO dataset, the proposed DRSI-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision-Language Modeling with Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks for All Weather Crosswind Landing of Aircraft](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05574v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intrinsic capability to perceive depth of field and extract salient information by the Human Vision System (HVS) stimulates a pilot to perform manual landing over an autoland approach. However, harsh weather creates visibility hindrances, and a pilot must have a clear view of runway elements before the minimum decision altitude. To help a pilot in manual landing, a vision-based system tailored to localize runway elements likewise gets affected, especially during crosswind due to the projective distortion of aircraft camera images. To combat this, we propose to integrate a prompt-based climatic diffusion network with a weather distillation model using a novel diffusion-distillation loss. Precisely, the diffusion model synthesizes climatic-conditioned landing images, and the weather distillation model learns inverse mapping by clearing those visual degradations. Then, to tackle the crosswind landing scenario, a novel Regularized Spatial Transformer Networks (RuSTaN) learns to accurately calibrate for projective distortion using self-supervised learning, which minimizes localization error by the downstream runway object detector. Finally, we have simulated a clear-day landing scenario at the busiest airport globally to curate an image-based Aircraft Landing Dataset (AIRLAD) and experimentally validated our contributions using this dataset to benchmark the performance.</p></details> |  |

While supervised methods demonstrate proficiency, their reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations limits scalability. In response to this challenge, we present an enhanced unsupervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based algorithm called DynaSeg. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on a fixed weight factor to balance feature similarity and spatial continuity, requiring manual adjustments, our novel, dynamic weighting scheme automates parameter tuning, adapting flexibly to image details. We also introduce the novel concept of a Silhouette Score Phase that addresses the challenge of dynamic clustering during iterations. Additionally, our methodology integrates both CNN-based and pre-trained ResNet feature extraction, offering a comprehensive and adaptable approach. We achieve state-of-the-art results on diverse datasets, with a notable 12.2% and 14.12% mIOU improvement compared to the current benchmarks on COCO-All and COCO-Stuff, respectively. The proposed approach unlocks the potential for unsupervised image segmentation and addresses scalability concerns in real-world scenarios by obviating the need for meticulous parameter tuning.</p></details> |  |

We propose KNN-former, which incorporates a new kind of spatial bias in attention calculation based on the K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) graph of document entities. We limit entities' attention only to their local radius defined by the KNN graph. We also use combinatorial matching to address the one-to-one mapping property that exists in many documents, where one field has only one corresponding entity. Moreover, our method is highly parameter-efficient compared to existing approaches in terms of the number of trainable parameters. Despite this, experiments across various datasets show our method outperforms baselines in most entity types. Many real-world documents exhibit combinatorial properties which can be leveraged as inductive biases to improve extraction accuracy, but existing datasets do not cover these documents. To facilitate future research into these types of documents, we release a new ID document dataset that covers diverse templates and languages. We also release enhanced annotations for an existing dataset.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we demonstrate that a newly introduced method for geostatistical modeling in the presence of anonymized point locations can be extended to account for more general kinds of positional uncertainty due to location anonymization, including both jittering (a form of random perturbations of GPS coordinates) and geomasking (reporting only the name of the area containing the true GPS coordinates). We further provide a numerical integration scheme that flexibly accounts for the positional uncertainty as well as spatial and covariate information. We apply the method to women's secondary education completion data in the 2018 Nigeria demographic and health survey (NDHS) containing jittered point locations, and the 2016 Nigeria multiple indicator cluster survey (NMICS) containing geomasked locations. We show that accounting for the positional uncertainty in the surveys can improve predictions in terms of their continuous rank probability score.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main manuscript: 31 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables; supplemental materials: 10 pages, 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In the case of complex road networks, current and past traffic information from both upstream and downstream roads are crucial since various road networks have different semantic information about traffic. Rationalizing the utilization of semantic information can realize short-term, long-term, and unseen road traffic prediction. As the demands of multi-scale traffic analysis increase, on-demand interactions and visualizations are expected to be available for transportation participants. We have designed a multi-scale traffic generation system, namely TrafficGPT, using three AI agents to process multi-scale traffic data, conduct multi-scale traffic analysis, and present multi-scale visualization results. TrafficGPT consists of three essential AI agents: 1) a text-to-demand agent that is employed with Question & Answer AI to interact with users and extract prediction tasks through texts; 2) a traffic prediction agent that leverages multi-scale traffic data to generate temporal features and similarity, and fuse them with limited spatial features and similarity, to achieve accurate prediction of three tasks; and 3) a suggestion and visualization agent that uses the prediction results to generate suggestions and visualizations, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of traffic conditions. Our TrafficGPT system focuses on addressing concerns about traffic prediction from transportation participants, and conducted extensive experiments on five real-world road datasets to demonstrate its superior predictive and interactive performance</p></details> |  |

Each voter votes for the nearest candidate, and candidates choose their strategy to maximize their votes. It is known that if there are more than two candidates, equilibria may not exist in this model. It was unknown, however, how close to an equilibrium one could get. Our work studies approximate equilibria in this model, where a strategy profile is an (additive) $\epsilon$-equilibria if no candidate can increase their votes by $\epsilon$, and provides tight or nearly-tight bounds on the approximation $\epsilon$ achievable. We show that for 3 candidates, for any distribution of the voters, $\epsilon \ge 1/12$. Thus, somewhat surprisingly, for any distribution of the voters and any strategy profile of the candidates, at least $1/12$th of the total votes is always left ``on the table.'' Extending this, we show that in the worst case, there exist voter distributions for which $\epsilon \ge 1/6$, and this is tight: one can always compute a $1/6$-approximate equilibria. We then study the general case of $m$ candidates, and show that as $m$ grows large, we get closer to an exact equilibrium: one can always obtain an $1/(m+1)$-approximate equilibria in polynomial time. We show this bound is asymptotically tight, by giving voter distributions for which $\epsilon \ge 1/(m+3)$.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Low-Depth Spatial Tree Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12953v2)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary accelerator designs exhibit a high degree of spatial localization, wherein two-dimensional physical distance determines communication costs between processing elements. This situation presents considerable algorithmic challenges, particularly when managing sparse data, a pivotal component in progressing data science. The spatial computer model quantifies communication locality by weighting processor communication costs by distance, introducing a term named energy. Moreover, it integrates depth, a widely-utilized metric, to promote high parallelism. We propose and analyze a framework for efficient spatial tree algorithms within the spatial computer model. Our primary method constructs a spatial tree layout that optimizes the locality of the neighbors in the compute grid. This approach thereby enables locality-optimized messaging within the tree. Our layout achieves a polynomial factor improvement in energy compared to utilizing a PRAM approach. Using this layout, we develop energy-efficient treefix sum and lowest common ancestor algorithms, which are both fundamental building blocks for other graph algorithms. With high probability, our algorithms exhibit near-linear energy and poly-logarithmic depth. Our contributions augment a growing body of work demonstrating that computations can have both high spatial locality and low depth. Moreover, our work constitutes an advancement in the spatial layout of irregular and sparse computations.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at IPDPS 2024</p></details> |

To prevent the accumulation of a backlog, this decoder must process syndromes from the quantum device at a faster rate than they are generated. Most prior work on real time decoding has focused on an isolated logical qubit encoded in the surface code. However, for surface code, quantum programs of utility will require multi-qubit interactions performed via lattice surgery. A large merged patch can arise during lattice surgery -- possibly as large as the entire device. This puts a significant strain on a real time decoder, which must decode errors on this merged patch and maintain the level of fault-tolerance that it achieves on isolated logical qubits. These requirements are relaxed by using spatially parallel decoding, which can be accomplished by dividing the physical qubits on the device into multiple overlapping groups and assigning a decoder module to each. We refer to this approach as spatially parallel windows. While previous work has explored similar ideas, none have addressed system-specific considerations pertinent to the task or the constraints from using hardware accelerators. In this work, we demonstrate how to configure spatially parallel windows, so that the scheme (1) is compatible with hardware accelerators, (2) supports general lattice surgery operations, (3) maintains the fidelity of the logical qubits, and (4) meets the throughput requirement for real time decoding. Furthermore, our results reveal the importance of optimally choosing the buffer width to achieve a balance between accuracy and throughput -- a decision that should be influenced by the device's physical noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tilt your Head: Activating the Hidden Spatial-Invariance of Classifiers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03730v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks are applied in more and more areas of everyday life. However, they still lack essential abilities, such as robustly dealing with spatially transformed input signals. Approaches to mitigate this severe robustness issue are limited to two pathways: Either models are implicitly regularised by increased sample variability (data augmentation) or explicitly constrained by hard-coded inductive biases. The limiting factor of the former is the size of the data space, which renders sufficient sample coverage intractable. The latter is limited by the engineering effort required to develop such inductive biases for every possible scenario. Instead, we take inspiration from human behaviour, where percepts are modified by mental or physical actions during inference. We propose a novel technique to emulate such an inference process for neural nets. This is achieved by traversing a sparsified inverse transformation tree during inference using parallel energy-based evaluations. Our proposed inference algorithm, called Inverse Transformation Search (ITS), is model-agnostic and equips the model with zero-shot pseudo-invariance to spatially transformed inputs. We evaluated our method on several benchmark datasets, including a synthesised ImageNet test set. ITS outperforms the utilised baselines on all zero-shot test scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Given an example interaction between a source object and an agent, our method can automatically infer both surface and spatial relationships for the agent and target objects within the same category, yielding more accurate and valid transfers. Specifically, our method characterizes the example interaction using a combined spatial and surface representation. We correspond the agent points and object points related to the representation to the target object space using a learned spatial and surface correspondence field, which represents objects as deformed and rotated signed distance fields. With the corresponded points, an optimization is performed under the constraints of our spatial and surface interaction representation and additional regularization. Experiments conducted on human-chair and hand-mug interaction transfer tasks show that our approach can handle larger geometry and topology variations between source and target shapes, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGGRAPH 2024, project page at https://vcc.tech/research/2024/InterTransfer</p></details> |
| **[Transformer-based RGB-T Tracking with Channel and Spatial Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03177v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complementary RGB and TIR modalities enable RGB-T tracking to achieve competitive performance in challenging scenarios. Therefore, how to better fuse cross-modal features is the core issue of RGB-T tracking. Some previous methods either insufficiently fuse RGB and TIR features, or depend on intermediaries containing information from both modalities to achieve cross-modal information interaction. The former does not fully exploit the potential of using only RGB and TIR information of the template or search region for channel and spatial feature fusion, and the latter lacks direct interaction between the template and search area, which limits the model's ability to fully exploit the original semantic information of both modalities. To alleviate these limitations, we explore how to improve the performance of a visual Transformer by using direct fusion of cross-modal channels and spatial features, and propose CSTNet. CSTNet uses ViT as a backbone and inserts cross-modal channel feature fusion modules (CFM) and cross-modal spatial feature fusion modules (SFM) for direct interaction between RGB and TIR features. The CFM performs parallel joint channel enhancement and joint multilevel spatial feature modeling of RGB and TIR features and sums the features, and then globally integrates the sum feature with the original features. The SFM uses cross-attention to model the spatial relationship of cross-modal features and then introduces a convolutional feedforward network for joint spatial and channel integration of multimodal features. Comprehensive experiments show that CSTNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on three public RGB-T tracking benchmarks.

The enumeration of manipulators is done by using adjacency matrix concept. In this paper, a novel way of applying adjacency matrix to spatial manipulators with four types of joints, namely revolute, prismatic, cylindrical and spherical joints, is presented. The limitations of the applicability of the concept to 3D manipulators are discussed. 1-DOF (Degree Of Freedom) manipulators of four links and 2-DOF, 3-DOF and 4-DOF manipulators of three links, four links and five links, are enumerated based on a set of conventions and some assumptions. Finally, 96 1-DOF manipulators of four links, 641 2-DOF manipulators of 5 links, 4 2-DOF manipulators of three links, 8 3-DOF manipulators of four links and 15 4-DOF manipulators of five links are presented.</p></details> |  |

The second module, a texture transformer network, enhances the resolution of each light field perspective independently using the output of the first module as a reference image. The final module leverages light field regularity to jointly improve resolution across all LF image perspectives.

The study of criminal trajectories aims to understand the beginning, persistence and desistence in crime, providing intriguing explanations about these moments in life. Central to this analysis is the identification of patterns in the frequency of criminal victimization and recidivism, along with the factors that contribute to them. Specifically, this work introduces a new class of models that overcome limitations in traditional methods used to analyze criminal recidivism. These models are designed for recurrent events data characterized by excess of zeros and spatial correlation. They extend the Non-Homogeneous Poisson Process, incorporating spatial dependence in the model through random effects, enabling the analysis of associations among individuals within the same spatial stratum. To deal with the excess of zeros in the data, a zero-inflated Poisson mixed model was incorporated. In addition to parametric models following the Power Law process for baseline intensity functions, we propose flexible semi-parametric versions approximating the intensity function using Bernstein Polynomials. The Bayesian approach offers advantages such as incorporating external evidence and modeling specific correlations between random effects and observed data. The performance of these models was evaluated in a simulation study with various scenarios, and we applied them to analyze criminal recidivism data in the Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte, Brazil. The results provide a detailed analysis of high-risk areas for recurrent crimes and the behavior of recidivism rates over time. This research significantly enhances our understanding of criminal trajectories, paving the way for more effective strategies in combating criminal recidivism.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 12 figuras and 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Heterogeneous Additive Partial Linear Model: A Joint Approach of Bivariate Spline and Forest Lasso](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11579v2)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying spatial heterogeneous patterns has attracted a surge of research interest in recent years, due to its important applications in various scientific and engineering fields. In practice the spatially heterogeneous components are often mixed with components which are spatially smooth, making the task of identifying the heterogeneous regions more challenging. In this paper, we develop an efficient clustering approach to identify the model heterogeneity of the spatial additive partial linear model. Specifically, we aim to detect the spatially contiguous clusters based on the regression coefficients while introducing a spatially varying intercept to deal with the smooth spatial effect. On the one hand, to approximate the spatial varying intercept, we use the method of bivariate spline over triangulation, which can effectively handle the data from a complex domain. On the other hand, a novel fusion penalty termed the forest lasso is proposed to reveal the spatial clustering pattern. Our proposed fusion penalty has advantages in both the estimation and computation efficiencies when dealing with large spatial data. Theoretically properties of our estimator are established, and simulation results show that our approach can achieve more accurate estimation with a limited computation cost compared with the existing approaches. To illustrate its practical use, we apply our approach to analyze the spatial pattern of the relationship between land surface temperature measured by satellites and air temperature measured by ground stations in the United States.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, this paper presents a novel trajectory prediction model tailored for accuracy in the face of heterogeneous and uncertain traffic scenarios. At the heart of this model lies the Characterized Diffusion Module, an innovative module designed to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty. This module enriches the predictive process by infusing it with detailed semantic information, thereby enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy. Complementing this, our Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module captures the nuanced effects of traffic scenarios on vehicle dynamics across both spatial and temporal dimensions with remarkable effectiveness. Demonstrated through exhaustive evaluations, our model sets a new standard in trajectory prediction, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) datasets across both short and extended temporal spans. This performance underscores the model's unparalleled adaptability and efficacy in navigating complex traffic scenarios, including highways, urban streets, and intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[SFFNet: A Wavelet-Based Spatial and Frequency Domain Fusion Network for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01992v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to fully utilize spatial information for segmentation and address the challenge of handling areas with significant grayscale variations in remote sensing segmentation, we propose the SFFNet (Spatial and Frequency Domain Fusion Network) framework. This framework employs a two-stage network design: the first stage extracts features using spatial methods to obtain features with sufficient spatial details and semantic information; the second stage maps these features in both spatial and frequency domains. In the frequency domain mapping, we introduce the Wavelet Transform Feature Decomposer (WTFD) structure, which decomposes features into low-frequency and high-frequency components using the Haar wavelet transform and integrates them with spatial features. To bridge the semantic gap between frequency and spatial features, and facilitate significant feature selection to promote the combination of features from different representation domains, we design the Multiscale Dual-Representation Alignment Filter (MDAF). This structure utilizes multiscale convolutions and dual-cross attentions. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared to existing methods, SFFNet achieves superior performance in terms of mIoU, reaching 84.80% and 87.73% respectively.The code is located at https://github.com/yysdck/SFFNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[JPEG Quantized Coefficient Recovery via DCT Domain Spatial-Frequential Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09110v2)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>JPEG compression adopts the quantization of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients for effective bit-rate reduction, whilst the quantization could lead to a significant loss of important image details. Recovering compressed JPEG images in the frequency domain has recently garnered increasing interest, complementing the multitude of restoration techniques established in the pixel domain. However, existing DCT domain methods typically suffer from limited effectiveness in handling a wide range of compression quality factors or fall short in recovering sparse quantized coefficients and the components across different colorspaces. To address these challenges, we propose a DCT domain spatial-frequential Transformer, namely DCTransformer, for JPEG quantized coefficient recovery. Specifically, a dual-branch architecture is designed to capture both spatial and frequential correlations within the collocated DCT coefficients. Moreover, we incorporate the operation of quantization matrix embedding, which effectively allows our single model to handle a wide range of quality factors, and a luminance-chrominance alignment head that produces a unified feature map to align different-sized luminance and chrominance components. Our proposed DCTransformer outperforms the current state-of-the-art JPEG artifact removal techniques, as demonstrated by our extensive experiments.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |
| **[PipeOrgan: Efficient Inter-operation Pipelining with Flexible Spatial Organization and Interconnects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01736v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Because of the recent trends in Deep Neural Networks (DNN) models being memory-bound, inter-operator pipelining for DNN accelerators is emerging as a promising optimization. Inter-operator pipelining reduces costly on-chip global memory and off-chip memory accesses by forwarding the output of a layer as the input of the next layer within the compute array, which is proven to be an effective optimization by previous works. However, the design space of inter-operator pipelining is huge, and the space is not yet fully explored. In particular, identifying the right depth and granularity of pipelining (or no pipelining at all) is significantly dependent on the layer shapes and data volumes of weights and activations, and these are different even within a domain. Moreover, works divide the substrate into large chunks and map one layer onto each chunk, which requires communicating halfway through or through the global buffer. However, for fine-grained inter-operation pipelining, placing the corresponding consumer of the next layer tile close to the producer tile of the current layer is a better way to exploit fine-grained spatial reuse. In order to support variable number of layers (ie the right depth) and support multiple spatial organizations of layers (in accordance with the pipelining granularity) on the substrate, we propose PipeOrgan, a new class of spatial data organization strategy for energy efficient and congestion-free communication between the PEs for various pipeline depth and granularity. PipeOrgan takes advantage of flexible spatial organization and can allocate layers to PEs based on the granularity of pipelining. We also propose changes to the conventional mesh topology to improve the performance of coarse-grained allocation. PipeOrgan achieves 1.95x performance improvement over the state-of-the-art pipelined dataflow on XR-bench workloads.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, despite impressive results shown by the mass literature, developers often find it hard to ensure the safe deployment of these learning-based perception models. Attributing the challenge to the lack of safety-oriented metrics, we hereby present uncompromising spatial constraints (USC), which characterize a simple yet important localization requirement demanding the predictions to fully cover the objects when seen from the autonomous vehicle. The constraints, as we formulate using the perspective and bird's-eye views, can be naturally reflected by quantitative measures, such that having an object detector with a higher score implies a lower risk of collision. Finally, beyond model evaluation, we incorporate the quantitative measures into common loss functions to enable safety-oriented fine-tuning for existing models. With experiments using the nuScenes dataset and a closed-loop simulation, our work demonstrates such considerations of safety notions at the perception level not only improve model performances beyond accuracy but also allow for a more direct linkage to actual system safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages (IEEE double column format), 7 figures, 2 tables, submitted to ITSC 2024</p></details> |

Despite decades of research, BCIs are not fully integrated into clinical and commercial settings. It's crucial to assess and explain BCI performance, offering clear explanations for potential users to avoid frustration when it doesn't work as expected. This work investigates the efficacy of different deep learning and Riemannian geometry-based classification models in the context of motor imagery (MI) based BCI using electroencephalography (EEG). We then propose an optimal transport theory-based approach using earth mover's distance (EMD) to quantify the comparison of the feature relevance map with the domain knowledge of neuroscience. For this, we utilized explainable AI (XAI) techniques for generating feature relevance in the spatial domain to identify important channels for model outcomes. Three state-of-the-art models are implemented - 1) Riemannian geometry-based classifier, 2) EEGNet, and 3) EEG Conformer, and the observed trend in the model's accuracy across different architectures on the dataset correlates with the proposed feature relevance metrics. The models with diverse architectures perform significantly better when trained on channels relevant to motor imagery than data-driven channel selection.

Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the US, which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood hematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukemia and lymphoma.</p></details> |  |

While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Efficient Spatio-Temporal Lifetime Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06443v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are vital assets for the reliable and efficient operation of power and energy systems. They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Despite significant strides in ST modeling in recent years, there remains a need to emphasize harnessing the potential of information from different modalities. Robust MoST forecasting is more challenging because it possesses (i) high-dimensional and complex internal structures and (ii) dynamic heterogeneity caused by temporal, spatial, and modality variations. In this study, we propose a novel MoST learning framework via Self-Supervised Learning, namely MoSSL, which aims to uncover latent patterns from temporal, spatial, and modality perspectives while quantifying dynamic heterogeneity. Experiment results on two real-world MoST datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

As one of the important application domains of foundation models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture, earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation models. Specifically, for transfer learning of the land cover downstream task on the PhilEO Bench dataset, it shows 10.4\% higher accuracy compared with other geospatial foundation models on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint covariance properties under geometric image transformations for spatio-temporal receptive fields according to the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10543v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of natural image transformations on receptive field responses is crucial for modelling visual operations in computer vision and biological vision. In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations, which make it possible to characterize how different types of image transformations interact with each other and the associated spatio-temporal receptive field responses. In this regard, we also extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, to be able to obtain true affine-covariant properties of spatial derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels. The derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. As a side effect, the presented proof for the joint covariance property over the integrated combination of the different geometric image transformations also provides specific proofs for the individual transformation properties, which have not previously been fully reported in the literature. The paper also presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of geometric interpretations of the derived covariance properties, as well as outlines a number of biological interpretations of these results.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 13 figures.

In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p></details> |  |

However, there is need to ensure the judicious utilization of allocated bandwidth without compromising the Quality of Service (QoS) of the system. In this regard, this paper presents an approach based on spatio-temporal frame indexing that detects and eliminate redundancy within and across captured frame, prior transmission from the server to clients. The standard and local low motion videos were the two scenarios considered in evaluating the performance of the proposed algorithm. Results obtained showed that the proposed approach achieved an improvement of 5.13%, 15.8% and 5%, 15.6% improvement in terms of the buffer size and compression ratio. Though with a tradeoff of the frame-built time, where both the standard and local frame indexing outperforms the proposed scheme with 10.8% and 8.71% respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our work primarily addresses this, introducing more realistic and flexible models for spatio-temporal random fields. We break away from the traditional confines of the classic frozen field by either relaxing the assumption of a single deterministic velocity or rethinking the hypothesis regarding the spectrum shape, thus enhancing the realism of our models. While the proposed models stand out for their realism and flexibility, they are also paired with simulation algorithms that are equally or less computationally complex than the commonly used circulant embedding for Gaussian random fields in $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. This combination of realistic modeling with efficient simulation methods creates an effective solution for better understanding traveling phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

The knowledge tree enables the visualization of hierarchical interrelation within the STKG, while the knowledge net elucidates semantic relationships among knowledge entities. Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods. Moreover, we have encapsulated this technology within an integrated, open-source platform named GeoViz.

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Machine Learning meets Formal Methods: An application to spatio-temporal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01360v3)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an interdisciplinary framework that combines Bayesian predictive inference, a well-established tool in Machine Learning, with Formal Methods rooted in the computer science community. Bayesian predictive inference allows for coherently incorporating uncertainty about unknown quantities by making use of methods or models that produce predictive distributions, which in turn inform decision problems. By formalizing these decision problems into properties with the help of spatio-temporal logic, we can formulate and predict how likely such properties are to be satisfied in the future at a certain location. Moreover, we can leverage our methodology to evaluate and compare models directly on their ability to predict the satisfaction of application-driven properties. The approach is illustrated in an urban mobility application, where the crowdedness in the center of Milan is proxied by aggregated mobile phone traffic data. We specify several desirable spatio-temporal properties related to city crowdedness such as a fault-tolerant network or the reachability of hospitals. After verifying these properties on draws from the posterior predictive distributions, we compare several spatio-temporal Bayesian models based on their overall and property-based predictive performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Discriminative Spatio-temporal Representations for Semi-supervised Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16416v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised action recognition aims to improve spatio-temporal reasoning ability with a few labeled data in conjunction with a large amount of unlabeled data. Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone to making ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as the limitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the model two aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporal structure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. It assesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of the labeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from a pseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlight informative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into the short-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of these two new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the model to make accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics400 show the superiority of our method over prior state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, 56 conferences</p></details> |

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the ACM for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279v2)** | 2024-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Unified Replay-based Continuous Learning Framework for Spatio-Temporal Prediction on Streaming Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14999v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of wireless and mobile devices results in a proliferation of spatio-temporal data that is used in applications, e.g., traffic prediction, human mobility mining, and air quality prediction, where spatio-temporal prediction is often essential to enable safety, predictability, or reliability. Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[ICST-DNET: An Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network for Traffic Speed Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13853v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Typical fine-tuning based adaptation paradigm is prone to overfitting in the few-shot learning scenarios and offers little modeling flexibility for learning temporal features in video data. In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), which is a novel adapter tuning framework well-suited for few-shot action recognition due to lightweight design and low parameter-learning overhead. It is designed in a dual-pathway architecture to encode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner. In particular, we devise the anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention module as the core component of D$^2$ST-Adapter, which can be tailored with anisotropic sampling densities along spatial and temporal domains to learn spatial and temporal features specifically in corresponding pathways, allowing our D$^2$ST-Adapter to encode features in a global view in 3D spatio-temporal space while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments with instantiations of our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods for few-shot action recognition. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Joint Analysis of PM2.5 and Ozone in California with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14446v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The substantial threat of concurrent air pollutants to public health is increasingly severe under climate change. To identify the common drivers and extent of spatio-temporal similarity of PM2.5 and ozone, this paper proposed a log Gaussian-Gumbel Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for sharing a SPDE-AR(1) spatio-temporal interaction structure. The proposed model outperforms in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction capacity for its increased parsimony and reduced uncertainty, especially for the shared ozone sub-model. Besides the consistently significant influence of temperature (positive), extreme drought (positive), fire burnt area (positive), and wind speed (negative) on both PM2.5 and ozone, surface pressure and GDP per capita (precipitation) demonstrate only positive associations with PM2.5 (ozone), while population density relates to neither. In addition, our results show the distinct spatio-temporal interactions and different seasonal patterns of PM2.5 and ozone, with peaks of PM2.5 and ozone in cold and hot seasons, respectively. Finally, with the aid of the excursion function, we see that the areas around the intersection of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are likely to exceed the unhealthy ozone level for sensitive groups throughout the year. Our findings provide new insights for regional and seasonal strategies in the co-control of PM2.5 and ozone. Our methodology is expected to be utilized when interest lies in multiple interrelated processes in the fields of environment and epidemiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[DST-GTN: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11996v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for effective urban planning and congestion management. Deep learning (DL) approaches have gained colossal success in traffic forecasting but still face challenges in capturing the intricacies of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we identify and address this challenges by emphasizing that spatial features are inherently dynamic and change over time. A novel in-depth feature representation, called Dynamic Spatio-Temporal (Dyn-ST) features, is introduced, which encapsulates spatial characteristics across varying times. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network (DST-GTN) is proposed by capturing Dyn-ST features and other dynamic adjacency relations between intersections. The DST-GTN can model dynamic ST relationships between nodes accurately and refine the representation of global and local ST characteristics by adopting adaptive weights in low-pass and all-pass filters, enabling the extraction of Dyn-ST features from traffic time-series data. Through numerical experiments on public datasets, the DST-GTN achieves state-of-the-art performance for a range of traffic forecasting tasks and demonstrates enhanced stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal patterns of diurnal temperature: a random matrix approach I-case of India](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11747v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the spatio-temporal gridded daily diurnal temperature range (DTR) data across India during the 72-year period 1951--2022. We augment this data with information on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and on the climatic regions (Stamp's and Koeppen's classification) and four seasons of India. We use various matrix theory approaches to trim out strong but routine signals, random matrix theory to remove noise, and novel empirical generalised singular-value distributions to establish retention of essential signals in the trimmed data. We make use of the spatial Bergsma statistics to measure spatial association and identify temporal change points in the spatial-association. In particular, our investigation captures a yet unknown change-point over the 72 years under study with drastic changes in spatial-association of DTR in India. It also brings out changes in spatial association with regard to ENSO. We conclude that while studying/modelling Indian DTR data, due consideration should be granted to the strong spatial association that is being persistently exhibited over decades, and provision should be kept for potential change points in the temporal behaviour, which in turn can bring moderate to dramatic changes in the spatial association pattern. Some of our analysis also reaffirms the conclusions made by other authors, regarding spatial and temporal behavior of DTR, adding our own insights. We consider the data from the yearly, seasonal and climatic zones points of view, and discover several new and interesting statistical structures which should be of interest, especially to climatologists and statisticians.

| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervision for LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11737v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular representation learning methods encourage feature invariance under transformations applied at the input. However, in 3D perception tasks like object localization and segmentation, outputs are naturally equivariant to some transformations, such as rotation. Using pre-training loss functions that encourage equivariance of features under certain transformations provides a strong self-supervision signal while also retaining information of geometric relationships between transformed feature representations. This can enable improved performance in downstream tasks that are equivariant to such transformations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal equivariant learning framework by considering both spatial and temporal augmentations jointly. Our experiments show that the best performance arises with a pre-training approach that encourages equivariance to translation, scaling, and flip, rotation and scene flow. For spatial augmentations, we find that depending on the transformation, either a contrastive objective or an equivariance-by-classification objective yields best results. To leverage real-world object deformations and motion, we consider sequential LiDAR scene pairs and develop a novel 3D scene flow-based equivariance objective that leads to improved performance overall. We show our pre-training method for 3D object detection which outperforms existing equivariant and invariant approaches in many settings.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos/code available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatio-temporal model to detect potential outliers in disease mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09882v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal disease mapping models are commonly used to estimate the relative risk of a disease over time and across areas. For each area and time point, the disease count is modelled with a Poisson distribution whose mean is the product of an offset and the disease relative risk. This relative risk is commonly decomposed in the log scale as the sum of fixed and latent effects. The Rushworth model allows for spatio-temporal autocorrelation of the random effects. We build on the Rushworth model to accommodate and identify potentially outlying areas with respect to their disease relative risk evolution, after taking into account the fixed effects. An area may display outlying behaviour at some points in time but not all. At each time point, we assume the latent effects to be spatially structured and include scaling parameters in the precision matrix, to allow for heavy-tails. Two prior specifications are considered for the scaling parameters: one where they are independent across space and one with spatial autocorrelation. We investigate the performance of the different prior specifications of the proposed model through simulation studies and analyse the weekly evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases across the 33 boroughs of Montreal and the 96 French departments during the second wave. In Montreal, 6 boroughs are found to be potentially outlying. In France, the model with spatially structured scaling parameters identified 21 departments as potential outliers. We find that these departments tend to be close to each other and within common French regions.</p></details> |  |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChangeMamba: Remote Sensing Change Detection with Spatio-Temporal State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03425v3)** | 2024-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have made impressive progress in the field of remote sensing change detection (CD). However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.11% SeK; and on the BDA dataset xBD, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data. The source code will be available in https://github.com/ChenHongruixuan/MambaCD</p></details> |  |

Addressing this distinctive attribute, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal CNN-Transformer network (MSSTNet). Our approach takes spatial features of different scales extracted by CNN and feeds them into a Multi-scale Embedding Layer (MELayer). The MELayer extracts multi-scale spatial information and encodes these features before sending them into a Temporal Transformer (T-Former). The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07919v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in real-world dynamic systems, predicting future changes using historical data from diverse locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing prescribed spatio-temporal marginals of stopped particles. In the context of control, we seek the control action directing the stochastic flow toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is, once again, available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of the framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding control action takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |
| **[PASTA: Towards Flexible and Efficient HDR Imaging Via Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10376v2)** | 2024-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging Transformer attention has led to great advancements in HDR deghosting. However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection via Spatio-Temporal Pseudo-Anomaly Generation : A Unified Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16514v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is an open-set recognition task, which is usually formulated as a one-class classification (OCC) problem, where training data is comprised of videos with normal instances while test data contains both normal and anomalous instances. Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |

While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + appendix (21 pages total)</p></details> |

This paper addresses a critical limitation in current video grounding methodologies by introducing an Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task. Unlike prevalent closed-set approaches that struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to limited training data and predefined vocabularies, our model leverages pre-trained representations from foundational spatial grounding models. This empowers it to effectively bridge the semantic gap between natural language and diverse visual content, achieving strong performance in closed-set and open-vocabulary settings. Our contributions include a novel spatio-temporal video grounding model, surpassing state-of-the-art results in closed-set evaluations on multiple datasets and demonstrating superior performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Notably, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in closed-set settings on VidSTG (Declarative and Interrogative) and HC-STVG (V1 and V2) datasets. Furthermore, in open-vocabulary evaluations on HC-STVG V1 and YouCook-Interactions, our model surpasses the recent best-performing models by $4.88$ m_vIoU and $1.83\%$ accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling diverse linguistic and visual concepts for improved video understanding.

Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach.

To correctly exploit the provided information by each sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure.

There is increasing interest in achieving 24/7 Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) matching in electricity usage, aiming to eliminate all carbon footprints associated with electricity consumption on an hourly basis. However, the variability of renewable energy resources poses significant challenges for achieving this goal. We explore the impact of shifting computing jobs and associated power loads both in time and between datacenter locations. We develop an optimization model to simulate a network of geographically distributed datacenters managed by a company leveraging spatio-temporal load flexibility to achieve 24/7 CFE matching. We isolate three signals relevant for informed use of load flexiblity: varying average quality of renewable energy resources, low correlation between wind power generation over long distances due to different weather conditions, and lags in solar radiation peak due to Earth's rotation. We illustrate that the location of datacenters and the time of year affect which signal drives an effective load-shaping strategy. The energy procurement and load-shifting decisions based on informed use of these signals facilitate the resource-efficiency and cost-effectiveness of clean computing -- the costs of 24/7 CFE are reduced by 1.29$\pm$0.07 EUR/MWh for every additional percentage of flexible load. We provide practical guidelines on how companies with datacenters can leverage spatio-temporal load flexibility for truly clean computing. Our results and the open-source optimization model can also be useful for a broader variety of companies with flexible loads and an interest in eliminating their carbon footprint.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Few-Shot Learning via Diffusive Neural Network Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11922v3)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal modeling is foundational for smart city applications, yet it is often hindered by data scarcity in many cities and regions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction.

Malicious users can easily create non-existent videos to spread false information. This letter proposes an effective AI-generated video detection (AIGVDet) scheme by capturing the forensic traces with a two-branch spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, two ResNet sub-detectors are learned separately for identifying the anomalies in spatical and optical flow domains, respectively. Results of such sub-detectors are fused to further enhance the discrimination ability. A large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) is constructed as a benchmark for model training and evaluation. Extensive experimental results verify the high generalization and robustness of our AIGVDet scheme. Code and dataset will be available at https://github.com/multimediaFor/AIGVDet.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is based on learning a 3D spatio-spatial temporal convolution to create detailed pictures of forehead patterns. We introduce a new CNN model called the Forehead Spatio-Spatial Temporal Network (FH-SSTNet), which utilizes a 3D CNN architecture with triplet loss to capture distinguishing features. We enhance the model's discrimination capability using Arcloss in the network's head. Experimentation on the Forehead Creases version 1 (FH-V1) dataset, containing 247 unique subjects, demonstrates the superior performance of FH-SSTNet compared to existing methods and pre-trained CNNs like ResNet50, especially for forehead-based user verification. The results demonstrate the superior performance of FH-SSTNet for forehead-based user verification, confirming its effectiveness in identity authentication.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 Figure, IWBF conference</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network for Facial Expression Spotting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15994v1)** | 2024-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Facial expression spotting is a significant but challenging task in facial expression analysis. The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p></details> | Accepted by FG2024 |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Bi-directional Cross-frame Memory for Distractor Filtering Point Cloud Single Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15831v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D single object tracking within LIDAR point clouds is a pivotal task in computer vision, with profound implications for autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |

PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[$GRU^{spa}$: Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention for Spatio-Temporal Disaggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07292v3)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open data is frequently released spatially aggregated, usually to comply with privacy policies. But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose a model, Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention ($GRU^{spa}$), where spatial attention layers are integrated into the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Additionally, we utilize containment relationships between different geographic levels (e.g., when a given city block is wholly contained in a given census tract) to constrain the spatial attention layers. For situations where limited historical training data is available, we study transfer learning scenarios and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that $GRU^{spa}$ provides a significant improvement over other neural models as well as typical heuristic methods, allowing us to synthesize realistic point data over small regions useful for training downstream models.</p></details> |  |

Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations. Through quantitative and qualitative analysis, we show a spatio-temporal relationship within ECG data.

In the upstream stage, we design a vector quantization reconstruction module with temporal evolution characteristics, ensuring balanced and resilient parameter distribution by introducing general physical constraints. In the downstream stage, a diffusion probability network involving parameters is utilized to generate high-quality future states of fluids, while enhancing the model's generalization ability by perceiving parameters in various physical setups. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets have verified the effectiveness and robustness of the ST-PAD framework, which showcase that ST-PAD outperforms current mainstream models in fluid dynamics modeling and prediction, especially in effectively capturing local representations and maintaining significant advantages in OOD generations.</p></details> |  |

Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline.</p></details> |  |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |

It automatically decomposes the given task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, and thus enables sparse decision-making and focused computation on the relevant parts of the environment. The decomposition relies on the extraction of an abstracted proxy problem represented as a directed graph, in which vertices and edges are learned end-to-end from hindsight. Our theoretical analyses provide performance guarantees under appropriate assumptions and establish where our approach is expected to be helpful. Generalization-focused experiments validate Skipper's significant advantage in zero-shot generalization, compared to some existing state-of-the-art hierarchical planning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Camera-Ready</p></details> |

| **[Bayesian Design for Sampling Anomalous Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10791v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data collected from arrays of sensors are essential for informed decision-making in various systems. However, the presence of anomalies can compromise the accuracy and reliability of insights drawn from the collected data or information obtained via statistical analysis. This study aims to develop a robust Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) framework with anomaly detection methods for high-quality data collection. We introduce a general framework that involves anomaly generation, detection and error scoring when searching for an optimal design. This method is demonstrated using two comprehensive simulated case studies: the first study uses a spatial dataset, and the second uses a spatio-temporal river network dataset. As a baseline approach, we employed a commonly used prediction-based utility function based on minimising errors. Results illustrate the trade-off between predictive accuracy and anomaly detection performance for our method under various design scenarios. An optimal design robust to anomalies ensures the collection and analysis of more trustworthy data, playing a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of complex systems such as the environment, therefore enabling informed decisions in monitoring, management, and response.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Occupancy Models with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10680v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern methods for quantifying and predicting species distribution play a crucial part in biodiversity conservation. Occupancy models are a popular choice for analyzing species occurrence data as they allow to separate the observational error induced by imperfect detection, and the sources of bias affecting the occupancy process. However, the spatial and temporal variation in occupancy not accounted for by environmental covariates is often ignored or modelled through simple spatial structures as the computational costs of fitting explicit spatio-temporal models is too high. In this work, we demonstrate how INLA may be used to fit complex occupancy models and how the R-INLA package can provide a user-friendly interface to make such complex models available to users. We show how occupancy models, provided some simplification on the detection process, can be framed as latent Gaussian models and benefit from the powerful INLA machinery. A large selection of complex modelling features, and random effect modelshave already been implemented in R-INLA. These become available for occupancy models, providing the user with an efficient and flexible toolbox. We illustrate how INLA provides a computationally efficient framework for developing and fitting complex occupancy models using two case studies. Through these, we show how different spatio-temporal models that include spatial-varying trends, smooth terms, and spatio-temporal random effects can be fitted. At the cost of limiting the complexity of the detection model, INLA can incorporate a range of complex structures in the process. INLA-based occupancy models provide an alternative framework to fit complex spatiotemporal occupancy models. The need for new and more flexible computationally approaches to fit such models makes INLA an attractive option for addressing complex ecological problems, and a promising area of research.</p></details> |  |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared interactions to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal interactions between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models with flexible shared interaction outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models with independent interactions. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative healthcare districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 39 pages, 12 figures |

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its accurate segmentation and zero-shot generalization, has not yet been tailored for CMR 2D+T segmentation. We therefore introduce CMR2D+T-SAM, a novel approach to adapt SAM for CMR 2D+T segmentation using spatio-temporal adaption. This approach also incorporates a U-Net framework for multi-scale feature extraction, as well as text prompts for accurate segmentation on both short-axis (SAX) and long-axis (LAX) views using a single model. CMR2D+T-SAM outperforms existing deep learning methods on the STACOM2011 dataset, achieving a myocardium Dice score of 0.885 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.900 pixels.

| **[Autoregressive Queries for Adaptive Tracking with Spatio-TemporalTransformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10574v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rich spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture the complicated target appearance variations in visual tracking. However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal methods for estimating subsurface ocean thermal response to tropical cyclones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15130v5)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tropical cyclones (TCs), driven by heat exchange between the air and sea, pose a substantial risk to many communities around the world. Accurate characterization of the subsurface ocean thermal response to TC passage is crucial for accurate TC intensity forecasts and for an understanding of the role that TCs play in the global climate system. However, that characterization is complicated by the high-noise ocean environment, correlations inherent in spatio-temporal data, relative scarcity of in situ observations, and the entanglement of the TC-induced signal with seasonal signals. We present a general methodological framework that addresses these difficulties, integrating existing techniques in seasonal mean field estimation, Gaussian process modeling, and nonparametric regression into an ANOVA decomposition model. Importantly, we improve upon past work by properly handling seasonality, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification, and treating time as a continuous variable, rather than producing estimates that are binned in time. This ANOVA model is estimated using in situ subsurface temperature profiles from the Argo fleet of autonomous floats through a multi-step procedure, which (1) characterizes the upper ocean seasonal shift during the TC season; (2) models the variability in the temperature observations; (3) fits a thin plate spline using the variability estimates to account for heteroskedasticity and correlation between the observations. This spline fit reveals the ocean thermal response to TC passage. Through this framework, we obtain new scientific insights into the interaction between TCs and the ocean on a global scale, including a three-dimensional characterization of the near-surface and subsurface cooling along the TC storm track and the mixing-induced subsurface warming on the track's right side.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures; supplement and code at https://github.com/huisaddison/tc-ocean-methods</p></details> |

During training, CINA learns a general representation of the fetal brain and encodes subject specific information into latent code. After training, CINA can construct a faithful atlas with tissue probability maps of the fetal brain for any gestational age (GA) and anatomical variation covered within the training domain. Thus, CINA is competent to represent both, neurotypical and pathological brains. Furthermore, a trained CINA model can be fit to brain MRI of unseen subjects via test-time optimization of the latent code. CINA can then produce probabilistic tissue maps tailored to a particular subject. We evaluate our method on a total of 198 T2 weighted MRI of normal and abnormal fetal brains from the dHCP and FeTA datasets. We demonstrate CINA's capability to represent a fetal brain atlas that can be flexibly conditioned on GA and on anatomical variations like ventricular volume or degree of cortical folding, making it a suitable tool for modeling both neurotypical and pathological brains. We quantify the fidelity of our atlas by means of tissue segmentation and age prediction and compare it to an established baseline. CINA demonstrates superior accuracy for neurotypical brains and pathological brains with ventriculomegaly. Moreover, CINA scores a mean absolute error of 0.23 weeks in fetal brain age prediction, further confirming an accurate representation of fetal brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[JSTR: Joint Spatio-Temporal Reasoning for Event-based Moving Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07436v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based moving object detection is a challenging task, where static background and moving object are mixed together. Typically, existing methods mainly align the background events to the same spatial coordinate system via motion compensation to distinguish the moving object. However, they neglect the potential spatial tailing effect of moving object events caused by excessive motion, which may affect the structure integrity of the extracted moving object. We discover that the moving object has a complete columnar structure in the point cloud composed of motion-compensated events along the timestamp. Motivated by this, we propose a novel joint spatio-temporal reasoning method for event-based moving object detection. Specifically, we first compensate the motion of background events using inertial measurement unit. In spatial reasoning stage, we project the compensated events into the same image coordinate, discretize the timestamp of events to obtain a time image that can reflect the motion confidence, and further segment the moving object through adaptive threshold on the time image. In temporal reasoning stage, we construct the events into a point cloud along timestamp, and use RANSAC algorithm to extract the columnar shape in the cloud for peeling off the background. Finally, we fuse the results from the two reasoning stages to extract the final moving object region. This joint spatio-temporal reasoning framework can effectively detect the moving object from motion confidence and geometric structure. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to verify that the proposed method can improve the moving object detection accuracy by 13\%.</p></details> |  |

This theoretical result can be employed as an estimation method to derive parameter estimates for a particular model assumed for the data. The underlying motivation is to avoid the difficulties associated with dealing with complex likelihoods in point process models and their maximization. The exploited result makes our method theoretically applicable to any model specification. In this paper, we restrict our study to Poisson models, whose likelihood represents the base for many more complex point process models. In this context, our proposed method can estimate the vector of local parameters that correspond to the points within the analyzed point pattern without introducing any additional complexity compared to the global estimation. We illustrate the method through simulation studies for both purely spatial and spatio-temporal point processes and show complex scenarios based on the Poisson model through the analysis of two real datasets concerning environmental problems.</p></details> |  |

Tangible cubes, with their rich interaction affordances, high maneuverability, and stable structure, are particularly well-suited for exploring multi-dimensional data types. However, the design potential of these cubes is underexplored. This study introduces a design space for tangible cubes in MR, focusing on interaction space, visualization space, sizes, and multiplicity. Using spatio-temporal data, we explored the interaction affordances of these cubes in a workshop (N=24). We identified unique interactions like rotating, tapping, and stacking, which are linked to augmented reality (AR) visualization commands. Integrating user-identified interactions, we created a design space for tangible-cube interactions and visualization. A prototype visualizing global health spending with small cubes was developed and evaluated, supporting both individual and combined cube manipulation. This research enhances our grasp of tangible interaction in MR, offering insights for future design and application in diverse data contexts.</p></details> |  |

Temporal localization is challenging because it requires robustness, reliability, and accuracy. In this study, we aim to improve the temporal localization and classification accuracy performance by adapting video action recognition and 2D human-pose estimation networks to one model. Therefore, we design a transformer-based fusion architecture to effectively combine 2D-pose features and spatio-temporal features. The model uses 2D-pose features as the positional embedding of the transformer architecture and spatio-temporal features as the main input to the encoder of the transformer. The proposed solution is generic and independent of the camera numbers and positions, giving frame-based class probabilities as output. Finally, the post-processing step combines information from different camera views to obtain final predictions and eliminate false positives. The model performs well on the A2 test set of the 2023 NVIDIA AI City Challenge for naturalistic driving action recognition, achieving the overlap score of the organizer-defined distracted driver behaviour metric of 0.5079.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding Via Spatio-Temporal Virtual Grid for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06433v1)** | 2024-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing high-performance, real-time architectures for LiDAR-based 3D object detectors is essential for the successful commercialization of autonomous vehicles. Pillar-based methods stand out as a practical choice for onboard deployment due to their computational efficiency. However, despite their efficiency, these methods can sometimes underperform compared to alternative point encoding techniques such as Voxel-encoding or PointNet++. We argue that current pillar-based methods have not sufficiently captured the fine-grained distributions of LiDAR points within each pillar structure. Consequently, there exists considerable room for improvement in pillar feature encoding. In this paper, we introduce a novel pillar encoding architecture referred to as Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding (FG-PFE). FG-PFE utilizes Spatio-Temporal Virtual (STV) grids to capture the distribution of point clouds within each pillar across vertical, temporal, and horizontal dimensions. Through STV grids, points within each pillar are individually encoded using Vertical PFE (V-PFE), Temporal PFE (T-PFE), and Horizontal PFE (H-PFE). These encoded features are then aggregated through an Attentive Pillar Aggregation method. Our experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that FG-PFE achieves significant performance improvements over baseline models such as PointPillar, CenterPoint-Pillar, and PillarNet, with only a minor increase in computational overhead.</p></details> | ICRA 2024 |
| **[A Unified Model for Spatio-Temporal Prediction Queries with Arbitrary Modifiable Areal Units](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07022v1)** | 2024-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-Temporal (ST) prediction is crucial for making informed decisions in urban location-based applications like ride-sharing. However, existing ST models often require region partition as a prerequisite, resulting in two main pitfalls. Firstly, location-based services necessitate ad-hoc regions for various purposes, requiring multiple ST models with varying scales and zones, which can be costly to support. Secondly, different ST models may produce conflicting outputs, resulting in confusing predictions. In this paper, we propose One4All-ST, a framework that can conduct ST prediction for arbitrary modifiable areal units using only one model. To reduce the cost of getting multi-scale predictions, we design an ST network with hierarchical spatial modeling and scale normalization modules to efficiently and equally learn multi-scale representations. To address prediction inconsistencies across scales, we propose a dynamic programming scheme to solve the formulated optimal combination problem, minimizing predicted error through theoretical analysis. Besides, we suggest using an extended quad-tree to index the optimal combinations for quick response to arbitrary modifiable areal units in practical online scenarios. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the efficiency and effectiveness of One4All-ST in ST prediction for arbitrary modifiable areal units.

Despite their success, they fail to model intrinsic uncertainties within STG data, which cripples their practicality in downstream tasks for decision-making. To this end, this paper focuses on probabilistic STG forecasting, which is challenging due to the difficulty in modeling uncertainties and complex ST dependencies. In this study, we present the first attempt to generalize the popular denoising diffusion probabilistic models to STGs, leading to a novel non-autoregressive framework called DiffSTG, along with the first denoising network UGnet for STG in the framework. Our approach combines the spatio-temporal learning capabilities of STGNNs with the uncertainty measurements of diffusion models. Extensive experiments validate that DiffSTG reduces the Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS) by 4%-14%, and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) by 2%-7% over existing methods on three real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 31st ACM SIGSPATIAL International Conference on Advances in Geographic Information Systems</p></details> |
| **[Extraction and Recovery of Spatio-Temporal Structure in Latent Dynamics Alignment with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06138v2)** | 2024-03-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of behavior-related brain computation, it is necessary to align raw neural signals against the drastic domain shift among them. A foundational framework within neuroscience research posits that trial-based neural population activities rely on low-dimensional latent dynamics, thus focusing on the latter greatly facilitates the alignment procedure. Despite this field's progress, existing methods ignore the intrinsic spatio-temporal structure during the alignment phase. Hence, their solutions usually lead to poor quality in latent dynamics structures and overall performance. To tackle this problem, we propose an alignment method ERDiff, which leverages the expressivity of the diffusion model to preserve the spatio-temporal structure of latent dynamics. Specifically, the latent dynamics structures of the source domain are first extracted by a diffusion model. Then, under the guidance of this diffusion model, such structures are well-recovered through a maximum likelihood alignment procedure in the target domain. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method on a synthetic dataset. Then, when applied to neural recordings from the non-human primate motor cortex, under both cross-day and inter-subject settings, our method consistently manifests its capability of preserving the spatiotemporal structure of latent dynamics and outperforms existing approaches in alignment goodness-of-fit and neural decoding performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-Factor Spatio-Temporal Prediction based on Graph Decomposition Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10374v2)** | 2024-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction is an important and widely used technique in data mining and analytics, especially for ST data in urban systems such as transportation data. In practice, the ST data generation is usually influenced by various latent factors tied to natural phenomena or human socioeconomic activities, impacting specific spatial areas selectively. However, existing ST prediction methods usually do not refine the impacts of different factors, but directly model the entangled impacts of multiple factors. This amplifies the modeling complexity of ST data and compromises model interpretability. To this end, we propose a multi-factor ST prediction task that predicts partial ST data evolution under different factors, and combines them for a final prediction. We make two contributions to this task: an effective theoretical solution and a portable instantiation framework. Specifically, we first propose a theoretical solution called decomposed prediction strategy and prove its effectiveness from the perspective of information entropy theory. On top of that, we instantiate a novel model-agnostic framework, named spatio-temporal graph decomposition learning (STGDL), for multi-factor ST prediction. The framework consists of two main components: an automatic graph decomposition module that decomposes the original graph structure inherent in ST data into subgraphs corresponding to different factors, and a decomposed learning network that learns the partial ST data on each subgraph separately and integrates them for the final prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on four real-world ST datasets of two types of graphs, i.e., grid graph and network graph. Results show that our framework significantly reduces prediction errors of various ST models by 9.41% on average (35.36% at most). Furthermore, a case study reveals the interpretability potential of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Deconfounding Against Spatio-Temporal Shifts: Theory and Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12472v2)** | 2024-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important application of spatio-temporal (ST) data, ST traffic forecasting plays a crucial role in improving urban travel efficiency and promoting sustainable development. In practice, the dynamics of traffic data frequently undergo distributional shifts attributed to external factors such as time evolution and spatial differences. This entails forecasting models to handle the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue where test data is distributed differently from training data. In this work, we first formalize the problem by constructing a causal graph of past traffic data, future traffic data, and external ST contexts. We reveal that the failure of prior arts in OOD traffic data is due to ST contexts acting as a confounder, i.e., the common cause for past data and future ones. Then, we propose a theoretical solution named Disentangled Contextual Adjustment (DCA) from a causal lens. It differentiates invariant causal correlations against variant spurious ones and deconfounds the effect of ST contexts. On top of that, we devise a Spatio-Temporal sElf-superVised dEconfounding (STEVE) framework. It first encodes traffic data into two disentangled representations for associating invariant and variant ST contexts. Then, we use representative ST contexts from three conceptually different perspectives (i.e., temporal, spatial, and semantic) as self-supervised signals to inject context information into both representations. In this way, we improve the generalization ability of the learned context-oriented representations to OOD ST traffic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on four large-scale benchmark datasets demonstrate that our STEVE consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines across various ST OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |

A recent approach, GParareal, combines Gaussian Processes with traditional PinT methodology (Parareal) to achieve faster parallel speed-ups. The method is known to outperform Parareal for low-dimensional ODEs and a limited number of computer cores. Here, we present Nearest Neighbors GParareal (nnGParareal), a novel data-enriched PinT integration algorithm. nnGParareal builds upon GParareal by improving its scalability properties for higher-dimensional systems and increased processor count. Through data reduction, the model complexity is reduced from cubic to log-linear in the sample size, yielding a fast and automated procedure to integrate initial value problems over long time intervals. First, we provide both an upper bound for the error and theoretical details on the speed-up benefits. Then, we empirically illustrate the superior performance of nnGParareal, compared to GParareal and Parareal, on nine different systems with unique features (e.g., stiff, chaotic, high-dimensional, or challenging-to-learn systems).</p></details> |  |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Connected Components in Linear Work and Near-Optimal Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02332v3)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing the connected components of a graph is a fundamental problem in algorithmic graph theory. A major question in this area is whether we can compute connected components in $o(\log n)$ parallel time. Recent works showed an affirmative answer in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model for a wide class of graphs. Specifically, Behnezhad et al. (FOCS'19) showed that connected components can be computed in $O(\log d + \log \log n)$ rounds in the MPC model. More recently, Liu et al. (SPAA'20) showed that the same result can be achieved in the standard PRAM model but their result incurs $\Theta((m+n) \cdot (\log d + \log \log n))$ work which is sub-optimal. In this paper, we show that for graphs that contain \emph{well-connected} components, we can compute connected components on a PRAM in sub-logarithmic parallel time with \emph{optimal}, i.e., $O(m+n)$ total work. Specifically, our algorithm achieves $O(\log(1/\lambda) + \log \log n)$ parallel time with high probability, where $\lambda$ is the minimum spectral gap of any connected component in the input graph. The algorithm requires no prior knowledge on $\lambda$. Additionally, based on the \textsc{2-Cycle} Conjecture we provide a time lower bound of $\Omega(\log(1/\lambda))$ for solving connected components on a PRAM with $O(m+n)$ total memory when $\lambda \le (1/\log n)^c$, giving conditional optimality to the running time of our algorithm as a parameter of $\lambda$.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Active Learning Framework with a Class Balancing Strategy for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12122v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training machine learning models for classification tasks often requires labeling numerous samples, which is costly and time-consuming, especially in time series analysis. This research investigates Active Learning (AL) strategies to reduce the amount of labeled data needed for effective time series classification. Traditional AL techniques cannot control the selection of instances per class for labeling, leading to potential bias in classification performance and instance selection, particularly in imbalanced time series datasets. To address this, we propose a novel class-balancing instance selection algorithm integrated with standard AL strategies. Our approach aims to select more instances from classes with fewer labeled examples, thereby addressing imbalance in time series datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our AL framework in selecting informative data samples for two distinct domains of tactile texture recognition and industrial fault detection. In robotics, our method achieves high-performance texture categorization while significantly reducing labeled training data requirements to 70%. We also evaluate the impact of different sliding window time intervals on robotic texture classification using AL strategies. In synthetic fiber manufacturing, we adapt AL techniques to address the challenge of fault classification, aiming to minimize data annotation cost and time for industries. We also address real-life class imbalances in the multiclass industrial anomalous dataset using our class-balancing instance algorithm integrated with AL strategies. Overall, this thesis highlights the potential of our AL framework across these two distinct domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's thesis accepted by Memorial University of Newfoundland.

The system is built on top of the Robot Operating System (ROS) and combines the real-time performance of traditional methods with the high accuracy of deep learning approaches. The system leverages edge computing capabilities of roadside units (RSUs) for precise localization to enhance on-vehicle localization that is based on the real-time visual odometry. EdgeLoc is a parallel processing system, utilizing a proposed uncertainty-aware pose fusion solution. It achieves communication adaptivity through online learning and addresses fluctuations via window-based detection. Moreover, it achieves optimal latency and maximum improvement by utilizing auto-splitting vehicle-infrastructure collaborative inference, as well as online distribution learning for decision-making. Even with the most basic end-to-end deep neural network for localization estimation, EdgeLoc realizes a 67.75\% reduction in the localization error for real-time local visual odometry, a 29.95\% reduction for non-real-time collaborative inference, and a 30.26\% reduction compared to Kalman filtering. Finally, accuracy-to-latency conversion was experimentally validated, and an overall experiment was conducted on a practical cellular network. The system is open sourced at https://github.com/LoganCome/EdgeAssistedLocalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciding branching hyperproperties for real time systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12104v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security properties of real-time systems often involve reasoning about hyper-properties, as opposed to properties of single executions or trees of executions. These hyper-properties need to additionally be expressive enough to reason about real-time constraints. Examples of such properties include information flow, side channel attacks and service-level agreements. In this paper we study computational problems related to a branching-time, hyper-property extension of metric temporal logic (MTL) that we call HCMTL*. We consider both the interval-based and point-based semantics of this logic. The verification problem that we consider is to determine if a given HCMTL* formula $\varphi$ is true in a system represented by a timed automaton. We show that this problem is undecidable. We then show that the verification problem is decidable if we consider executions upto a fixed time horizon $T$. Our decidability result relies on reducing the verification problem to the truth of an MSO formula over reals with a bounded time interval.</p></details> |  |
| **[PATE: Proximity-Aware Time series anomaly Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12096v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating anomaly detection algorithms in time series data is critical as inaccuracies can lead to flawed decision-making in various domains where real-time analytics and data-driven strategies are essential. Traditional performance metrics assume iid data and fail to capture the complex temporal dynamics and specific characteristics of time series anomalies, such as early and delayed detections. We introduce Proximity-Aware Time series anomaly Evaluation (PATE), a novel evaluation metric that incorporates the temporal relationship between prediction and anomaly intervals. PATE uses proximity-based weighting considering buffer zones around anomaly intervals, enabling a more detailed and informed assessment of a detection. Using these weights, PATE computes a weighted version of the area under the Precision and Recall curve. Our experiments with synthetic and real-world datasets show the superiority of PATE in providing more sensible and accurate evaluations than other evaluation metrics. We also tested several state-of-the-art anomaly detectors across various benchmark datasets using the PATE evaluation scheme. The results show that a common metric like Point-Adjusted F1 Score fails to characterize the detection performances well, and that PATE is able to provide a more fair model comparison. By introducing PATE, we redefine the understanding of model efficacy that steers future studies toward developing more effective and accurate detection models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining (KDD 2024), Research Track.

| **[Adaptive Extraction Network for Multivariate Long Sequence Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12038v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models employing CNN architecture have made significant progress in multivariate long sequence time-series forecasting (MLSTF), particularly in modeling local time series characteristics. However, during the MLSTF process, extracting the global time series patterns and understanding the correlations among different variables are highly significant. To address this challenge, we introduce multi-resolution convolution and deformable convolution operations. By enlarging the receptive field using convolution kernels with different dilation factors to capture temporal correlation information across different resolutions, and adaptively adjusting the sampling positions through additional offset vectors, we enhance the network's ability to capture correlated features between variables. Building upon this, we propose ATVCNet, an adaptive temporal-variable convolutional network designed to effectively model the local/global temporal dependencies and inter-variable dependencies of multivariate time series. Specifically, extracting and fusing time series features at different resolutions, captures both local contextual information and global patterns in the time series. The designed inter-variable feature adaptive extraction module captures the correlation among different variables in the time series. We evaluated the performance of ATVCNet across eight real-world datasets. The results indicate that ATVCNet achieved a performance improvement of approximately 63.4% over state-of-the-art MLSTF models.</p></details> |  |

While prior studies have largely employed reconstruction-based approaches, which limits the models' representational capacities.

We then introduce the Stability Modulated Dynamic Time Warping algorithm for incorporating the stability regions, i.e. the most similar parts between two signatures, into the distance measure between a pair of signatures computed by the Dynamic Time Warping for signature verification. Experiments were conducted on two datasets largely adopted for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm improves the performance of the baseline system and compares favourably with other top performing signature verification systems.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that global tests do not perform well in this case, as they were not designed to capture very short-lived instabilities, and their power vanishes altogether when the magnitude of the shock is very large. We then discuss and propose approaches that are more suitable to detect such situations, such as nonparametric methods (S test or MAX procedure). We illustrate these results in different Monte Carlo exercises and in evaluating the nowcast of the quarterly US nominal GDP from the Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) against a naive benchmark of no growth, over the period that includes the GDP instability brought by the Covid-19 crisis. We recommend that the forecaster should not pool the sample, but exclude the short periods of high local instability from the evaluation exercise.</p></details> |  |

Continuous time models enable us to properly provide scale-based time series models for irregularly-spaced observations for the first time, while also permitting a spectral representation of the process over a continuous range of scales. We derive results for both the theoretical setting, where we assume access to the entire process sample path, and a more practical one, which develops methods for estimating the quantities of interest from sampled time series. The latter estimates are accurately computable in reasonable time by solving the relevant linear integral equation using the iterative thresholding method due to Daubechies, Defrise and De Mol. Appropriate smoothing techniques are also developed and applied in this new setting. We exemplify our new methods by computing spectral and autocovariance estimates on irregularly-spaced heart rate data obtained from a recent sleep-state study.</p></details> | 38 pages, 12 figures |

A numerical solution for the response time distribution in two parallel PS queues with JSQ scheduling is derived for the first time. Using the generating function method, two partial differential equations (PDEs) are obtained corresponding to conditional response times, where the conditioning is on a particular traced task joining the first or the second queue. These PDEs are functional equations that contain partial generating functions and their partial derivatives, and therefore cannot be solved by commonly used techniques. We are able to solve these PDEs numerically with good accuracy and perform the deconditioning with respect to the queue-length probabilities by evaluating a certain complex integral. Numerical results for the density and the first four moments compare well against regenerative simulation with 500,000 regeneration cycles.</p></details> |  |

The algorithm is within the querying framework of Angluin's $L^*$ algorithm and follows the idea proposed in existing work on the active learning of deterministic one-clock timed automata. We introduce an equivalence relation over the reset-clocked language of a timed automaton and then transform the learning problem into learning the corresponding reset-clocked language of the target automaton. Since a reset-clocked language includes the clock reset information which is not observable, we first present the approach of learning from a powerful teacher who can provide reset information by answering reset information queries from the learner. Then we extend the algorithm in a normal teacher situation in which the learner can only ask standard membership query and equivalence query while the learner guesses the reset information. We prove that the learning algorithm terminates and returns a correct deterministic timed automaton. Due to the need of guessing whether the clocks reset at the transitions, the algorithm is of exponential complexity in the size of the target automaton.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages.

However, the mass heterogeneous resources composition and lack of scheduling strategies make the modeling and cooperating of multi-edge computing system particularly complicated. This paper first proposes a system-level state evaluation model to shield the complex hardware configurations and redefine the different service capabilities at heterogeneous edges. Secondly, an integer linear programming model is designed to cater for optimally dispatching the distributed arriving requests. Finally, a learning-based lightweight real-time scheduler, CoRaiS, is proposed. CoRaiS embeds the real-time states of multi-edge system and requests information, and combines the embeddings with a policy network to schedule the requests, so that the response time of all requests can be minimized. Evaluation results verify that CoRaiS can make a high-quality scheduling decision in real time, and can be generalized to other multi-edge computing system, regardless of system scales. Characteristic validation also demonstrates that CoRaiS successfully learns to balance loads, perceive real-time state and recognize heterogeneity while scheduling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |
| **[Boosting MLPs with a Coarsening Strategy for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03199v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning methods have been exerting their strengths in long-term time series forecasting. However, they often struggle to strike a balance between expressive power and computational efficiency. Resorting to multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) provides a compromising solution, yet they suffer from two critical problems caused by the intrinsic point-wise mapping mode, in terms of deficient contextual dependencies and inadequate information bottleneck. Here, we propose the Coarsened Perceptron Network (CP-Net), featured by a coarsening strategy that alleviates the above problems associated with the prototype MLPs by forming information granules in place of solitary temporal points. The CP-Net utilizes primarily a two-stage framework for extracting semantic and contextual patterns, which preserves correlations over larger timespans and filters out volatile noises. This is further enhanced by a multi-scale setting, where patterns of diverse granularities are fused towards a comprehensive prediction. Based purely on convolutions of structural simplicity, CP-Net is able to maintain a linear computational complexity and low runtime, while demonstrates an improvement of 4.1% compared with the SOTA method on seven forecasting benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[E2USD: Efficient-yet-effective Unsupervised State Detection for Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14041v5)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical system sensors emit multivariate time series (MTS) that monitor physical system processes. Such time series generally capture unknown numbers of states, each with a different duration, that correspond to specific conditions, e.g., "walking" or "running" in human-activity monitoring. Unsupervised identification of such states facilitates storage and processing in subsequent data analyses, as well as enhances result interpretability. Existing state-detection proposals face three challenges. First, they introduce substantial computational overhead, rendering them impractical in resourceconstrained or streaming settings. Second, although state-of-the-art (SOTA) proposals employ contrastive learning for representation, insufficient attention to false negatives hampers model convergence and accuracy. Third, SOTA proposals predominantly only emphasize offline non-streaming deployment, we highlight an urgent need to optimize online streaming scenarios. We propose E2Usd that enables efficient-yet-accurate unsupervised MTS state detection. E2Usd exploits a Fast Fourier Transform-based Time Series Compressor (fftCompress) and a Decomposed Dual-view Embedding Module (ddEM) that together encode input MTSs at low computational overhead. Additionally, we propose a False Negative Cancellation Contrastive Learning method (fnccLearning) to counteract the effects of false negatives and to achieve more cluster-friendly embedding spaces. To reduce computational overhead further in streaming settings, we introduce Adaptive Threshold Detection (adaTD). Comprehensive experiments with six baselines and six datasets offer evidence that E2Usd is capable of SOTA accuracy at significantly reduced computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW 2024)</p></details> |

These methods attempt to improve accuracy by introducing new modules or integrating traditional methods. However, the improvements are only modest. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy by incorporating knowledge distillation and model pruning to overcome the inherent trade-off between speed and accuracy. As a result, we obtained a model that maintains real-time performance while delivering high accuracy on edge devices. Our proposed method involves three key steps. Firstly, we review state-of-the-art methods and design our lightweight model by removing redundant modules from those efficient models through a comparison of their contributions. Next, we leverage the efficient model as the teacher to distill knowledge into the lightweight model. Finally, we systematically prune the lightweight model to obtain the final model. Through extensive experiments conducted on two widely-used benchmarks, Sceneflow and KITTI, we perform ablation studies to analyze the effectiveness of each module and present our state-of-the-art results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inter...</summary><p>International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024</p></details> |
| **[Learnability with Time-Sharing Computational Resource Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02217v4)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional theoretical machine learning studies generally assume explicitly or implicitly that there are enough or even infinitely supplied computational resources. In real practice, however, computational resources are usually limited, and the performance of machine learning depends not only on how many data have been received, but also on how many data can be handled subject to computational resources available. Note that most current ``intelligent supercomputing'' facilities work like exclusive operating systems, where a fixed amount of resources are allocated to a machine learning task without adaptive scheduling strategies considering important factors such as the learning performance demands and learning process status. In this article, we introduce the notion of machine learning throughput, define Computational Resource Efficient Learning (CoRE-Learning), and present a theoretical framework that takes into account the influence of computational resources in learning theory. This framework can be naturally applied to stream learning where the incoming data streams can be potentially endless with overwhelming size and it is impractical to assume that all received data can be handled in time. It may also provide a theoretical perspective for the design of intelligent supercomputing operating systems.</p></details> |  |

In this study, a time-series generative model was applied as a quantum generative model to actual financial data. Future data for two correlated time series were generated and compared with classical methods such as long short-term memory and vector autoregression. Furthermore, numerical experiments were performed to complete missing values. Based on the results, we evaluated the practical applications of the time-series quantum generation model. It was observed that fewer parameter values were required compared with the classical method. In addition, the quantum time-series generation model was feasible for both stationary and nonstationary data. These results suggest that several parameters can be applied to various types of time-series data.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Touch is an active sense in which tactile measurements depend on the contact properties of an interaction--e.g., velocity, force, acceleration--as well as properties of the sensor and object under test. These dependencies make training tactile perceptual models challenging. Additionally, the effects of limited sensor life and the near-field nature of tactile sensors preclude the practical collection of exhaustive data sets even for fairly simple objects. Active learning provides a mechanism for focusing on only the most informative aspects of an object during data collection. Here we employ an active learning approach that uses a data-driven model's entropy as an uncertainty measure and explore relative to that entropy conditioned on the sensor state variables. Using a coverage-based ergodic controller, we train perceptual models in near-real time. We demonstrate our approach using a biomimentic sensor, exploring "tactile scenes" composed of shapes, textures, and objects. Each learned representation provides a perceptual sensor model for a particular tactile scene. Models trained on actively collected data outperform their randomly collected counterparts in real-time training tests. Additionally, we find that the resulting network entropy maps can be used to identify high salience portions of a tactile scene.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICRA 2024, 7 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Bounding Stochastic Safety: Leveraging Freedman's Inequality with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05745v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical robust safety methods achieve their guarantees by always assuming that the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) and c-martingales to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive safety constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as input-to-state safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is stronger. Finally, we present simulation examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

This work presents a centralized network control algorithm executable on already existing quantum computer which are based on the principle of quantum annealing like the D-Wave Advantage. We introduce a resource reoccupation algorithm for traffic engineering in wide-area networks. The proposed optimization algorithm changes traffic steering and resource allocation in case of overloaded transceivers. Settings of active components like fiber amplifiers and transceivers are not changed for the reason of stability. This algorithm is beneficial in situations when the network traffic is fluctuating in time scales of seconds or spontaneous bursts occur. Further, we developed a discrete-time flow simulator to study the algorithm's performance in wide-area networks. Our network simulator considers backlog and loss modeling of buffered transmission lines. Concurring flows are handled equally in case of a backlog. This work provides an ILP-based network configuring algorithm that is applicable on quantum annealing computers. We showcase, that traffic losses can be reduced significantly by a factor of 2 if a resource reoccupation algorithm is applied in a network with bursty traffic. As resources are used more efficiently by reoccupation in heavy load situations, overprovisioning of networks can be reduced. Thus, this new form of network operation leads toward a zero-margin network. We show that our newly introduced network simulator enables analyses of short-time effects like buffering within fat-pipe networks. As the calculation of network configurations in real-sized networks is typically time-consuming, quantum computing can enable the proposed network configuration algorithm for application in real-sized wide-area networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication at "IEEE International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing 2024"</p></details> |

Modern technologies such as Computer Vision and Deep Learning are highly beneficial, enabling machines to learn automatically, thereby facilitating automatic visual recognition. Despite some research in this field, the challenge of achieving accurate automatic food recognition quickly remains a significant research gap. Some models have been developed and implemented, but maintaining high performance swiftly, with low computational cost and low access to expensive hardware accelerators, still needs further exploration and research. This study employs the pretrained MobileNetV2 model, which is efficient and fast, for food recognition on the public Food11 dataset, comprising 16643 images. It also utilizes various techniques such as dataset understanding, transfer learning, data augmentation, regularization, dynamic learning rate, hyperparameter tuning, and consideration of images in different sizes to enhance performance and robustness. These techniques aid in choosing appropriate metrics, achieving better performance, avoiding overfitting and accuracy fluctuations, speeding up the model, and increasing the generalization of findings, making the study and its results applicable to practical applications. Despite employing a light model with a simpler structure and fewer trainable parameters compared to some deep and dense models in the deep learning area, it achieved commendable accuracy in a short time. This underscores the potential for practical implementation, which is the main intention of this study.</p></details> |  |

We propose a nonparametric data segmentation methodology for multivariate time series termed NP-MOJO. By considering joint characteristic functions between the time series and its lagged values, NP-MOJO is able to detect change points in the marginal distribution, but also those in possibly non-linear serial dependence, all without the need to pre-specify the type of changes. We show the theoretical consistency of NP-MOJO in estimating the total number and the locations of the change points, and demonstrate the good performance of NP-MOJO against a variety of change point scenarios. We further demonstrate its usefulness in applications to seismology and economic time series.</p></details> |  |

However, current studies still rely on the vanilla point-wise self-attention mechanism to capture cross-variable dependencies, which is inadequate in extracting the intricate cross-correlation implied between variables. To fill this gap, we propose Variable Correlation Transformer (VCformer), which utilizes Variable Correlation Attention (VCA) module to mine the correlations among variables. Specifically, based on the stochastic process theory, VCA calculates and integrates the cross-correlation scores corresponding to different lags between queries and keys, thereby enhancing its ability to uncover multivariate relationships. Additionally, inspired by Koopman dynamics theory, we also develop Koopman Temporal Detector (KTD) to better address the non-stationarity in time series. The two key components enable VCformer to extract both multivariate correlations and temporal dependencies. Our extensive experiments on eight real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VCformer, achieving top-tier performance compared to other state-of-the-art baseline models.

Such agents are typically required to execute user instructions in an online manner, leading us to explore the use of unlabeled test samples for effective online model adaptation. However, for online Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN), due to the intrinsic nature of inter-sample online instruction execution and intra-sample multi-step action decision, frequent updates can result in drastic changes in model parameters, while occasional updates can make the model ill-equipped to handle dynamically changing environments. Therefore, we propose a Fast-Slow Test-Time Adaptation (FSTTA) approach for online VLN by performing joint decomposition-accumulation analysis for both gradients and parameters in a unified framework. Extensive experiments show that our method obtains impressive performance gains on four popular benchmarks.

However, development in the area of open-domain and non-fine-tuning personalized image generation is proceeding rather slowly. In this paper, we propose Subject-Diffusion, a novel open-domain personalized image generation model that, in addition to not requiring test-time fine-tuning, also only requires a single reference image to support personalized generation of single- or multi-subject in any domain. Firstly, we construct an automatic data labeling tool and use the LAION-Aesthetics dataset to construct a large-scale dataset consisting of 76M images and their corresponding subject detection bounding boxes, segmentation masks and text descriptions. Secondly, we design a new unified framework that combines text and image semantics by incorporating coarse location and fine-grained reference image control to maximize subject fidelity and generalization. Furthermore, we also adopt an attention control mechanism to support multi-subject generation. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that our method outperforms other SOTA frameworks in single, multiple, and human customized image generation.

Although extracting features with both contextual and semantic information is critical for the segmentation tasks, it brings a memory footprint and high computation cost for real-time applications. This paper presents a new model to achieve a trade-off between accuracy/speed for real-time road scene semantic segmentation. Specifically, we proposed a lightweight model named Scale-aware Strip Attention Guided Feature Pyramid Network (S$^2$-FPN). Our network consists of three main modules: Attention Pyramid Fusion (APF) module, Scale-aware Strip Attention Module (SSAM), and Global Feature Upsample (GFU) module. APF adopts an attention mechanisms to learn discriminative multi-scale features and help close the semantic gap between different levels. APF uses the scale-aware attention to encode global context with vertical stripping operation and models the long-range dependencies, which helps relate pixels with similar semantic label. In addition, APF employs channel-wise reweighting block (CRB) to emphasize the channel features. Finally, the decoder of S$^2$-FPN then adopts GFU, which is used to fuse features from APF and the encoder. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two challenging semantic segmentation benchmarks, which demonstrate that our approach achieves better accuracy/speed trade-off with different model settings. The proposed models have achieved a results of 76.2\%mIoU/87.3FPS, 77.4\%mIoU/67FPS, and 77.8\%mIoU/30.5FPS on Cityscapes dataset, and 69.6\%mIoU,71.0\% mIoU, and 74.2\% mIoU on Camvid dataset.

A compact way to represent scenes while encoding geometric distances and semantic object information is via 3D semantic occupancy maps. State of the art 3D mapping methods leverage transformers with cross-attention mechanisms to elevate 2D vision-centric camera features into the 3D domain. However, these methods encounter significant challenges in real-time applications due to their high computational demands during inference. This limitation is particularly problematic in autonomous vehicles, where GPU resources must be shared with other tasks such as localization and planning. In this paper, we introduce an approach that extracts features from front-view 2D camera images and LiDAR scans, then employs a sparse convolution network (Minkowski Engine), for 3D semantic occupancy prediction. Given that outdoor scenes in autonomous driving scenarios are inherently sparse, the utilization of sparse convolution is particularly apt. By jointly solving the problems of 3D scene completion of sparse scenes and 3D semantic segmentation, we provide a more efficient learning framework suitable for real-time applications in autonomous vehicles. We also demonstrate competitive accuracy on the nuScenes dataset.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Diffusion generative models, as an emerging research focus, have been applied to graph generation tasks. Overall, according to the space of states and time steps, diffusion generative models can be categorized into discrete-/continuous-state discrete-/continuous-time fashions. In this paper, we formulate the graph diffusion generation in a discrete-state continuous-time setting, which has never been studied in previous graph diffusion models. The rationale of such a formulation is to preserve the discrete nature of graph-structured data and meanwhile provide flexible sampling trade-offs between sample quality and efficiency. Analysis shows that our training objective is closely related to generation quality, and our proposed generation framework enjoys ideal invariant/equivariant properties concerning the permutation of node ordering. Our proposed model shows competitive empirical performance against state-of-the-art graph generation solutions on various benchmarks and, at the same time, can flexibly trade off the generation quality and efficiency in the sampling phase.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |

The spatially semidiscrete scheme covers several popular lowest-order piecewise-quadratic finite element schemes, namely, Morley, discontinuous Galerkin, and $C^0$ interior penalty methods, and includes both smooth and nonsmooth initial data. Optimal order error bounds with respect to the regularity assumptions on the data are proved for both homogeneous and nonhomogeneous problems.

| **[GinAR: An End-To-End Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Model Suitable for Variable Missing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11333v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) is crucial for decision-making to precisely forecast the future values/trends, based on the complex relationships identified from historical observations of multiple sequences. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Networks (STGNNs) have gradually become the theme of MTSF model as their powerful capability in mining spatial-temporal dependencies, but almost of them heavily rely on the assumption of historical data integrity. In reality, due to factors such as data collector failures and time-consuming repairment, it is extremely challenging to collect the whole historical observations without missing any variable. In this case, STGNNs can only utilize a subset of normal variables and easily suffer from the incorrect spatial-temporal dependency modeling issue, resulting in the degradation of their forecasting performance. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Graph Interpolation Attention Recursive Network (named GinAR) to precisely model the spatial-temporal dependencies over the limited collected data for forecasting. In GinAR, it consists of two key components, that is, interpolation attention and adaptive graph convolution to take place of the fully connected layer of simple recursive units, and thus are capable of recovering all missing variables and reconstructing the correct spatial-temporal dependencies for recursively modeling of multivariate time series data, respectively. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world datasets demonstrate that GinAR outperforms 11 SOTA baselines, and even when 90% of variables are missing, it can still accurately predict the future values of all variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2024 (Research track)</p></details> |

However, their performance can easily degrade on test domains due to distribution shifts caused by input-level corruptions, such as imaging equipment variability, brightness changes, and image blur. This will reduce the reliability of model deployment in real-world scenarios. Most existing solutions focus on adapting the source model through retraining on different target domains. Although effective, this retraining process is sensitive to the amount of data and the hyperparameter configuration for optimization. In this paper, we propose a test-time image adaptation method to enhance the accuracy of the model on test data by simultaneously updating and predicting test images. We modify the target test images by projecting them back to the source domain using a diffusion model. Specifically, we design a structure guidance module that adds refinement operations through low-pass filtering during reverse sampling, regularizing the diffusion to preserve structural information. Additionally, we introduce a self-ensembling scheme automatically adjusts the reliance on adapted and unadapted inputs, enhancing adaptation robustness by rejecting inappropriate generative modeling results. To facilitate this study, we constructed the ISIC2019-C and Dermnet-C corruption robustness evaluation benchmarks. Extensive experiments on the proposed benchmarks demonstrate that our method makes the classifier more robust across various corruptions, architectures, and data regimes.

Fairness in LTR models is crucial to allocate exposure proportionally to item relevance. Widely used deterministic LTR models can lead to unfair exposure distribution, especially when items with the same relevance receive slightly different ranking scores. Stochastic LTR models, incorporating the Plackett-Luce (PL) ranking model, address fairness issues but suffer from high training cost. In addition, they cannot provide guarantees on the utility or fairness, which can lead to dramatic degraded utility when optimized for fairness. To overcome these limitations, we propose Inference-time Stochastic Ranking with Risk Control (ISRR), a novel method that performs stochastic ranking at inference time with guanranteed utility or fairness given pretrained scoring functions from deterministic or stochastic LTR models. Comprehensive experimental results on three widely adopted datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves utility and fairness comparable to existing stochastic ranking methods with much lower computational cost. In addition, results verify that our method provides finite-sample guarantee on utility and fairness. This advancement represents a significant contribution to the field of stochastic ranking and fair LTR with promising real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Lag Selection for Univariate Time Series Forecasting using Deep Learning: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11237v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most forecasting methods use recent past observations (lags) to model the future values of univariate time series. Selecting an adequate number of lags is important for training accurate forecasting models. Several approaches and heuristics have been devised to solve this task. However, there is no consensus about what the best approach is. Besides, lag selection procedures have been developed based on local models and classical forecasting techniques such as ARIMA. We bridge this gap in the literature by carrying out an extensive empirical analysis of different lag selection methods. We focus on deep learning methods trained in a global approach, i.e., on datasets comprising multiple univariate time series. The experiments were carried out using three benchmark databases that contain a total of 2411 univariate time series. The results indicate that the lag size is a relevant parameter for accurate forecasts. In particular, excessively small or excessively large lag sizes have a considerable negative impact on forecasting performance. Cross-validation approaches show the best performance for lag selection, but this performance is comparable with simple heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real Time Monitoring and Forecasting of COVID 19 Cases using an Adjusted Holt based Hybrid Model embedded with Wavelet based ANN](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11213v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the inception of the SARS - CoV - 2 (COVID - 19) novel coronavirus, a lot of time and effort is being allocated to estimate the trajectory and possibly, forecast with a reasonable degree of accuracy, the number of cases, recoveries, and deaths due to the same. The model proposed in this paper is a mindful step in the same direction. The primary model in question is a Hybrid Holt's Model embedded with a Wavelet-based ANN. To test its forecasting ability, we have compared three separate models, the first, being a simple ARIMA model, the second, also an ARIMA model with a wavelet-based function, and the third, being the proposed model. We have also compared the forecast accuracy of this model with that of a modern day Vanilla LSTM recurrent neural network model. We have tested the proposed model on the number of confirmed cases (daily) for the entire country as well as 6 hotspot states. We have also proposed a simple adjustment algorithm in addition to the hybrid model so that daily and/or weekly forecasts can be meted out, with respect to the entirety of the country, as well as a moving window performance metric based on out-of-sample forecasts. In order to have a more rounded approach to the analysis of COVID-19 dynamics, focus has also been given to the estimation of the Basic Reproduction Number, $R_0$ using a compartmental epidemiological model (SIR). Lastly, we have also given substantial attention to estimating the shelf-life of the proposed model. It is obvious yet noteworthy how an accurate model, in this regard, can ensure better allocation of healthcare resources, as well as, enable the government to take necessary measures ahead of time.</p></details> | 36 pages, 41 figures |

Initially, we investigate the initial value problem within Sobolev spaces, deriving conditions under which solutions are either global or experience blow-up in time. Subsequently, we extend our analysis to Bessel potential and modulation spaces, determining the asymptotic behavior of solutions. We establish the non-existence of solitary waves for certain parameters using Pohozaev-type identities. Additionally, we numerically generate solitary wave solutions of the generalized Boussinesq equation through the Petviashvili iteration method. To further examine the time evolution of solutions, we propose employing the Fourier pseudo-spectral numerical method. Our investigation extends to the gap interval, where neither global existence nor blow-up results have been theoretically established. We find that our numerical results effectively fill these gaps, supplementing the theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaWaveNet: Adaptive Wavelet Network for Time Series Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11124v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series data analysis is a critical component in various domains such as finance, healthcare, and meteorology. Despite the progress in deep learning for time series analysis, there remains a challenge in addressing the non-stationary nature of time series data. Traditional models, which are built on the assumption of constant statistical properties over time, often struggle to capture the temporal dynamics in realistic time series, resulting in bias and error in time series analysis. This paper introduces the Adaptive Wavelet Network (AdaWaveNet), a novel approach that employs Adaptive Wavelet Transformation for multi-scale analysis of non-stationary time series data. AdaWaveNet designed a lifting scheme-based wavelet decomposition and construction mechanism for adaptive and learnable wavelet transforms, which offers enhanced flexibility and robustness in analysis. We conduct extensive experiments on 10 datasets across 3 different tasks, including forecasting, imputation, and a newly established super-resolution task. The evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of AdaWaveNet over existing methods in all three tasks, which illustrates its potential in various real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We define the notion of a first-order changepoint for a time series of networks, and construct a family of latent position process networks with underlying first-order changepoints. We prove that a spectral estimate of the associated Euclidean mirror localizes these changepoints, even when the graph distribution evolves continuously, but at a rate that changes. Simulated and real data examples on organoid networks show that this localization captures empirically significant shifts in network evolution.</p></details> |  |

Various approaches have been introduced to time series analysis, including both statistical approaches and deep neural networks. Although neural network approaches have illustrated stronger ability of representation than statistical methods, they struggle to provide sufficient interpretablility, and can be too complicated to optimize. In this paper, we present WEITS, a frequency-aware deep learning framework that is highly interpretable and computationally efficient. Through multi-level wavelet decomposition, WEITS novelly infuses frequency analysis into a highly deep learning framework. Combined with a forward-backward residual architecture, it enjoys both high representation capability and statistical interpretability. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated competitive performance of our model, along with its additional advantage of high computation efficiency. Furthermore, WEITS provides a general framework that can always seamlessly integrate with state-of-the-art approaches for time series forecast.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2310.09488 by other authors</p></details> |

We focus on a time series of matrices defined on a static 2-D spatial grid and an auxiliary time series of non-spatial vectors. The proposed model, Matrix AutoRegression with Auxiliary Covariates (MARAC), contains an autoregressive component for the historical matrix predictors and an additive component that maps the auxiliary vector predictors to a matrix response via tensor-vector product. The autoregressive component adopts a bi-linear transformation framework following Chen et al. (2021), significantly reducing the number of parameters. The auxiliary component posits that the tensor coefficient, which maps non-spatial predictors to a spatial response, contains slices of spatially smooth matrix coefficients that are discrete evaluations of smooth functions from a Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We propose to estimate the model parameters under a penalized maximum likelihood estimation framework coupled with an alternating minimization algorithm. We establish the joint asymptotics of the autoregressive and tensor parameters under fixed and high-dimensional regimes. Extensive simulations and a geophysical application for forecasting the global Total Electron Content (TEC) are conducted to validate the performance of MARAC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning for Spatiotemporal Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10800v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal time series forecasting plays a key role in a wide range of real-world applications. While significant progress has been made in this area, fully capturing and leveraging spatiotemporal heterogeneity remains a fundamental challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Heterogeneity-Informed Meta-Parameter Learning scheme. Specifically, our approach implicitly captures spatiotemporal heterogeneity through learning spatial and temporal embeddings, which can be viewed as a clustering process. Then, a novel spatiotemporal meta-parameter learning paradigm is proposed to learn spatiotemporal-specific parameters from meta-parameter pools, which is informed by the captured heterogeneity. Based on these ideas, we develop a Heterogeneity-Informed Spatiotemporal Meta-Network (HimNet) for spatiotemporal time series forecasting. Extensive experiments on five widely-used benchmarks demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while exhibiting superior interpretability.

We analyze the execution time of the models as well as the resources consumed, such as memory and computational power. Our aim is to demonstrate that the specialized architecture not only achieves better results in forex market prediction but also executes using fewer resources and in a shorter time frame compared to LSTM architectures. This comparative analysis will provide significant insights into the suitability of these two types of architectures for time series prediction in the forex market environment.</p></details> |  |

Over the past few years, deep learning models especially Transformers have achieved advanced performance in LTSF tasks. However, LTSF faces inherent challenges such as long-term dependencies capturing and sparse semantic characteristics. Recently, a new state space model (SSM) named Mamba is proposed. With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba has shown great potential in balancing predicting performance and computational efficiency compared to Transformers. To enhance Mamba's ability to preserve historical information in a longer range, we design a novel Mamba+ block by adding a forget gate inside Mamba to selectively combine the new features with the historical features in a complementary manner. Furthermore, we apply Mamba+ both forward and backward and propose Bi-Mamba+, aiming to promote the model's ability to capture interactions among time series elements. Additionally, multivariate time series data in different scenarios may exhibit varying emphasis on intra- or inter-series dependencies. Therefore, we propose a series-relation-aware decider that controls the utilization of channel-independent or channel-mixing tokenization strategy for specific datasets. Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show that our model achieves more accurate predictions compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>New M...</summary><p>New Mamba-based architecture.

The search for the best segmentation can be expressed as a minimization problem over a given cost function. We focus on dynamic programming algorithms that solve this problem exactly. When the number of changes is proportional to data length, an inequality-based pruning rule encoded in the PELT algorithm leads to a linear time complexity. Another type of pruning, called functional pruning, gives a close-to-linear time complexity whatever the number of changes, but only for the analysis of univariate time series. We propose a few extensions of functional pruning for multiple independent time series based on the use of simple geometric shapes (balls and hyperrectangles). We focus on the Gaussian case, but some of our rules can be easily extended to the exponential family. In a simulation study we compare the computational efficiency of different geometric-based pruning rules. We show that for small dimensions (2, 3, 4) some of them ran significantly faster than inequality-based approaches in particular when the underlying number of changes is small compared to the data length.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 11 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, the complexity inherent in Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) creates a challenge when it comes to explainability methods. To overcome this inherent lack of interpretability, we propose ECATS, a concept-based neuro-symbolic architecture where concepts are represented as Signal Temporal Logic (STL) formulae. Leveraging kernel-based methods for STL, concept embeddings are learnt in an unsupervised manner through a cross-attention mechanism. The network makes class predictions through these concept embeddings, allowing for a meaningful explanation to be naturally extracted for each input. Our preliminary experiments with a simple CPS-based dataset show that our model is able to achieve great classification performance while ensuring local interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, submitted to 18th International Conference on Neural-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning (NeSy 2024)</p></details> |

To handle the inherent complexities of time-series data, such as high dimensionality and noise, traditional supervised learning methods first annotate extensive labels for time-series data in each task, which is very costly and impractical in real-world applications. In contrast, pre-trained foundation models offer a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data to capture general time series patterns, which can then be fine-tuned for specific tasks. However, existing approaches to pre-training such models typically suffer from high-bias and low-generality issues due to the use of predefined and rigid augmentation operations and domain-specific data training. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces UniCL, a universal and scalable contrastive learning framework designed for pretraining time-series foundation models across cross-domain datasets. Specifically, we propose a unified and trainable time-series augmentation operation to generate pattern-preserved, diverse, and low-bias time-series data by leveraging spectral information. Besides, we introduce a scalable augmentation algorithm capable of handling datasets with varying lengths, facilitating cross-domain pretraining. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets across eleven domains validate the effectiveness of UniCL, demonstrating its high generalization on time-series analysis across various fields.</p></details> |  |

Data-driven models offer a promising solution, but acquiring the requisite data remains expensive and is potentially unsafe. Safe active learning techniques prove essential, enabling the learning of high-quality models with minimal expensive data points and high safety. This paper introduces a safe active learning framework tailored for time-varying systems, addressing drift, seasonal changes, and complexities due to dynamic behavior. The proposed Time-aware Integrated Mean Squared Prediction Error (T-IMSPE) method minimizes posterior variance over current and future states, optimizing information gathering also in the time domain. Empirical results highlight T-IMSPE's advantages in model quality through toy and real-world examples. State of the art Gaussian processes are compatible with T-IMSPE. Our theoretical contributions include a clear delineation which Gaussian process kernels, domains, and weighting measures are suitable for T-IMSPE and even beyond for its non-time aware predecessor IMSPE.</p></details> |  |

However, the prevailing level-of-detail solution employing hair cards for distant hair models introduces a significant discontinuity in dynamics and appearance during the transition from strands to cards. We introduce an innovative real-time framework for strand-based hair rendering that ensures seamless transitions between different levels of detail (LOD) while maintaining a consistent hair appearance. Our method uses elliptical thick hairs that contain multiple hair strands at each LOD to maintain the shapes of hair clusters. In addition to geometric fitting, we formulate an elliptical Bidirectional Curve Scattering Distribution Functions (BCSDF) model for a thick hair, accurately capturing single scattering and multiple scattering within the hair cluster, accommodating a spectrum from sparse to dense hair distributions. Our framework, tested on various hairstyles with dynamics as well as knits, shows that it can produce highly similar appearances to full hair geometries at different viewing distances with seamless LOD transitions, while achieving up to a 3x speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 10 figures, 1 performance plot</p></details> |

To maximize the effectiveness of such energy storage, determining the appropriate charging and discharging amounts for each time period is crucial. Reinforcement learning is preferred over traditional optimization for the control of energy storage due to its ability to adapt to dynamic and complex environments. However, the continuous nature of charging and discharging levels in energy storage poses limitations for discrete reinforcement learning, and time-varying feasible charge-discharge range based on state of charge (SoC) variability also limits the conventional continuous reinforcement learning. In this paper, we propose a continuous reinforcement learning approach that takes into account the time-varying feasible charge-discharge range. An additional objective function was introduced for learning the feasible action range for each time period, supplementing the objectives of training the actor for policy learning and the critic for value learning. This actively promotes the utilization of energy storage by preventing them from getting stuck in suboptimal states, such as continuous full charging or discharging. This is achieved through the enforcement of the charging and discharging levels into the feasible action range. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method further maximized the effectiveness of energy storage by actively enhancing its utilization.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Workshop: Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning</p></details> |

Notably, this is also a novel form of tightly coupled map for LiDAR-visual-inertial sensor fusion. This system leverages the complementary characteristics of LiDAR and visual data to capture the geometric structures of large-scale 3D scenes and restore their visual surface information with high fidelity. The initialization for the scene's surface Gaussians and the sensor's poses of each frame are obtained using a LiDAR-inertial system with the feature of size-adaptive voxels. Then, we optimized and refined the Gaussians using visual-derived photometric gradients to optimize their quality and density. Our method is compatible with various types of LiDAR, including solid-state and mechanical LiDAR, supporting both repetitive and non-repetitive scanning modes. Bolstering structure construction through LiDAR and facilitating real-time generation of photorealistic renderings across diverse LIV datasets.

We formulate and present a new local time-stepping (LTS) scheme optimized, in the CFL sense, for the shallow water equations (SWEs). This new scheme, called FB-LTS, is based on the CFL optimized forward-backward Runge-Kutta schemes from Lilly et al. (2023). We show that FB-LTS maintains exact conservation of mass and absolute vorticity when applied to the TRiSK spatial discretization (Ringler et al., 2010), and provide numerical experiments showing that it retains the temporal order of the scheme on which it is based (second order). In terms of computational performance, we show that when applied to a real-world test case on a highly-variable resolution mesh, the MPAS-Ocean implementation of FB-LTS is up to 10 times faster than the classical four-stage, fourth-order Runge-Kutta method (RK4), and 2.3 times faster than an existing strong stability preserving Runge-Kutta based LTS scheme (LTS3). Despite this significant increase in efficiency, the solutions produced by FB-LTS are qualitatively equivalent to those produced by both RK4 and LTS3.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dependent rounding with strong negative-correlation, and scheduling on unrelated machines to minimize completion time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07476v5)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a new dependent-rounding algorithmic framework for bipartite graphs. Given a fractional assignment $\vec x$ of values to edges of graph $G = (U \cup V, E)$, the algorithms return an integral solution $\vec X$ such that each right-node $v \in V$ has at most one neighboring edge $f$ with $X_f = 1$, and where the variables $X_e$ also satisfy broad nonpositive-correlation properties. In particular, for any edges $e_1, e_2$ sharing a left-node $u \in U$, the variables $X_{e_1}, X_{e_2}$ have strong negative-correlation properties, i.e. the expectation of $X_{e_1} X_{e_2}$ is significantly below $x_{e_1} x_{e_2}$. This algorithm is based on generating negatively-correlated Exponential random variables and using them in a contention-resolution scheme inspired by an algorithm Im & Shadloo (2020). Our algorithm gives stronger and much more flexible negative correlation properties. Dependent rounding schemes with negative correlation properties have been used for approximation algorithms for job-scheduling on unrelated machines to minimize weighted completion times (Bansal, Srinivasan, & Svensson (2021), Im & Shadloo (2020), Im & Li (2023)). Using our new dependent-rounding algorithm, among other improvements, we obtain a $1.398$-approximation for this problem. This significantly improves over the prior $1.45$-approximation ratio of Im & Li (2023).</p></details> |  |

To the best of our knowledge, only bi-criteria approximation and exponential-time algorithms follow for this problem from the prior work on fair clustering problems when $\ell > 2$. In our work, focusing on the $\ell > 2$ case, we design the first polynomial-time $(t^{\ell}\cdot \ell\cdot k)^{O(\ell)}$-approximation for this problem with $k$-median cost that does not violate the fairness constraints. We complement our algorithmic result by providing hardness of approximation results, which show that our problem even when $\ell=2$ is almost as hard as the popular uniform capacitated $k$-median, for which no polynomial-time algorithm with an approximation factor of $o(\log k)$ is known.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physics-incorporated Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time Series Imputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10995v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring the missing values is an essential but challenging issue due to the complex latent spatio-temporal correlation and dynamic nature of time series. Owing to the outstanding performance in dealing with structure learning potentials, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are often used to capture such complex spatio-temporal features in multivariate time series. However, these data-driven models often fail to capture the essential spatio-temporal relationships when significant signal corruption occurs. Additionally, calculating the high-order neighbor nodes in these models is of high computational complexity. To address these problems, we propose a novel higher-order spatio-temporal physics-incorporated GNN (HSPGNN). Firstly, the dynamic Laplacian matrix can be obtained by the spatial attention mechanism. Then, the generic inhomogeneous partial differential equation (PDE) of physical dynamic systems is used to construct the dynamic higher-order spatio-temporal GNN to obtain the missing time series values. Moreover, we estimate the missing impact by Normalizing Flows (NF) to evaluate the importance of each node in the graph for better explainability. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of HSPGNN and the superior performance when combining various order neighbor nodes. Also, graph-like optical flow, dynamic graphs, and missing impact can be obtained naturally by HSPGNN, which provides better dynamic analysis and explanation than traditional data-driven models.

However, its application to time series data, particularly within foundational models, remains underexplored. This paper examines the impact of LoRA on contemporary time series foundational models: Lag-Llama, MOIRAI, and Chronos. We demonstrate LoRA's fine-tuning potential for forecasting the vital signs of sepsis patients in intensive care units (ICUs), emphasizing the models' adaptability to previously unseen, out-of-domain modalities. Integrating LoRA aims to enhance forecasting performance while reducing inefficiencies associated with fine-tuning large models on limited domain-specific data. Our experiments show that LoRA fine-tuning of time series foundational models significantly improves forecasting, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art models trained from scratch on similar modalities. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the trade-offs between the number of tunable parameters and forecasting performance and assess the impact of varying LoRA matrix ranks on model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures.

This paper considers the set-up with multiple task requesters and several task executors in a strategic setting. Each task requester has multiple heterogeneous tasks and an estimated budget for the tasks. In our proposed model, the Government has a publicly known fund (or budget) and is limited. Due to limited funds, it may not be possible for the platform to offer the funds to all the available task requesters. For that purpose, in the first tier, the voting by the city dwellers over the task requesters is carried out to decide on the subset of task requesters receiving the Government fund. In the second tier, each task of the task requesters has start and finish times. Based on that, firstly, the tasks are distributed to distinct slots. In each slot, we have multiple task executors for executing the floated tasks. Each task executor reports a cost (private) for completing the floated task(s). Given the above-discussed set-up, the objectives of the second tier are: (1) to schedule each task of the task requesters in the available slots in a non-conflicting manner and (2) to select a set of executors for the available tasks in such a way that the total incentive given to the task executors should be at most the budget for the tasks. For the discussed scenario, a truthful incentive based mechanism is designed that also takes care of budget criteria. Theoretical analysis is done, and it shows that the proposed mechanism is computationally efficient, truthful, budget-feasible, and individually rational. The simulation is carried out, and the efficacy of the designed mechanism is compared with the state-of-the-art mechanisms.</p></details> | 17 pages, 25 figures |
| **[Fast Estimations of Hitting Time of Elitist Evolutionary Algorithms from Fitness Levels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10502v2)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The fitness level method is an easy-to-use tool for estimating the hitting time of elitist evolutionary algorithms. Recently, linear lower and upper bounds by fitness levels have been constructed. But these bounds require recursive computation, which makes them difficult to use in practice. We address this shortcoming with a new directed graph (digraph) method that does not require recursive computation and significantly simplifies the calculation of coefficients in the lower bound. In the method, we select a sub-digraph and divide it into fitness levels, then construct an explicit formula for computing the linear lower bound coefficients using transition probabilities restricted to the subdigraph. A major advantage of the new method is the derivation of tight lower bounds on fitness functions with shortcuts, which are difficult to achieve using previous fitness methods. We use three examples (FullyDeceptive, TwoMax1 and Deceptive) to demonstrate that each new lower bound is tight, but previous lower bounds are not. Our work significantly extends the fitness level method from addressing simple fitness functions without shortcuts to more complex functions with shortcuts.</p></details> |  |

We establish a multivariate strong invariance principle (SIP) for Markov chains associated with these samplers. The rate of this SIP essentially aligns with the tightest rate available for time homogeneous Markov chains. The SIP implies the strong law of large numbers (SLLN) and the central limit theorem (CLT), and plays an essential role in uncertainty assessments. Using the SIP, we give conditions under which the multivariate batch means estimator for estimating the covariance matrix in the multivariate CLT is strongly consistent. Additionally, we provide conditions for a multivariate fixed volume sequential termination rule, which is associated with the concept of effective sample size (ESS), to be asymptotically valid. Our uncertainty assessment tools are demonstrated through various numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |

However, leveraging such pretrained models for video editing is considered a major challenge. Many existing works attempt to enforce temporal consistency in the edited video through explicit correspondence mechanisms, either in pixel space or between deep features. These methods, however, struggle with strong nonrigid motion. In this paper, we introduce a fundamentally different approach, which is based on the observation that spatiotemporal slices of natural videos exhibit similar characteristics to natural images. Thus, the same T2I diffusion model that is normally used only as a prior on video frames, can also serve as a strong prior for enhancing temporal consistency by applying it on spatiotemporal slices. Based on this observation, we present Slicedit, a method for text-based video editing that utilizes a pretrained T2I diffusion model to process both spatial and spatiotemporal slices. Our method generates videos that retain the structure and motion of the original video while adhering to the target text. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate Slicedit's ability to edit a wide range of real-world videos, confirming its clear advantages compared to existing competing methods.

We focus on interfacing these networks with event-based data to perform online spatiotemporal classification and detection with low latency. By virtue of using structured temporal kernels and event-based data, we have the freedom to vary the sample rate of the data along with the discretization step-size of the network without additional finetuning. We experimented with three event-based benchmarks and obtained state-of-the-art results on all three by large margins with significantly smaller memory and compute costs. We achieved: 1) 99.59% accuracy with 192K parameters on the DVS128 hand gesture recognition dataset and 100% with a small additional output filter; 2) 99.58% test accuracy with 277K parameters on the AIS 2024 eye tracking challenge; and 3) 0.556 mAP with 576k parameters on the PROPHESEE 1 Megapixel Automotive Detection Dataset.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[UniST: A Prompt-Empowered Universal Model for Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11838v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for informed decision-making, such as transportation management, resource optimization, and urban planning. Although pretrained foundation models for natural languages have experienced remarkable breakthroughs, wherein one general-purpose model can tackle multiple tasks across various domains, urban spatio-temporal modeling lags behind. Existing approaches for urban prediction are usually tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive in-domain training data. In this work, we propose a universal model, UniST, for urban spatio-temporal prediction. Drawing inspiration from large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) flexibility towards diverse spatio-temporal data characteristics, (ii) effective generative pre-training with elaborated masking strategies to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, (iii) spatio-temporal knowledge-guided prompts that align and leverage intrinsic and shared knowledge across scenarios. These designs together unlock the potential of a one-for-all model for spatio-temporal prediction with powerful generalization capability. Extensive experiments on 15 cities and 6 domains demonstrate the universality of UniST in advancing state-of-the-art prediction performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

| **[A Temporal Stochastic Bias Correction using a Machine Learning Attention model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14169v4)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate models are biased with respect to real-world observations. They usually need to be adjusted before being used in impact studies. The suite of statistical methods that enable such adjustments is called bias correction (BC). However, BC methods currently struggle to adjust temporal biases. Because they mostly disregard the dependence between consecutive time points. As a result, climate statistics with long-range temporal properties, such as heatwave duration and frequency, cannot be corrected accurately. This makes it more difficult to produce reliable impact studies on such climate statistics. This paper offers a novel BC methodology to correct temporal biases. This is made possible by rethinking the philosophy behind BC. We will introduce BC as a time-indexed regression task with stochastic outputs. Rethinking BC enables us to adapt state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) attention models and thereby learn different types of biases, including temporal asynchronicities. With a case study of heatwave duration statistics in Abuja, Nigeria, and Tokyo, Japan, we show more accurate results than current climate model outputs and alternative BC methods.</p></details> | 38 pages, 31 figures |
| **[An Analysis of Quantile Temporal-Difference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04462v3)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyse quantile temporal-difference learning (QTD), a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm that has proven to be a key component in several successful large-scale applications of reinforcement learning. Despite these empirical successes, a theoretical understanding of QTD has proven elusive until now. Unlike classical TD learning, which can be analysed with standard stochastic approximation tools, QTD updates do not approximate contraction mappings, are highly non-linear, and may have multiple fixed points. The core result of this paper is a proof of convergence to the fixed points of a related family of dynamic programming procedures with probability 1, putting QTD on firm theoretical footing. The proof establishes connections between QTD and non-linear differential inclusions through stochastic approximation theory and non-smooth analysis.</p></details> | Accepted to JMLR |

However, susceptibility to various physiological and environmental artifacts introduces noise in recorded EEG data, impeding accurate analysis of underlying brain activity. Denoising techniques are crucial to mitigate this challenge. Recent advancements in deep learningbased approaches exhibit substantial potential for enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio of EEG data compared to traditional methods. In the realm of large-scale language models (LLMs), the Retentive Network (Retnet) infrastructure, prevalent for some models, demonstrates robust feature extraction and global modeling capabilities. Recognizing the temporal similarities between EEG signals and natural language, we introduce the Retnet from natural language processing to EEG denoising. This integration presents a novel approach to EEG denoising, opening avenues for a profound understanding of brain activities and accurate diagnosis of neurological diseases. Nonetheless, direct application of Retnet to EEG denoising is unfeasible due to the one-dimensional nature of EEG signals, while natural language processing deals with two-dimensional data. To facilitate Retnet application to EEG denoising, we propose the signal embedding method, transforming one-dimensional EEG signals into two dimensions for use as network inputs. Experimental results validate the substantial improvement in denoising effectiveness achieved by the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

It is difficult for a low-rigidity robot to handle its own body as intended compared to a rigid robot, and calibration between vision and body takes some time. In addition, the robot must constantly adapt to changes in its body, such as the change in camera position and change in joints due to aging. Therefore, we develop a method for a low-rigidity robot to autonomously learn visual servoing of its body. We also develop a mechanism that can adaptively change its visual servoing according to temporal body changes. We apply our method to a low-rigidity 6-axis arm, MyCobot, and confirm its effectiveness by conducting object grasping experiments based on visual servoing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |

The installation is a form of creative computing experience that departs from the traditional focus on office technologies for productivity. Drawing on neuroscience insights and the slowing effect of nature sounds on time perception, we created an immersive, slow interaction, generative AI installation that composes an audiovisual space - serving as a perceptual portal into temporal realms beyond the linear rhythm of the office. Our study investigates the lived experiences of 18 office workers, gathered via explicitation interviews, observational notes, and video recordings, analysed through an inductive thematic analysis. Key findings highlight the ephemeral qualities in creative computing experiences using generative AI, its potential to foster contemplative practices, amplify ecological temporalities, and reshape office workers' engagement with their environment. Our design and user study offer research and practical implications for utilising creative computing to enrich office experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper to be published at ICCC'24</p></details> |
| **[Multi-level Temporal-channel Speaker Retrieval for Zero-shot Voice Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07204v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot voice conversion (VC) converts source speech into the voice of any desired speaker using only one utterance of the speaker without requiring additional model updates. Typical methods use a speaker representation from a pre-trained speaker verification (SV) model or learn speaker representation during VC training to achieve zero-shot VC. However, existing speaker modeling methods overlook the variation of speaker information richness in temporal and frequency channel dimensions of speech. This insufficient speaker modeling hampers the ability of the VC model to accurately represent unseen speakers who are not in the training dataset. In this study, we present a robust zero-shot VC model with multi-level temporal-channel retrieval, referred to as MTCR-VC. Specifically, to flexibly adapt to the dynamic-variant speaker characteristic in the temporal and channel axis of the speech, we propose a novel fine-grained speaker modeling method, called temporal-channel retrieval (TCR), to find out when and where speaker information appears in speech. It retrieves variable-length speaker representation from both temporal and channel dimensions under the guidance of a pre-trained SV model. Besides, inspired by the hierarchical process of human speech production, the MTCR speaker module stacks several TCR blocks to extract speaker representations from multi-granularity levels. Furthermore, to achieve better speech disentanglement and reconstruction, we introduce a cycle-based training strategy to simulate zero-shot inference recurrently. We adopt perpetual constraints on three aspects, including content, style, and speaker, to drive this process. Experiments demonstrate that MTCR-VC is superior to the previous zero-shot VC methods in modeling speaker timbre while maintaining good speech naturalness.</p></details> | Submitted to TASLP |
| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[Ensuring Safety at Intelligent Intersections: Temporal Logic Meets Reachability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11300v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose an approach for ensuring the safety of vehicles passing through an intelligent intersection. There are many proposals for the design of intelligent intersections that introduce central decision-makers to intersections for enhancing the efficiency and safety of the vehicles. To guarantee the safety of such designs, we develop a safety framework for intersections based on temporal logic and reachability analysis. We start by specifying the required behavior for all the vehicles that need to pass through the intersection as linear temporal logic formula. Then, using temporal logic trees, we break down the linear temporal logic specification into a series of Hamilton-Jacobi reachability analyses in an automated fashion. By successfully constructing the temporal logic tree through reachability analysis, we verify the feasibility of the intersection specification. By taking this approach, we enable a safety framework that is able to automatically provide safety guarantees on new intersection behavior specifications. To evaluate our approach, we implement the framework on a simulated T-intersection, where we show that we can check and guarantee the safety of vehicles with potentially conflicting paths.</p></details> |  |
| **[STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12418v4)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time. The implementation code is available at: \url{https://github.com/LincanLi98/STG-Mamba}.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Model for Traffic Flow Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13257v2)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction, a critical aspect of intelligent transportation systems, has been increasingly popular in the field of artificial intelligence, driven by the availability of extensive traffic data. The current challenges of traffic flow prediction lie in integrating diverse factors while balancing the trade-off between computational complexity and the precision necessary for effective long-range and large-scale predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-Mamba) model, which is the first to leverage the power of spatial-temporal learning in traffic flow prediction without using graph modeling. The ST-Mamba model can effectively capture the long-range dependency for traffic flow data, thereby avoiding the issue of over-smoothing. The proposed ST-Mamba model incorporates an effective Spatial-Temporal Mixer (ST-Mixer) to seamlessly integrate spatial and temporal data processing into a unified framework and employs a Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space (ST-SSM) block to improve computational efficiency. The proposed ST-Mamba model, specifically designed for spatial-temporal data, simplifies processing procedure and enhances generalization capabilities, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of long-range traffic flow prediction. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) model, the proposed ST-Mamba model achieves a 61.11\% improvement in computational speed and increases prediction accuracy by 0.67\%. Extensive experiments with real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the \textsf{ST-Mamba} model sets a new benchmark in traffic flow prediction, achieving SOTA performance in computational efficiency for both long- and short-range predictions and significantly improving the overall efficiency and effectiveness of traffic management.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Within the context of solar radiation, the changing climate may have an effect on photovoltaic (PV) production, especially as the PV industry moves to extend plant lifetimes to 50 years. Predicting PV production while taking into account a changing climate requires data at a resolution that is useful for building PV plants. Although temporal and spatial downscaling of solar radiation data is widely studied, we present a novel method to downscale solar radiation data from daily averages to hourly profiles, while maintaining spatial correlation of parameters characterizing the diurnal profile of solar radiation. The method focuses on the use of a diurnal template which can be shifted and scaled according to the time or year and location and the use of thin plate splines for spatial downscaling. This analysis is applied to data from the National Solar Radiation Database housed at the National Renewable Energy Lab and a case study of the mentioned methods over several sub-regions of continental United States is presented.</p></details> | 35 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Synthesis of Temporal Causality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10912v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an automata-based algorithm to synthesize omega-regular causes for omega-regular effects on executions of a reactive system, such as counterexamples uncovered by a model checker. Our theory is a generalization of temporal causality, which has recently been proposed as a framework for drawing causal relationships between trace properties on a given trace. So far, algorithms exist only for verifying a single causal relationship and, as an extension, cause synthesis through enumeration, which is complete only for a small fragment of effect properties. This work presents the first complete cause-synthesis algorithm for the class of omega-regular effects. We show that in this case, causes are guaranteed to be omega-regular themselves and can be computed as, e.g., nondeterministic B\"uchi automata. We demonstrate the practical feasibility of this algorithm with a prototype tool and evaluate its performance for cause synthesis and cause checking.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-World Graph Analysis: Techniques for Static, Dynamic, and Temporal Communities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10824v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphs are widely used in various fields of computer science. They have also found application in unrelated areas, leading to a diverse range of problems. These problems can be modeled as relationships between entities in various contexts, such as social networks, protein interactions in cells, and route maps. Therefore it is logical to analyze these data structures with diverse approaches, whether they are numerical or structural, global or local, approximate or exact. In particular, the concept of community plays an important role in local structural analysis, as it is able to highlight the composition of the underlying graph while providing insights into what the organization and importance of the nodes in a network look like. This thesis pursues the goal of extracting knowledge from different kinds of graphs, including static, dynamic, and temporal graphs, with a particular focus on their community substructures. To tackle this task we use combinatorial algorithms that can list all the communities in a graph according to different formalizations, such as cliques, $k$-graphlets, and $k$-cores. We first develop new algorithms to enumerate subgraphs, using traditional and novel techniques such as push-out amortization, and CPU cache analysis to boost their efficiency. We then extend these concepts to the analysis of real-world graphs across diverse domains, ranging from social networks to autonomous systems modeled as temporal graphs. In this field, there is currently no widely accepted adaptation, even for straightforward subgraphs like $k$-cores, and the available data is expanding both in terms of quantity and scale. As a result, our findings advance the state of the art both from a theoretical and a practical perspective and can be used in a static or dynamic setting to further speed up and refine graph analysis techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[STLCCP: An Efficient Convex Optimization-based Framework for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09441v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is capable of expressing a broad range of temporal properties that controlled dynamical systems must satisfy. In the literature, both mixed-integer programming (MIP) and nonlinear programming (NLP) methods have been applied to solve optimal control problems with STL specifications. However, neither approach has succeeded in solving problems with complex long-horizon STL specifications within a realistic timeframe. This study proposes a new optimization framework, called \textit{STLCCP}, which explicitly incorporates several structures of STL to mitigate this issue. The core of our framework is a structure-aware decomposition of STL formulas, which converts the original program into a difference of convex (DC) programs. This program is then solved as a convex quadratic program sequentially, based on the convex-concave procedure (CCP). Our numerical experiments on several commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that this framework can effectively handle complex scenarios over long horizons, which have been challenging to address even using state-of-the-art optimization methods.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Historically Relevant Event Structuring for Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10621v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Knowledge Graph (TKG) reasoning focuses on predicting events through historical information within snapshots distributed on a timeline. Existing studies mainly concentrate on two perspectives of leveraging the history of TKGs, including capturing evolution of each recent snapshot or correlations among global historical facts. Despite the achieved significant accomplishments, these models still fall short of (1) investigating the influences of multi-granularity interactions across recent snapshots and (2) harnessing the expressive semantics of significant links accorded with queries throughout the entire history, especially events exerting a profound impact on the future. These inadequacies restrict representation ability to reflect historical dependencies and future trends thoroughly. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an innovative TKG reasoning approach towards \textbf{His}torically \textbf{R}elevant \textbf{E}vents \textbf{S}tructuring ($\mathsf{HisRES}$). Concretely, $\mathsf{HisRES}$ comprises two distinctive modules excelling in structuring historically relevant events within TKGs, including a multi-granularity evolutionary encoder that captures structural and temporal dependencies of the most recent snapshots, and a global relevance encoder that concentrates on crucial correlations among events relevant to queries from the entire history. Furthermore, $\mathsf{HisRES}$ incorporates a self-gating mechanism for adaptively merging multi-granularity recent and historically relevant structuring representations. Extensive experiments on four event-based benchmarks demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of $\mathsf{HisRES}$ and indicate the superiority and effectiveness of structuring historical relevance for TKG reasoning.</p></details> |  |

LLMs often struggle with this task, leading to the generation of inaccurate or misleading responses. This issue mainly arises from their limited ability to handle evolving factual knowledge and complex temporal logic. To overcome these limitations, we propose Abstract Reasoning Induction (ARI) framework, which divides temporal reasoning into two distinct phases: Knowledge-agnostic and Knowledge-based. This framework offers factual knowledge support to LLMs while minimizing the incorporation of extraneous noisy data. Concurrently, informed by the principles of constructivism, ARI provides LLMs the capability to engage in proactive, self-directed learning from both correct and incorrect historical reasoning samples. By teaching LLMs to actively construct knowledge and methods, it can significantly boosting their temporal reasoning abilities. Our approach achieves remarkable improvements, with relative gains of 29.7% and 9.27% on two temporal QA datasets, underscoring its efficacy in advancing temporal reasoning in LLMs. The code can be found at https://github.com/czy1999/ARI-QA</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2024. 17 pages, 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[How Can Large Language Models Understand Spatial-Temporal Data?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14192v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) dominate tasks like natural language processing and computer vision, harnessing their power for spatial-temporal forecasting remains challenging. The disparity between sequential text and complex spatial-temporal data hinders this application. To address this issue, this paper introduces STG-LLM, an innovative approach empowering LLMs for spatial-temporal forecasting. We tackle the data mismatch by proposing: 1) STG-Tokenizer: This spatial-temporal graph tokenizer transforms intricate graph data into concise tokens capturing both spatial and temporal relationships; 2) STG-Adapter: This minimalistic adapter, consisting of linear encoding and decoding layers, bridges the gap between tokenized data and LLM comprehension. By fine-tuning only a small set of parameters, it can effectively grasp the semantics of tokens generated by STG-Tokenizer, while preserving the original natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Extensive experiments on diverse spatial-temporal benchmark datasets show that STG-LLM successfully unlocks LLM potential for spatial-temporal forecasting.

Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction. In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text. Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts. In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. To this end, we introduce TSDRE, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset. Our experiments show that TSDRE achieves state-of-the-art results on both HyperRED-Temporal and ComplexTRED datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Temporal-Spatial Object Relations Modeling for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15691v2)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task where an agent is required to navigate to a natural language described location via vision observations. The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMCEN: An Attention Masking-based Contrastive Event Network for Two-stage Temporal Knowledge Graph Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10346v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal knowledge graphs (TKGs) can effectively model the ever-evolving nature of real-world knowledge, and their completeness and enhancement can be achieved by reasoning new events from existing ones. However, reasoning accuracy is adversely impacted due to an imbalance between new and recurring events in the datasets. To achieve more accurate TKG reasoning, we propose an attention masking-based contrastive event network (AMCEN) with local-global temporal patterns for the two-stage prediction of future events. In the network, historical and non-historical attention mask vectors are designed to control the attention bias towards historical and non-historical entities, acting as the key to alleviating the imbalance. A local-global message-passing module is proposed to comprehensively consider and capture multi-hop structural dependencies and local-global temporal evolution for the in-depth exploration of latent impact factors of different event types. A contrastive event classifier is used to classify events more accurately by incorporating local-global temporal patterns into contrastive learning. Therefore, AMCEN refines the prediction scope with the results of the contrastive event classification, followed by utilizing attention masking-based decoders to finalize the specific outcomes. The results of our experiments on four benchmark datasets highlight the superiority of AMCEN. Especially, the considerable improvements in Hits@1 prove that AMCEN can make more precise predictions about future occurrences.</p></details> |  |

| **[Easy attention: A simple attention mechanism for temporal predictions with transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12874v3)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To improve the robustness of transformer neural networks used for temporal-dynamics prediction of chaotic systems, we propose a novel attention mechanism called easy attention which we demonstrate in time-series reconstruction and prediction. While the standard self attention only makes use of the inner product of queries and keys, it is demonstrated that the keys, queries and softmax are not necessary for obtaining the attention score required to capture long-term dependencies in temporal sequences. Through the singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the softmax attention score, we further observe that self attention compresses the contributions from both queries and keys in the space spanned by the attention score. Therefore, our proposed easy-attention method directly treats the attention scores as learnable parameters. This approach produces excellent results when reconstructing and predicting the temporal dynamics of chaotic systems exhibiting more robustness and less complexity than self attention or the widely-used long short-term memory (LSTM) network. We show the improved performance of the easy-attention method in the Lorenz system, a turbulence shear flow and a model of a nuclear reactor.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 6 figures</p></details> |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the US, which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood hematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukemia and lymphoma.</p></details> |  |

Our method advances existing pose estimation frameworks by improving robustness and flexibility without requiring direct 3D annotations. At the core of our method, a pose compiler module refines predictions from a 2D keypoints estimator that operates on a single image by leveraging temporal and cross-view information. Our novel cross-view fusion strategy is scalable to any number of cameras, while our synthetic data generation strategy ensures generalization across diverse actors, scenes, and viewpoints. Finally, UPose3D leverages the prediction uncertainty of both the 2D keypoint estimator and the pose compiler module. This provides robustness to outliers and noisy data, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in out-of-distribution settings. In addition, for in-distribution settings, UPose3D yields a performance rivaling methods that rely on 3D annotated data, while being the state-of-the-art among methods relying only on 2D supervision.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is an expressive formal language used to describe spatial-temporal properties with interpretability. This paper introduces TLINet, a neural-symbolic framework for learning STL formulas. The computation in TLINet is differentiable, enabling the usage of off-the-shelf gradient-based tools during the learning process. In contrast to existing approaches, we introduce approximation methods for max operator designed specifically for temporal logic-based gradient techniques, ensuring the correctness of STL satisfaction evaluation. Our framework not only learns the structure but also the parameters of STL formulas, allowing flexible combinations of operators and various logical structures. We validate TLINet against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating that our approach outperforms these baselines in terms of interpretability, compactness, rich expressibility, and computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Temporal Interpretation of Cluster Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01103v3)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The NP-complete graph problem Cluster Editing seeks to transform a static graph into a disjoint union of cliques by making the fewest possible edits to the edges. We introduce a natural interpretation of this problem in temporal graphs, whose edge sets change over time. This problem is NP-complete even when restricted to temporal graphs whose underlying graph is a path, but we obtain two polynomial-time algorithms for restricted cases. In the static setting, it is well-known that a graph is a disjoint union of cliques if and only if it contains no induced copy of $P_3$; we demonstrate that no general characterisation involving sets of at most four vertices can exist in the temporal setting, but obtain a complete characterisation involving forbidden configurations on at most five vertices. This characterisation gives rise to an FPT algorithm parameterised simultaneously by the permitted number of modifications and the lifetime of the temporal graph.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures.

| **[TAnet: A New Temporal Attention Network for EEG-based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding with a Short Decision Window](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05819v2)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auditory spatial attention detection (ASAD) is used to determine the direction of a listener's attention to a speaker by analyzing her/his electroencephalographic (EEG) signals. This study aimed to further improve the performance of ASAD with a short decision window (i.e., <1 s) rather than with long decision windows ranging from 1 to 5 seconds in previous studies. An end-to-end temporal attention network (i.e., TAnet) was introduced in this work. TAnet employs a multi-head attention (MHA) mechanism, which can more effectively capture the interactions among time steps in collected EEG signals and efficiently assign corresponding weights to those EEG time steps. Experiments demonstrated that, compared with the CNN-based method and recent ASAD methods, TAnet provided improved decoding performance in the KUL dataset, with decoding accuracies of 92.4% (decision window 0.1 s), 94.9% (0.25 s), 95.1% (0.3 s), 95.4% (0.4 s), and 95.5% (0.5 s) with short decision windows (i.e., <1 s). As a new ASAD model with a short decision window, TAnet can potentially facilitate the design of EEG-controlled intelligent hearing aids and sound recognition systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating LLMs at Evaluating Temporal Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08460v1)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the urgent need for evolving evaluation methodologies that keep pace with improvements in language comprehension and information processing. However, traditional benchmarks, which are often static, fail to capture the continually changing information landscape, leading to a disparity between the perceived and actual effectiveness of LLMs in ever-changing real-world scenarios. Furthermore, these benchmarks do not adequately measure the models' capabilities over a broader temporal range or their adaptability over time. We examine current LLMs in terms of temporal generalization and bias, revealing that various temporal biases emerge in both language likelihood and prognostic prediction. This serves as a caution for LLM practitioners to pay closer attention to mitigating temporal biases. Also, we propose an evaluation framework Freshbench for dynamically generating benchmarks from the most recent real-world prognostication prediction. Our code is available at https://github.com/FreedomIntelligence/FreshBench. The dataset will be released soon.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, previous delay predictions are often categorical and at a highly aggregated level. To improve that, this study proposes to apply the novel Temporal Fusion Transformer model and predict numerical airport arrival delays at quarter hour level for U.S. top 30 airports. Inputs to our model include airport demand and capacity forecasts, historic airport operation efficiency information, airport wind and visibility conditions, as well as enroute weather and traffic conditions. The results show that our model achieves satisfactory performance measured by small prediction errors on the test set. In addition, the interpretability analysis of the model outputs identifies the important input factors for delay prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[A predictive learning model can simulate temporal dynamics and context effects found in neural representations of continuous speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08237v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech perception involves storing and integrating sequentially presented items. Recent work in cognitive neuroscience has identified temporal and contextual characteristics in humans' neural encoding of speech that may facilitate this temporal processing. In this study, we simulated similar analyses with representations extracted from a computational model that was trained on unlabelled speech with the learning objective of predicting upcoming acoustics. Our simulations revealed temporal dynamics similar to those in brain signals, implying that these properties can arise without linguistic knowledge. Another property shared between brains and the model is that the encoding patterns of phonemes support some degree of cross-context generalization. However, we found evidence that the effectiveness of these generalizations depends on the specific contexts, which suggests that this analysis alone is insufficient to support the presence of context-invariant encoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CogSci 2024</p></details> |
| **[A Tidy Framework and Infrastructure to Systematically Assemble Spatio-temporal Indexes from Multivariate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05812v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Interest Network for User Response Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08487v3)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User response prediction is essential in industrial recommendation systems, such as online display advertising. Among all the features in recommendation models, user behaviors are among the most critical. Many works have revealed that a user's behavior reflects her interest in the candidate item, owing to the semantic or temporal correlation between behaviors and the candidate. While the literature has individually examined each of these correlations, researchers have yet to analyze them in combination, that is, the semantic-temporal correlation. We empirically measure this correlation and observe intuitive yet robust patterns. We then examine several popular user interest models and find that, surprisingly, none of them learn such correlation well. To fill this gap, we propose a Temporal Interest Network (TIN) to capture the semantic-temporal correlation simultaneously between behaviors and the target. We achieve this by incorporating target-aware temporal encoding, in addition to semantic encoding, to represent behaviors and the target. Furthermore, we conduct explicit 4-way interaction by deploying target-aware attention and target-aware representation to capture both semantic and temporal correlation. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on two popular public datasets, and our proposed TIN outperforms the best-performing baselines by 0.43% and 0.29% on GAUC, respectively. During online A/B testing in Tencent's advertising platform, TIN achieves 1.65% cost lift and 1.93% GMV lift over the base model. It has been successfully deployed in production since October 2023, serving the WeChat Moments traffic. We have released our code at https://github.com/zhouxy1003/TIN.</p></details> |  |

In first-order modal logic, definite descriptions have been widely investigated for their non-rigidity, which allows them to designate different objects (or none at all) at different states. We propose expressive modal description logics with non-rigid definite descriptions and names, and investigate decidability and complexity of the satisfaction problem. We first systematically link satisfiability for the one-variable fragment of first-order modal logic with counting to our modal description logics. Then, we prove a promising NEXPTIME-completeness result for concept satisfiability for the fundamental epistemic multi-agent logic $\mathbf{S5}^{n}$ and its neighbours, and show that some expressive logics that are undecidable with constant domain become decidable (but Ackermann-hard) with expanding domains. Finally, we conduct a fine-grained analysis of decidability of temporal logics.</p></details> |  |
| **[TUNeS: A Temporal U-Net with Self-Attention for Video-based Surgical Phase Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09997v4)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enable context-aware computer assistance in the operating room of the future, cognitive systems need to understand automatically which surgical phase is being performed by the medical team. The primary source of information for surgical phase recognition is typically video, which presents two challenges: extracting meaningful features from the video stream and effectively modeling temporal information in the sequence of visual features. For temporal modeling, attention mechanisms have gained popularity due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies. In this paper, we explore design choices for attention in existing temporal models for surgical phase recognition and propose a novel approach that uses attention more effectively and does not require hand-crafted constraints: TUNeS, an efficient and simple temporal model that incorporates self-attention at the core of a convolutional U-Net structure. In addition, we propose to train the feature extractor, a standard CNN, together with an LSTM on preferably long video segments, i.e., with long temporal context. In our experiments, almost all temporal models performed better on top of feature extractors that were trained with longer temporal context. On these contextualized features, TUNeS achieves state-of-the-art results on the Cholec80 dataset. This study offers new insights on how to use attention mechanisms to build accurate and efficient temporal models for surgical phase recognition. Implementing automatic surgical phase recognition is essential to automate the analysis and optimization of surgical workflows and to enable context-aware computer assistance during surgery, thus ultimately improving patient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code released at https://gitlab.com/nct_tso_public/tunes</p></details> |

However, the pursuit of accuracy in current studies leads to large, long-timestep SNNs, conflicting with the resource constraints of these devices. In order to design lightweight and efficient SNNs, we propose a new approach named LitE-SNN that incorporates both spatial and temporal compression into the automated network design process. Spatially, we present a novel Compressive Convolution block (CompConv) to expand the search space to support pruning and mixed-precision quantization. Temporally, we are the first to propose a compressive timestep search to identify the optimal number of timesteps under specific computation cost constraints. Finally, we formulate a joint optimization to simultaneously learn the architecture parameters and spatial-temporal compression strategies to achieve high performance while minimizing memory and computation costs. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Google Speech Command datasets demonstrate our proposed LitE-SNNs can achieve competitive or even higher accuracy with remarkably smaller model sizes and fewer computation costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Motion Keyframe Interpolation for Any Human Skeleton via Temporally Consistent Point Cloud Sampling and Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07444v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the character animation field, modern supervised keyframe interpolation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in constructing natural human motions from sparse pose definitions. As supervised models, large motion datasets are necessary to facilitate the learning process; however, since motion is represented with fixed hierarchical skeletons, such datasets are incompatible for skeletons outside the datasets' native configurations. Consequently, the expected availability of a motion dataset for desired skeletons severely hinders the feasibility of learned interpolation in practice. To combat this limitation, we propose Point Cloud-based Motion Representation Learning (PC-MRL), an unsupervised approach to enabling cross-compatibility between skeletons for motion interpolation learning. PC-MRL consists of a skeleton obfuscation strategy using temporal point cloud sampling, and an unsupervised skeleton reconstruction method from point clouds. We devise a temporal point-wise K-nearest neighbors loss for unsupervised learning. Moreover, we propose First-frame Offset Quaternion (FOQ) and Rest Pose Augmentation (RPA) strategies to overcome necessary limitations of our unsupervised point cloud-to-skeletal motion process. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of PC-MRL in motion interpolation for desired skeletons without supervision from native datasets.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |

TKANs combined the strenght of both networks, it is composed of Recurring Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (RKANs) Layers embedding memory management. This innovation enables us to perform multi-step time series forecasting with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By addressing the limitations of traditional models in handling complex sequential patterns, the TKAN architecture offers significant potential for advancements in fields requiring more than one step ahead forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTRL: Continuous-Time Representation Learning on Temporal Heterogeneous Information Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08013v1)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive representation learning on temporal heterogeneous graphs is crucial for scalable deep learning on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) which are time-varying, such as citation networks. However, most existing approaches are not inductive and thus cannot handle new nodes or edges. Moreover, previous temporal graph embedding methods are often trained with the temporal link prediction task to simulate the link formation process of temporal graphs, while ignoring the evolution of high-order topological structures on temporal graphs. To fill these gaps, we propose a Continuous-Time Representation Learning (CTRL) model on temporal HINs. To preserve heterogeneous node features and temporal structures, CTRL integrates three parts in a single layer, they are 1) a \emph{heterogeneous attention} unit that measures the semantic correlation between nodes, 2) a \emph{edge-based Hawkes process} to capture temporal influence between heterogeneous nodes, and 3) \emph{dynamic centrality} that indicates the dynamic importance of a node. We train the CTRL model with a future event (a subgraph) prediction task to capture the evolution of the high-order network structure. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three benchmark datasets. The results demonstrate that our model significantly boosts performance and outperforms various state-of-the-art approaches. Ablation studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the model design.</p></details> |  |
| **[FineParser: A Fine-grained Spatio-temporal Action Parser for Human-centric Action Quality Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06887v1)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing action quality assessment (AQA) methods mainly learn deep representations at the video level for scoring diverse actions. Due to the lack of a fine-grained understanding of actions in videos, they harshly suffer from low credibility and interpretability, thus insufficient for stringent applications, such as Olympic diving events. We argue that a fine-grained understanding of actions requires the model to perceive and parse actions in both time and space, which is also the key to the credibility and interpretability of the AQA technique. Based on this insight, we propose a new fine-grained spatial-temporal action parser named \textbf{FineParser}. It learns human-centric foreground action representations by focusing on target action regions within each frame and exploiting their fine-grained alignments in time and space to minimize the impact of invalid backgrounds during the assessment. In addition, we construct fine-grained annotations of human-centric foreground action masks for the FineDiving dataset, called \textbf{FineDiving-HM}. With refined annotations on diverse target action procedures, FineDiving-HM can promote the development of real-world AQA systems. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of FineParser, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods while supporting more tasks of fine-grained action understanding.

They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |
| **[A Multi-Channel Spatial-Temporal Transformer Model for Traffic Flow Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06266v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial task in transportation management and planning. The main challenges for traffic flow forecasting are that (1) as the length of prediction time increases, the accuracy of prediction will decrease; (2) the predicted results greatly rely on the extraction of temporal and spatial dependencies from the road networks. To overcome the challenges mentioned above, we propose a multi-channel spatial-temporal transformer model for traffic flow forecasting, which improves the accuracy of the prediction by fusing results from different channels of traffic data. Our approach leverages graph convolutional network to extract spatial features from each channel while using a transformer-based architecture to capture temporal dependencies across channels. We introduce an adaptive adjacency matrix to overcome limitations in feature extraction from fixed topological structures. Experimental results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that introducing a multi-channel mechanism into the temporal model enhances performance and our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[An MRP Formulation for Supervised Learning: Generalized Temporal Difference Learning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15518v2)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In traditional statistical learning, data points are usually assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) following an unknown probability distribution. This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis draws connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). We also show that under specific conditions, particularly when noises are correlated, the TD's solution proves to be a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we establish the convergence of our generalized TD algorithms under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a novel view that treats inducing temporal action abstractions as a sequence compression problem. To do so, we bring a subtle but critical component of LLM training pipelines -- input tokenization via byte pair encoding (BPE) -- to the seemingly distant task of learning skills of variable time span in continuous control domains. We introduce an approach called Primitive Sequence Encoding (PRISE) that combines continuous action quantization with BPE to learn powerful action abstractions. We empirically show that high-level skills discovered by PRISE from a multitask set of robotic manipulation demonstrations significantly boost the performance of both multitask imitation learning as well as few-shot imitation learning on unseen tasks. Our code will be released at https://github.com/FrankZheng2022/PRISE.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art methods for detecting coordinated behavior perform static analyses, disregarding the temporal dynamics of coordination. Here, we carry out the first dynamic analysis of coordinated behavior. To reach our goal we build a multiplex temporal network and we perform dynamic community detection to identify groups of users that exhibited coordinated behaviors in time. Thanks to our novel approach we find that: (i) coordinated communities feature variable degrees of temporal instability; (ii) dynamic analyses are needed to account for such instability, and results of static analyses can be unreliable and scarcely representative of unstable communities; (iii) some users exhibit distinct archetypal behaviors that have important practical implications; (iv) content and network characteristics contribute to explaining why users leave and join coordinated communities. Our results demonstrate the advantages of dynamic analyses and open up new directions of research on the unfolding of online debates, on the strategies of coordinated communities, and on the patterns of online influence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artic...</summary><p>Article published in PNAS 121 (20).

The integration of attention mechanisms, inspired by advancements in neural network architectures, has led to the development of Spiking Transformers. These have shown promise in enhancing SNNs' capabilities, particularly in the realms of both static and neuromorphic datasets. Despite their progress, a discernible gap exists in these systems, specifically in the Spiking Self Attention (SSA) mechanism's effectiveness in leveraging the temporal processing potential of SNNs. To address this, we introduce the Temporal Interaction Module (TIM), a novel, convolution-based enhancement designed to augment the temporal data processing abilities within SNN architectures. TIM's integration into existing SNN frameworks is seamless and efficient, requiring minimal additional parameters while significantly boosting their temporal information handling capabilities. Through rigorous experimentation, TIM has demonstrated its effectiveness in exploiting temporal information, leading to state-of-the-art performance across various neuromorphic datasets.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Positional Recovery Training framework (Port), which prompts the model with the start and end times of specific animal behaviors during training. Specifically, Port enhances the baseline model with a Recovering part to predict flipped label sequences and align distributions with a Dual-alignment method. This allows the model to focus on specific temporal regions prompted by ground-truth information. Extensive experiments on the Animal Kingdom dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of Port, achieving an IoU@0.3 of 38.52. It emerges as one of the top performers in the sub-track of MMVRAC in ICME 2024 Grand Challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICMEW 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2404.13657</p></details> |

However, the indiscriminate temporal fusion method will cause the barrier of feature redundancy when constructing vectorized High-Definition (HD) maps. In this paper, we revisit the temporal fusion of vectorized HD maps, focusing on temporal instance consistency and temporal map consistency learning. To improve the representation of instances in single-frame maps, we introduce a novel method, DTCLMapper. This approach uses a dual-stream temporal consistency learning module that combines instance embedding with geometry maps. In the instance embedding component, our approach integrates temporal Instance Consistency Learning (ICL), ensuring consistency from vector points and instance features aggregated from points. A vectorized points pre-selection module is employed to enhance the regression efficiency of vector points from each instance. Then aggregated instance features obtained from the vectorized points preselection module are grounded in contrastive learning to realize temporal consistency, where positive and negative samples are selected based on position and semantic information. The geometry mapping component introduces Map Consistency Learning (MCL) designed with self-supervised learning. The MCL enhances the generalization capability of our consistent learning approach by concentrating on the global location and distribution constraints of the instances. Extensive experiments on well-recognized benchmarks indicate that the proposed DTCLMapper achieves state-of-the-art performance in vectorized mapping tasks, reaching 61.9% and 65.1% mAP scores on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, respectively.

Dynamic object tracking performance can be improved if robots share observations of tracked objects with nearby team members in real-time. To share observations, a robot must make up-to-date estimates of the transformation from its coordinate frame to the frame of each neighbor, which can be challenging because of odometry drift. We present Multiple Object Tracking with Localization Error Elimination (MOTLEE), a complete system for a multi-robot team to accurately estimate frame transformations and collaboratively track dynamic objects. To accomplish this, robots use open-set image-segmentation methods to build object maps of their environment and then use our Temporally Consistent Alignment of Frames Filter (TCAFF) to align maps and estimate coordinate frame transformations without any initial knowledge of neighboring robot poses. We show that our method for aligning frames enables a team of four robots to collaboratively track six pedestrians with accuracy similar to that of a system with ground truth localization in a challenging hardware demonstration. The code and hardware dataset are available at https://github.com/mit-acl/motlee.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

In the case of complex road networks, current and past traffic information from both upstream and downstream roads are crucial since various road networks have different semantic information about traffic. Rationalizing the utilization of semantic information can realize short-term, long-term, and unseen road traffic prediction. As the demands of multi-scale traffic analysis increase, on-demand interactions and visualizations are expected to be available for transportation participants. We have designed a multi-scale traffic generation system, namely TrafficGPT, using three AI agents to process multi-scale traffic data, conduct multi-scale traffic analysis, and present multi-scale visualization results. TrafficGPT consists of three essential AI agents: 1) a text-to-demand agent that is employed with Question & Answer AI to interact with users and extract prediction tasks through texts; 2) a traffic prediction agent that leverages multi-scale traffic data to generate temporal features and similarity, and fuse them with limited spatial features and similarity, to achieve accurate prediction of three tasks; and 3) a suggestion and visualization agent that uses the prediction results to generate suggestions and visualizations, providing users with a comprehensive understanding of traffic conditions. Our TrafficGPT system focuses on addressing concerns about traffic prediction from transportation participants, and conducted extensive experiments on five real-world road datasets to demonstrate its superior predictive and interactive performance</p></details> |  |

The rapid development of IoT devices allows us to collect different kinds of data with high correlations to traffic predictions, fostering the development of efficient multi-modal traffic prediction models. Until now, there are few studies focusing on utilizing advantages of multi-modal data for traffic predictions. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal attentive cross-modality transformer model for long-term traffic predictions, namely xMTrans, with capability of exploring the temporal correlations between the data of two modalities: one target modality (for prediction, e.g., traffic congestion) and one support modality (e.g., people flow). We conducted extensive experiments to evaluate our proposed model on traffic congestion and taxi demand predictions using real-world datasets. The results showed the superiority of xMTrans against recent state-of-the-art methods on long-term traffic predictions. In addition, we also conducted a comprehensive ablation study to further analyze the effectiveness of each module in xMTrans.</p></details> | Accepted at MDM 2024 |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |
| **[Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network for Remaining Useful Life Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04336v1)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting Remaining Useful Life (RUL) plays a crucial role in the prognostics and health management of industrial systems that involve a variety of interrelated sensors. Given a constant stream of time series sensory data from such systems, deep learning models have risen to prominence at identifying complex, nonlinear temporal dependencies in these data. In addition to the temporal dependencies of individual sensors, spatial dependencies emerge as important correlations among these sensors, which can be naturally modelled by a temporal graph that describes time-varying spatial relationships. However, the majority of existing studies have relied on capturing discrete snapshots of this temporal graph, a coarse-grained approach that leads to loss of temporal information. Moreover, given the variety of heterogeneous sensors, it becomes vital that such inherent heterogeneity is leveraged for RUL prediction in temporal sensor graphs. To capture the nuances of the temporal and spatial relationships and heterogeneous characteristics in an interconnected graph of sensors, we introduce a novel model named Temporal and Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (THGNN). Specifically, THGNN aggregates historical data from neighboring nodes to accurately capture the temporal dynamics and spatial correlations within the stream of sensor data in a fine-grained manner. Moreover, the model leverages Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) to address the diversity of sensor types, significantly improving the model's capacity to learn the heterogeneity in the data sources. Finally, we have validated the effectiveness of our approach through comprehensive experiments. Our empirical findings demonstrate significant advancements on the N-CMAPSS dataset, achieving improvements of up to 19.2% and 31.6% in terms of two different evaluation metrics over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 12 pages |

This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

In this work, we focus on generating long-horizon trajectories that adhere to novel static and temporally-extended constraints/instructions at test time. We propose a data-driven diffusion-based framework, LTLDoG, that modifies the inference steps of the reverse process given an instruction specified using finite linear temporal logic ($\text{LTL}_f$). LTLDoG leverages a satisfaction value function on $\text{LTL}_f$ and guides the sampling steps using its gradient field. This value function can also be trained to generalize to new instructions not observed during training, enabling flexible test-time adaptability. Experiments in robot navigation and manipulation illustrate that the method is able to generate trajectories that satisfy formulae that specify obstacle avoidance and visitation sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Joint Estimation of Temporal Vertex and Edge Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06533v2)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adaptive estimation of coexisting temporal vertex (node) and edge signals on graphs is a critical task when a change in edge signals influences the temporal dynamics of the vertex signals. However, the current Graph Signal Processing algorithms mostly consider only the signals existing on the graph vertices and have neglected the fact that signals can reside on the edges. We propose an Adaptive Joint Vertex-Edge Estimation (AJVEE) algorithm for jointly estimating time-varying vertex and edge signals through a time-varying regression, incorporating both vertex signal filtering and edge signal filtering. Accompanying AJVEE is a newly proposed Adaptive Least Mean Square procedure based on the Hodge Laplacian (ALMS-Hodge), which is inspired by classical adaptive filters combining simplicial filtering and simplicial regression. AJVEE is able to operate jointly on the vertices and edges by merging two ALMS-Hodge algorithms specified on the vertices and edges into a unified formulation. A more generalized case extending AJVEE beyond the vertices and edges is being discussed. Experimenting on real-world traffic networks and population mobility networks, we have confirmed that our proposed AJVEE algorithm could accurately and jointly track time-varying vertex and edge signals on graphs.</p></details> |  |

However, this emerging risk has not been adequately addressed due to the absence of a benchmark dataset for AI-generated videos. In this paper, we first construct a video dataset using advanced diffusion-based video generation algorithms with various semantic contents. Besides, typical video lossy operations over network transmission are adopted to generate degraded samples. Then, by analyzing local and global temporal defects of current AI-generated videos, a novel detection framework by adaptively learning local motion information and global appearance variation is constructed to expose fake videos. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the generalization and robustness of different spatial and temporal domain detection methods, where the results can serve as the baseline and demonstrate the research challenge for future studies.</p></details> |  |

New proof techniques are developed and an improved new $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ sample complexity is derived. To our best knowledge, this is the first finite-time analysis of neural TD that achieves an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1})$ complexity under the Markovian sampling, as opposed to the best known $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ complexity in the existing literature.</p></details> |  |

An effective representation of a patient's EHR should hierarchically encompass both the temporal relationships between historical visits and medical events, and the inherent structural information within these elements. Existing patient representation methods can be roughly categorized into sequential representation and graphical representation. The sequential representation methods focus only on the temporal relationships among longitudinal visits. On the other hand, the graphical representation approaches, while adept at extracting the graph-structured relationships between various medical events, fall short in effectively integrate temporal information. To capture both types of information, we model a patient's EHR as a novel temporal heterogeneous graph. This graph includes historical visits nodes and medical events nodes. It propagates structured information from medical event nodes to visit nodes and utilizes time-aware visit nodes to capture changes in the patient's health status. Furthermore, we introduce a novel temporal graph transformer (TRANS) that integrates temporal edge features, global positional encoding, and local structural encoding into heterogeneous graph convolution, capturing both temporal and structural information. We validate the effectiveness of TRANS through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The results show that our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>IJCAI...</summary><p>IJCAI 2024 main track</p></details> |

Existing methods usually focus on leveraging spatial and temporal inconsistencies. However, these methods typically employ fixed operations to combine spatial and temporal clues, limiting their applicability in different scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Multilateral Temporal-view Pyramid Transformer ({\em MumPy}) that collaborates spatial-temporal clues flexibly. Our method utilizes a newly designed multilateral temporal-view encoder to extract various collaborations of spatial-temporal clues and introduces a deformable window-based temporal-view interaction module to enhance the diversity of these collaborations. Subsequently, we develop a multi-pyramid decoder to aggregate the various types of features and generate detection maps. By adjusting the contribution strength of spatial and temporal clues, our method can effectively identify inpainted regions. We validate our method on existing datasets and also introduce a new challenging and large-scale Video Inpainting dataset based on the YouTube-VOS dataset, which employs several more recent inpainting methods. The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain evaluation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Despite significant strides in ST modeling in recent years, there remains a need to emphasize harnessing the potential of information from different modalities. Robust MoST forecasting is more challenging because it possesses (i) high-dimensional and complex internal structures and (ii) dynamic heterogeneity caused by temporal, spatial, and modality variations. In this study, we propose a novel MoST learning framework via Self-Supervised Learning, namely MoSSL, which aims to uncover latent patterns from temporal, spatial, and modality perspectives while quantifying dynamic heterogeneity. Experiment results on two real-world MoST datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Inductive Logic Reasoning over Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05051v2)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive logic reasoning is a fundamental task in graph analysis, which aims to generalize patterns from data. This task has been extensively studied for traditional graph representations, such as knowledge graphs (KGs), using techniques like inductive logic programming (ILP). Existing ILP methods assume learning from KGs with static facts and binary relations. Beyond KGs, graph structures are widely present in other applications such as procedural instructions, scene graphs, and program executions. While ILP is beneficial for these applications, applying it to those graphs is nontrivial: they are more complex than KGs, which usually involve timestamps and n-ary relations, effectively a type of hypergraph with temporal events. In this work, we propose temporal inductive logic reasoning (TILR), an ILP method that reasons on temporal hypergraphs. To enable hypergraph reasoning, we introduce the multi-start random B-walk, a novel graph traversal method for hypergraphs. By combining it with a path-consistency algorithm, TILR learns logic rules by generalizing from both temporal and relational data. To address the lack of hypergraph benchmarks, we create and release two temporal hypergraph datasets: YouCook2-HG and nuScenes-HG. Experiments on these benchmarks demonstrate that TILR achieves superior reasoning capability over various strong baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic tube-based control synthesis of stochastic multi-agent systems under signal temporal logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02827v1)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the control design of stochastic discrete-time linear multi-agent systems (MASs) under a global signal temporal logic (STL) specification to be satisfied at a predefined probability. By decomposing the dynamics into deterministic and error components, we construct a probabilistic reachable tube (PRT) as the Cartesian product of reachable sets of the individual error systems driven by disturbances lying in confidence regions (CRs) with a fixed probability. By bounding the PRT probability with the specification probability, we tighten all state constraints induced by the STL specification by solving tractable optimization problems over segments of the PRT, and convert the underlying stochastic problem into a deterministic one. This approach reduces conservatism compared to tightening guided by the STL structure. Additionally, we propose a recursively feasible algorithm to attack the resulting problem by decomposing it into agent-level subproblems, which are solved iteratively according to a scheduling policy. We demonstrate our method on a ten-agent system, where existing approaches are impractical.</p></details> | Submitted to CDC24 |

Yet, few guidelines exist for making ultrasound Tactons easy to distinguish for users. In this paper, we investigated the distinguishability of temporal parameters of ultrasound Tactons in five studies (n=72 participants). Study 1 established the discrimination thresholds for amplitude-modulated (AM) frequencies. In Studies 2-5, we investigated distinguishable ultrasound Tactons by creating four Tacton sets based on mechanical vibrations in the literature and collected similarity ratings for the ultrasound Tactons. We identified a subset of temporal parameters, such as rhythm and low envelope frequency, that could create distinguishable ultrasound Tactons. Also, a strong correlation (mean Spearman's $\rho$=0.75) existed between similarity ratings for ultrasound Tactons and similarities of mechanical Tactons from the literature, suggesting vibrotactile designers can transfer their knowledge to ultrasound design. We present design guidelines and future directions for creating distinguishable mid-air ultrasound Tactons.</p></details> |  |

| **[Improve Temporal Awareness of LLMs for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02778v1)** | 2024-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive zero-shot abilities in solving a wide range of general-purpose tasks. However, it is empirically found that LLMs fall short in recognizing and utilizing temporal information, rendering poor performance in tasks that require an understanding of sequential data, such as sequential recommendation. In this paper, we aim to improve temporal awareness of LLMs by designing a principled prompting framework inspired by human cognitive processes. Specifically, we propose three prompting strategies to exploit temporal information within historical interactions for LLM-based sequential recommendation. Besides, we emulate divergent thinking by aggregating LLM ranking results derived from these strategies. Evaluations on MovieLens-1M and Amazon Review datasets indicate that our proposed method significantly enhances the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in sequential recommendation tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

As one of the important application domains of foundation models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture, earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation models. Specifically, for transfer learning of the land cover downstream task on the PhilEO Bench dataset, it shows 10.4\% higher accuracy compared with other geospatial foundation models on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hysteresis Compensation of Flexible Continuum Manipulator using RGBD Sensing and Temporal Convolutional Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11319v3)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexible continuum manipulators are valued for minimally invasive surgery, offering access to confined spaces through nonlinear paths. However, cable-driven manipulators face control difficulties due to hysteresis from cabling effects such as friction, elongation, and coupling. These effects are difficult to model due to nonlinearity and the difficulties become even more evident when dealing with long and coupled, multi-segmented manipulator. This paper proposes a data-driven approach based on Deep Neural Networks (DNN) to capture these nonlinear and previous states-dependent characteristics of cable actuation. We collect physical joint configurations according to command joint configurations using RGBD sensing and 7 fiducial markers to model the hysteresis of the proposed manipulator. Result on a study comparing the estimation performance of four DNN models show that the Temporal Convolution Network (TCN) demonstrates the highest predictive capability. Leveraging trained TCNs, we build a control algorithm to compensate for hysteresis. Tracking tests in task space using unseen trajectories show that the proposed control algorithm reduces the average position and orientation error by 61.39% (from 13.7mm to 5.29 mm) and 64.04% (from 31.17{\deg} to 11.21{\deg}), respectively. This result implies that the proposed calibrated controller effectively reaches the desired configurations by estimating the hysteresis of the manipulator. Applying this method in real surgical scenarios has the potential to enhance control precision and improve surgical performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

To address this task, this paper presents a novel trajectory prediction model tailored for accuracy in the face of heterogeneous and uncertain traffic scenarios. At the heart of this model lies the Characterized Diffusion Module, an innovative module designed to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty. This module enriches the predictive process by infusing it with detailed semantic information, thereby enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy. Complementing this, our Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module captures the nuanced effects of traffic scenarios on vehicle dynamics across both spatial and temporal dimensions with remarkable effectiveness. Demonstrated through exhaustive evaluations, our model sets a new standard in trajectory prediction, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) datasets across both short and extended temporal spans. This performance underscores the model's unparalleled adaptability and efficacy in navigating complex traffic scenarios, including highways, urban streets, and intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

We formalise this problem as the Temporal Reachability Dominating Set (TaRDiS}) problem on temporal graphs. We provide positive and negative parameterized complexity results in four different parameters: the number $k$ of initially infected, the lifetime $\tau$ of the graph, the number of locally earliest edges in the graph, and the treewidth of the footprint graph $\mathcal{G}_\downarrow$. We additionally introduce and study the MaxMinTaRDiS problem, where the aim is to schedule connections between individuals so that at least $k$ individuals must be infected for the entire population to become fully infected. We classify three variants of the problem: Strict, Nonstrict, and Happy. We show these to be coNP-complete, NP-hard, and $\Sigma_2^P$-complete, respectively. Interestingly, we obtain hardness of the Nonstrict variant by showing that a natural restriction is exactly the well-studied Distance-3 Independent Set problem on static graphs.</p></details> | 38 pages, 17 figures |

While this representation reflects their relative order, it abstracts away the specific times associated with each state. However, timing constraints are important in many applications like, for instance, when planning and scheduling go hand in hand. We address this by developing a metric extension of linear-time temporal equilibrium logic, in which temporal operators are constrained by intervals over natural numbers. The resulting Metric Equilibrium Logic provides the foundation of an ASP-based approach for specifying qualitative and quantitative dynamic constraints. To this end, we define a translation of metric formulas into monadic first-order formulas and give a correspondence between their models in Metric Equilibrium Logic and Monadic Quantified Equilibrium Logic, respectively. Interestingly, our translation provides a blue print for implementation in terms of ASP modulo difference constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)</p></details> |

While temporal aspects of language have been considered in computational linguistics, there has been no research on temporal references in emergent communication. This paper addresses this gap, by exploring how agents communicate about temporal relationships. We analyse three potential influences for the emergence of temporal references: environmental, external, and architectural changes. Our experiments demonstrate that altering the loss function is insufficient for temporal references to emerge; rather, architectural changes are necessary. However, a minimal change in agent architecture, using a different batching method, allows the emergence of temporal references. This modified design is compared with the standard architecture in a temporal referential games environment, which emphasises temporal relationships. The analysis indicates that over 95\% of the agents with the modified batching method develop temporal references, without changes to their loss function. We consider temporal referencing necessary for future improvements to the agents' communication efficiency, yielding a closer to optimal coding as compared to purely compositional languages. Our readily transferable architectural insights provide the basis for their incorporation into other emergent communication settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages main body and 36 pages supplementary material, 8 figures in main body.

Firstly, STGCN is tailored to parameterize UC. Then, few-shot physics-guided learning scheme is proposed. It exploits few typical UC solutions yielded via commercial optimizer to escape from local minimum, and leverages the augmented Lagrangian method for constraint satisfaction. To further enable both feasibility and continuous relaxation for integers in learning process, straight-through estimator for Tanh-Sign composition is proposed to fully differentiate the mixed integer solution space. Case study on the IEEE benchmark justifies that, our method bests mainstream learning ways on UC feasibility, and surpasses traditional solver on efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |

Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) and their equivalent ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to establish a smooth connection between a complex data distribution and a tractable prior distribution. In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |

Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context.

This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

This article presents a trajectory planning and tracking framework designed for HyFCQs. In this framework, a terrestrial-aerial path-searching method with the crawling limitation of HyFCQs is proposed to guarantee the dynamical feasibility of trajectories. Additionally, a trajectory tracking method is proposed to address the challenges associated with the deformation time required by HyFCQs, which makes tracking hybrid trajectories at the junction between terrestrial and aerial segments difficult. Simulations and real-world experiments in diverse scenarios validate the exceptional performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times. A video of the proposed method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDbaeLfcN4.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Distributional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08367v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous efforts have been put forth on predicting pedestrian trajectory with generative models to accommodate uncertainty and multi-modality in human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15881v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |

Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

Our approach models all driving scenario elements in a unified model: the position of new agents, their initial state, and their future motion trajectories. By predicting the distributions of all these variables from a shared global scenario embedding, we ensure that the final generated scenario is fully conditioned on all available context in the existing scene. Our unified modeling approach, combined with autoregressive agent injection, conditions the placement and motion trajectory of every new agent on all existing agents and their trajectories, leading to realistic scenarios with low collision rates. Our experimental results show that UniGen outperforms prior state of the art on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2024</p></details> |
| **[Jointly Learning Cost and Constraints from Demonstrations for Safe Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03491v1)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from Demonstration allows robots to mimic human actions. However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unscented Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02753v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis reduces sample size requirements and expedites time-to-efficacy signals in advanced cancer clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02529v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis is limited to single unidirectional endpoints, most advanced cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are powered for either progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, this paper presents a novel trajectory prediction model tailored for accuracy in the face of heterogeneous and uncertain traffic scenarios. At the heart of this model lies the Characterized Diffusion Module, an innovative module designed to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty. This module enriches the predictive process by infusing it with detailed semantic information, thereby enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy. Complementing this, our Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module captures the nuanced effects of traffic scenarios on vehicle dynamics across both spatial and temporal dimensions with remarkable effectiveness. Demonstrated through exhaustive evaluations, our model sets a new standard in trajectory prediction, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) datasets across both short and extended temporal spans. This performance underscores the model's unparalleled adaptability and efficacy in navigating complex traffic scenarios, including highways, urban streets, and intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

Importantly, it maintains competitive performance even in scenarios with substantial missing data, on par with most existing state-of-the-art models.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Non-autoregressive Multi-Horizon Flight Trajectory Prediction Framework with Gray Code Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01658v3)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight Trajectory Prediction (FTP) is an essential task in Air Traffic Control (ATC), which can assist air traffic controllers in managing airspace more safely and efficiently. Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on sparse trajectories with three different sampling intervals that are respectively constructed from two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a regular paper at IEEE TKDE</p></details> |

This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Adaptive Informative Path Planning with Multimodal Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18374v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of an autonomous agent equipped with multiple sensors, each with different sensing precision and energy costs. The agent's goal is to explore the environment and gather information subject to its resource constraints in unknown, partially observable environments. The challenge lies in reasoning about the effects of sensing and movement while respecting the agent's resource and dynamic constraints. We formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem and solve it using a projection-based trajectory optimization approach where the objective is to reduce the variance of the Gaussian process world belief. Our approach outperforms previous approaches in long horizon trajectories by achieving an overall variance reduction of up to 85% and reducing the root-mean square error in the environment belief by 50%. This approach was developed in support of rover path planning for the NASA VIPER Mission.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies</p></details> |
| **[Compressed Deepfake Video Detection Based on 3D Spatiotemporal Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18149v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The misuse of deepfake technology by malicious actors poses a potential threat to nations, societies, and individuals. However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as contrastive learning and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that our method improves performance on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative model that infuses cognitive insights into trajectory prediction, focusing on perceived safety and dynamic decision-making. Distinct from traditional approaches, our model excels in analyzing interactions and behavior patterns in mixed autonomy traffic scenarios. It represents a significant leap forward, achieving marked performance improvements on several key datasets. Specifically, it surpasses existing benchmarks with gains of 16.2% on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), 27.4% on the Highway Drone (HighD), and 19.8% on the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) dataset. Our proposed model shows exceptional proficiency in handling corner cases, essential for real-world applications. Moreover, its robustness is evident in scenarios with missing or limited data, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art baselines. This adaptability and resilience position our model as a viable tool for real-world autonomous driving systems, heralding a new standard in vehicle trajectory prediction for enhanced safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset. The proposed method demonstrates slight advantages in clustering and strong advantages in runtime, especially for long trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2023 IEEE-RAS 22nd International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids).

Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |

This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2024, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods.

Dynamic obstacles may also be interactive, i.e., their behavior varies based on the behavior of other entities. We propose a novel representation for interactive behavior of dynamic obstacles and a decentralized real-time multi-robot trajectory planning algorithm allowing inter-robot collision avoidance as well as static and dynamic obstacle avoidance. Our planner simulates the behavior of dynamic obstacles, accounting for interactivity. We account for the perception inaccuracy of static and prediction inaccuracy of dynamic obstacles. We handle asynchronous planning between teammates and message delays, drops, and re-orderings. We evaluate our algorithm in simulations using 25400 random cases and compare it against three state-of-the-art baselines using 2100 random cases. Our algorithm achieves up to 1.68x success rate using as low as 0.28x time in single-robot, and up to 2.15x success rate using as low as 0.36x time in multi-robot cases compared to the best baseline. We implement our planner on real quadrotors to show its real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2302.12873</p></details> |
| **[Is Mamba Compatible with Trajectory Optimization in Offline Reinforcement Learning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12094v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based trajectory optimization methods have demonstrated exceptional performance in offline Reinforcement Learning (offline RL), yet it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba in offline RL (dubbed DeMa) from the aspect of data structures and network architectures with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements due to the fact that DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify that the hidden attention mechanism is key to its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations from eight Atari games demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods, outdoing Decision Transformer (DT) by 80\% with 30\% fewer parameters, and exceeds DT in MuJoCo with only a quarter of the parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We propose methods for clustering trajectory-states and sampling strategies in an active learning framework, aiming to reduce annotation and data costs while maintaining model performance. Our approach leverages trajectory information to guide data selection, promoting diversity in the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on the trajectory prediction task using the nuScenes dataset, showing consistent performance gains over random sampling across different data pool sizes, and even reaching sub-baseline displacement errors at just 50% of the data cost. Our results suggest that sampling typical data initially helps overcome the ''cold start problem,'' while introducing novelty becomes more beneficial as the training pool size increases. By integrating trajectory-state-informed active learning, we demonstrate that more efficient and robust autonomous driving systems are possible and practical using low-cost data curation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory-Based Individualized Treatment Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09810v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A core component of precision medicine research involves optimizing individualized treatment rules (ITRs) based on patient characteristics. Many studies used to estimate ITRs are longitudinal in nature, collecting outcomes over time. Yet, to date, methods developed to estimate ITRs often ignore the longitudinal structure of the data. Information available from the longitudinal nature of the data can be especially useful in mental health studies. Although treatment means might appear similar, understanding the trajectory of outcomes over time can reveal important differences between treatments and placebo effects. This longitudinal perspective is especially beneficial in mental health research, where subtle shifts in outcome patterns can hold significant implications. Despite numerous studies involving the collection of outcome data across various time points, most precision medicine methods used to develop ITRs overlook the information available from the longitudinal structure. The prevalence of missing data in such studies exacerbates the issue, as neglecting the longitudinal nature of the data can significantly impair the effectiveness of treatment rules. This paper develops a powerful longitudinal trajectory-based ITR construction method that incorporates baseline variables, via a single-index or biosignature, into the modeling of longitudinal outcomes. This trajectory-based ITR approach substantially minimizes the negative impact of missing data compared to more traditional ITR approaches. The approach is illustrated through simulation studies and a clinical trial for depression, contrasting it with more traditional ITRs that ignore longitudinal information.</p></details> |  |

Score-based Diffusion Models, a type of generative model that iteratively learns to denoise data, have shown state-of-the-art results on tasks such as image generation, multivariate time series forecasting, and robotic trajectory planning. Using score-based diffusion models, this work implements a novel generative framework to generate ballistic transfers from Earth to Mars. We further analyze the model's ability to learn the characteristics of the original dataset and its ability to produce transfers that follow the underlying dynamics. Ablation studies were conducted to determine how model performance varies with model size and trajectory temporal resolution. In addition, a performance benchmark is designed to assess the generative model's usefulness for trajectory design, conduct model performance comparisons, and lay the groundwork for evaluating different generative models for trajectory design beyond diffusion. The results of this analysis showcase several useful properties of diffusion models that, when taken together, can enable a future system for generative trajectory design powered by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the 2024 Astrodynamics Specialist Conference</p></details> |

The two main challenges addressed include accurately predicting the paths of UAVs and efficiently avoiding collisions between them. Firstly, the paper systematically applies a diverse set of activation functions to a Feedforward Neural Network (FFNN) with a single hidden layer, which enhances the accuracy of the predicted path compared to previous work. Secondly, we introduce a novel activation function, AdaptoSwelliGauss, which is a sophisticated fusion of Swish and Elliott activations, seamlessly integrated with a scaled and shifted Gaussian component. Swish facilitates smooth transitions, Elliott captures abrupt trajectory changes, and the scaled and shifted Gaussian enhances robustness against noise. This dynamic combination is specifically designed to excel in capturing the complexities of UAV trajectory prediction. This new activation function gives substantially better accuracy than all existing activation functions. Thirdly, we propose a novel Integrated Collision Detection, Avoidance, and Batching (ICDAB) strategy that merges two complementary UAV collision avoidance techniques: changing UAV trajectories and altering their starting times, also referred to as batching. This integration helps overcome the disadvantages of both - reduction in the number of trajectory manipulations, which avoids overly convoluted paths in the first technique, and smaller batch sizes, which reduce overall takeoff time in the second.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 Pa...</summary><p>24 Pages, 9 Tables, 6 Figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic Trajectory Data Mining with LLM-Informed POI Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11715v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human travel trajectory mining is crucial for transportation systems, enhancing route optimization, traffic management, and the study of human travel patterns. Previous rule-based approaches without the integration of semantic information show a limitation in both efficiency and accuracy. Semantic information, such as activity types inferred from Points of Interest (POI) data, can significantly enhance the quality of trajectory mining. However, integrating these insights is challenging, as many POIs have incomplete feature information, and current learning-based POI algorithms require the integrity of datasets to do the classification. In this paper, we introduce a novel pipeline for human travel trajectory mining. Our approach first leverages the strong inferential and comprehension capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to annotate POI with activity types and then uses a Bayesian-based algorithm to infer activity for each stay point in a trajectory. In our evaluation using the OpenStreetMap (OSM) POI dataset, our approach achieves a 93.4% accuracy and a 96.1% F-1 score in POI classification, and a 91.7% accuracy with a 92.3% F-1 score in activity inference.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to investigate how clusters of these functional relations evolve over time. Our model clusters individual functional trajectories within and across time periods while flexibly accommodating the evolution of the partitions across time periods with covariates. Motivated by mobile health data collected in a novel, smartphone-based smoking cessation intervention study, we demonstrate how our proposed method can simultaneously cluster functional trajectories, accommodate temporal dependence, and provide insights into the transitions between functional clusters over time.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we identify several intriguing trajectory properties in the ODE-based sampling process of diffusion models. We characterize an implicit denoising trajectory and discuss its vital role in forming the coupled sampling trajectory with a strong shape regularity, regardless of the generated content. We also describe a dynamic programming-based scheme to make the time schedule in sampling better fit the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to any given ODE-based numerical solvers and incurs negligible computational cost, while delivering superior performance in image generation, especially in $5\sim 10$ function evaluations.</p></details> | ICML 2024, 30 pages |
| **[Dreamer XL: Towards High-Resolution Text-to-3D Generation via Trajectory Score Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11252v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a novel Trajectory Score Matching (TSM) method that aims to solve the pseudo ground truth inconsistency problem caused by the accumulated error in Interval Score Matching (ISM) when using the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) inversion process. Unlike ISM which adopts the inversion process of DDIM to calculate on a single path, our TSM method leverages the inversion process of DDIM to generate two paths from the same starting point for calculation. Since both paths start from the same starting point, TSM can reduce the accumulated error compared to ISM, thus alleviating the problem of pseudo ground truth inconsistency. TSM enhances the stability and consistency of the model's generated paths during the distillation process. We demonstrate this experimentally and further show that ISM is a special case of TSM. Furthermore, to optimize the current multi-stage optimization process from high-resolution text to 3D generation, we adopt Stable Diffusion XL for guidance. In response to the issues of abnormal replication and splitting caused by unstable gradients during the 3D Gaussian splatting process when using Stable Diffusion XL, we propose a pixel-by-pixel gradient clipping method. Extensive experiments show that our model significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art models in terms of visual quality and performance.

| **[RuleFuser: Injecting Rules in Evidential Networks for Robust Out-of-Distribution Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11139v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern neural trajectory predictors in autonomous driving are developed using imitation learning (IL) from driving logs. Although IL benefits from its ability to glean nuanced and multi-modal human driving behaviors from large datasets, the resulting predictors often struggle with out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and with traffic rule compliance. On the other hand, classical rule-based predictors, by design, can predict traffic rule satisfying behaviors while being robust to OOD scenarios, but these predictors fail to capture nuances in agent-to-agent interactions and human driver's intent. In this paper, we present RuleFuser, a posterior-net inspired evidential framework that combines neural predictors with classical rule-based predictors to draw on the complementary benefits of both, thereby striking a balance between performance and traffic rule compliance. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated on the real-world nuPlan dataset where RuleFuser leverages the higher performance of the neural predictor in in-distribution (ID) scenarios and the higher safety offered by the rule-based predictor in OOD scenarios.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

This report investigates the potential of deploying a fully actuated Remotely Operated Vehicle (ROV) for shallow area exploration beneath ice sheets. Leveraging advancements in marine robotics technology, ROVs offer a promising solution for extending human presence into remote underwater locations. To enable successful under-ice exploration, the ROV must follow precise trajectories for effective localization signal reception. This study develops a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear system controller, incorporating a Lyapunov-based stability guarantee and an adaptation law to mitigate unknown environmental disturbances. Fuzzy logic is employed to dynamically adjust adaptation rates, enhancing performance in highly nonlinear ROV dynamic systems. Additionally, a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm automates the tuning of controller parameters for optimal trajectory tracking. The report details the ROV dynamic model, the proposed control framework, and the PSO-based tuning process. Simulation-based experiments validate the efficacy of the methodology, with experimental results demonstrating superior trajectory tracking performance compared to baseline controllers. This work contributes to the advancement of under-ice exploration capabilities and sets the stage for future research in marine robotics and autonomous underwater systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite this recent upsurge, this area is still rarely systematically studied. In this paper, we provide an extensive survey, investigating CRL methods based on both interactive reinforcement learning algorithms and human-AI collaborative frameworks that were proposed in the past decade. We elucidate and discuss via synergistic analysis methods both the growth of the field and the state-of-the-art; we conceptualise the existing frameworks from the perspectives of design patterns, collaborative levels, parties and capabilities, and review interactive methods and algorithmic models. Specifically, we create a new Human-AI CRL Design Trajectory Map, as a systematic modelling tool for the selection of existing CRL frameworks, as well as a method of designing new CRL systems, and finally of improving future CRL designs. Furthermore, we elaborate generic Human-AI CRL challenges, providing the research community with a guide towards novel research directions. The aim of this paper is to empower researchers with a systematic framework for the design of efficient and 'natural' human-AI collaborative methods, making it possible to work on maximised realisation of humans' and AI's potentials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Maritime Trajectory Forecasting via H3 Index and Causal Language Modelling (CLM)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09596v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prediction of ship trajectories is a growing field of study in artificial intelligence. Traditional methods rely on the use of LSTM, GRU networks, and even Transformer architectures for the prediction of spatio-temporal series. This study proposes a viable alternative for predicting these trajectories using only GNSS positions. It considers this spatio-temporal problem as a natural language processing problem. The latitude/longitude coordinates of AIS messages are transformed into cell identifiers using the H3 index. Thanks to the pseudo-octal representation, it becomes easier for language models to learn the spatial hierarchy of the H3 index. The method is compared with a classical Kalman filter, widely used in the maritime domain, and introduces the Fr\'echet distance as the main evaluation metric. We show that it is possible to predict ship trajectories quite precisely up to 8 hours with 30 minutes of context. We demonstrate that this alternative works well enough to predict trajectories worldwide.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Application of Gated Recurrent Units for CT Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09333v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computed tomography (CT) imaging, especially with dual-robot systems, have introduced new challenges for scan trajectory optimization. This paper presents a novel approach using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to optimize CT scan trajectories. Our approach exploits the flexibility of robotic CT systems to select projections that enhance image quality by improving resolution and contrast while reducing scan time. We focus on cone-beam CT and employ several projection-based metrics, including absorption, pixel intensities, contrast-to-noise ratio, and data completeness. The GRU network aims to minimize data redundancy and maximize completeness with a limited number of projections. We validate our method using simulated data of a test specimen, focusing on a specific voxel of interest. The results show that the GRU-optimized scan trajectories can outperform traditional circular CT trajectories in terms of image quality metrics. For the used specimen, SSIM improves from 0.38 to 0.49 and CNR increases from 6.97 to 9.08. This finding suggests that the application of GRU in CT scan trajectory optimization can lead to more efficient, cost-effective, and high-quality imaging solutions.</p></details> | 4 pages, 6 figures |

| **[SOMTP: Self-Supervised Learning-Based Optimizer for MPC-Based Safe Trajectory Planning Problems in Robotics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09212v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Predictive Control (MPC)-based trajectory planning has been widely used in robotics, and incorporating Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints into MPC can greatly improve its obstacle avoidance efficiency. Unfortunately, traditional optimizers are resource-consuming and slow to solve such non-convex constrained optimization problems (COPs) while learning-based methods struggle to satisfy the non-convex constraints. In this paper, we propose SOMTP algorithm, a self-supervised learning-based optimizer for CBF-MPC trajectory planning. Specifically, first, SOMTP employs problem transcription to satisfy most of the constraints. Then the differentiable SLPG correction is proposed to move the solution closer to the safe set and is then converted as the guide policy in the following training process. After that, inspired by the Augmented Lagrangian Method (ALM), our training algorithm integrated with guide policy constraints is proposed to enable the optimizer network to converge to a feasible solution. Finally, experiments show that the proposed algorithm has better feasibility than other learning-based methods and can provide solutions much faster than traditional optimizers with similar optimality.</p></details> |  |

Prompted by the need for dependable uncertainty estimates in motion planning applications where the behavior of diverse objects may be more or less unpredictable, we blend different techniques from online conformal prediction of single and multiple time series, as well as ideas for addressing heteroscedasticity in regression. This solution is both principled, providing precise finite-sample guarantees, and effective, often leading to more informative predictions than prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dim Small Target Detection and Tracking: A Novel Method Based on Temporal Energy Selective Scaling and Trajectory Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09054v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The detection and tracking of small targets in passive optical remote sensing (PORS) has broad applications. However, most of the previously proposed methods seldom utilize the abundant temporal features formed by target motion, resulting in poor detection and tracking performance for low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) targets. In this article, we analyze the difficulty based on spatial features and the feasibility based on temporal features of realizing effective detection. According to this analysis, we use a multi-frame as a detection unit and propose a detection method based on temporal energy selective scaling (TESS). Specifically, we investigated the composition of intensity temporal profiles (ITPs) formed by pixels on a multi-frame detection unit. For the target-present pixel, the target passing through the pixel will bring a weak transient disturbance on the ITP and introduce a change in the statistical properties of ITP. We use a well-designed function to amplify the transient disturbance, suppress the background and noise components, and output the trajectory of the target on the multi-frame detection unit. Subsequently, to solve the contradiction between the detection rate and the false alarm rate brought by the traditional threshold segmentation, we associate the temporal and spatial features of the output trajectory and propose a trajectory extraction method based on the 3D Hough transform. Finally, we model the trajectory of the target and propose a trajectory-based multi-target tracking method. Compared with the various state-of-the-art detection and tracking methods, experiments in multiple scenarios prove the superiority of our proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

To address this constraint, we propose a derivative-based lifting function construction method, show that the corresponding infinite dimensional Koopman bilinear model over the lifting function is equivalent to the original control-affine system. Further, we analyze the propagation and bounds of state prediction errors caused by the truncation in derivative order. The identified finite dimensional Koopman bilinear model would serve as predictive model in the next step. Koopman Bilinear Model Predictive control (K-BMPC) is proposed to solve the trajectory tracking problem. We linearize the bilinear model around the estimation of the lifted state and control input. Then the bilinear Model Predictive Control problem is approximated by a quadratic programming problem. Further, the estimation is updated at each iteration until the convergence is reached. Moreover, we implement our algorithm on a tractor-trailer system, taking into account the longitudinal and side slip effects. The open-loop simulation shows the proposed Koopman bilinear model captures the dynamics with unknown parameters and has good prediction performance. Closed-loop tracking results show the proposed K-BMPC exhibits elevated tracking precision with the commendable computational efficiency. The experimental results demonstrate the feasibility of K-BMPC.</p></details> |  |

This article presents a trajectory planning and tracking framework designed for HyFCQs. In this framework, a terrestrial-aerial path-searching method with the crawling limitation of HyFCQs is proposed to guarantee the dynamical feasibility of trajectories. Additionally, a trajectory tracking method is proposed to address the challenges associated with the deformation time required by HyFCQs, which makes tracking hybrid trajectories at the junction between terrestrial and aerial segments difficult. Simulations and real-world experiments in diverse scenarios validate the exceptional performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReeSPOT: Reeb Graph Models Semantic Patterns of Normalcy in Human Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00808v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ReeSPOT, a novel Reeb graph-based method to model patterns of life in human trajectories (akin to a fingerprint). Human behavior typically follows a pattern of normalcy in day-to-day activities. This is marked by recurring activities within specific time periods. In this paper, we model this behavior using Reeb graphs where any deviation from usual day-to-day activities is encoded as nodes in the Reeb graph. The complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear with respect to the number of time points in a given trajectory. We demonstrate the usage of ReeSPOT and how it captures the critically significant spatial and temporal deviations using the nodes of the Reeb graph. Our case study presented in this paper includes realistic human movement scenarios: visiting uncommon locations, taking odd routes at infrequent times, uncommon time visits, and uncommon stay durations. We analyze the Reeb graph to interpret the topological structure of the GPS trajectories. Potential applications of ReeSPOT include urban planning, security surveillance, and behavioral research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Plan Maneuverable and Agile Flight Trajectory with Optimization Embedded Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07736v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent times, an increasing number of researchers have been devoted to utilizing deep neural networks for end-to-end flight navigation. This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/ZJU-FAST-Lab/e2e_opt</p></details> |
| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Vehicle Using Iterative Reward Prediction in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12079v4)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional trajectory planning methods for autonomous vehicles have several limitations. For example, heuristic and explicit simple rules limit generalizability and hinder complex motions. These limitations can be addressed using reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning. However, reinforcement learning suffers from unstable learning, and existing reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning methods do not consider the uncertainties. Thus, this paper, proposes a reinforcement learning-based trajectory planning method for autonomous vehicles. The proposed method involves an iterative reward prediction approach that iteratively predicts expectations of future states. These predicted states are then used to forecast rewards and integrated into the learning process to enhance stability. Additionally, a method is proposed that utilizes uncertainty propagation to make the reinforcement learning agent aware of uncertainties. The proposed method was evaluated using the CARLA simulator. Compared to the baseline methods, the proposed method reduced the collision rate by 60.17 %, and increased the average reward by 30.82 times. A video of the proposed method is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfDbaeLfcN4.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Modeling Pedestrian Intrinsic Uncertainty for Multimodal Stochastic Trajectory Prediction via Energy Plan Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07164v1)** | 2024-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in the realms of autonomous driving and smart cities. Despite extensive prior research employing sequence and generative models, the unpredictable nature of pedestrians, influenced by their social interactions and individual preferences, presents challenges marked by uncertainty and multimodality. In response, we propose the Energy Plan Denoising (EPD) model for stochastic trajectory prediction. EPD initially provides a coarse estimation of the distribution of future trajectories, termed the Plan, utilizing the Langevin Energy Model. Subsequently, it refines this estimation through denoising via the Probabilistic Diffusion Model. By initiating denoising with the Plan, EPD effectively reduces the need for iterative steps, thereby enhancing efficiency. Furthermore, EPD differs from conventional approaches by modeling the distribution of trajectories instead of individual trajectories. This allows for the explicit modeling of pedestrian intrinsic uncertainties and eliminates the need for multiple denoising operations. A single denoising operation produces a distribution from which multiple samples can be drawn, significantly enhancing efficiency. Moreover, EPD's fine-tuning of the Plan contributes to improved model performance. We validate EPD on two publicly available datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art results. Additionally, ablation experiments underscore the contributions of individual modules, affirming the efficacy of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction via Distributional Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08367v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tremendous efforts have been put forth on predicting pedestrian trajectory with generative models to accommodate uncertainty and multi-modality in human behaviors. An individual's inherent uncertainty, e.g., change of destination, can be masked by complex patterns resulting from the movements of interacting pedestrians. However, latent variable-based generative models often entangle such uncertainty with complexity, leading to limited either latent expressivity or predictive diversity. In this work, we propose to separately model these two factors by implicitly deriving a flexible latent representation to capture intricate pedestrian movements, while integrating predictive uncertainty of individuals with explicit bivariate Gaussian mixture densities over their future locations. More specifically, we present a model-agnostic uncertainty-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction framework, parameterizing sufficient statistics for the mixture of Gaussians that jointly comprise the multi-modal trajectories. We further estimate these parameters of interest by approximating a denoising process that progressively recovers pedestrian movements from noise. Unlike previous studies, we translate the predictive stochasticity to explicit distributions, allowing it to readily generate plausible future trajectories indicating individuals' self-uncertainty. Moreover, our framework is compatible with different neural net architectures. We empirically show the performance gains over state-of-the-art even with lighter backbones, across most scenes on two public benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for Stochastic Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15881v2)** | 2024-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is fundamental to various intelligent technologies, such as autonomous driving and robotics. The motion prediction of pedestrians and vehicles helps emergency braking, reduces collisions, and improves traffic safety. Current trajectory prediction research faces problems of complex social interactions, high dynamics and multi-modality. Especially, it still has limitations in long-time prediction. We propose Attention-aware Social Graph Transformer Networks for multi-modal trajectory prediction. We combine Graph Convolutional Networks and Transformer Networks by generating stable resolution pseudo-images from Spatio-temporal graphs through a designed stacking and interception method. Furthermore, we design the attention-aware module to handle social interaction information in scenarios involving mixed pedestrian-vehicle traffic. Thus, we maintain the advantages of the Graph and Transformer, i.e., the ability to aggregate information over an arbitrary number of neighbors and the ability to perform complex time-dependent data processing. We conduct experiments on datasets involving pedestrian, vehicle, and mixed trajectories, respectively. Our results demonstrate that our model minimizes displacement errors across various metrics and significantly reduces the likelihood of collisions. It is worth noting that our model effectively reduces the final displacement error, illustrating the ability of our model to predict for a long time.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Network analysis using Krylov subspace trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01269v2)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.</p></details> |  |

Traffickers exploit the victims through forced labor, involuntary sex, or organ harvesting. Migrant smuggling could also be seen as a form of human trafficking when the migrant fails to pay the smuggler and is forced into coerced activities. Several news agencies and anti-trafficking organizations have reported trafficking survivor stories that include the names of locations visited along the trafficking route. Identifying such routes can provide knowledge that is essential to preventing such heinous crimes. In this paper we propose a Narrative to Trajectory (N2T) information extraction system that analyzes reported narratives, extracts relevant information through the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, and applies geospatial augmentation in order to automatically plot trajectories of human trafficking routes. We evaluate N2T on human trafficking text corpora and demonstrate that our approach of utilizing data preprocessing and augmenting database techniques with NLP libraries outperforms existing geolocation detection methods.</p></details> |  |

As international laws are not fully set to deal with the migration crisis, people are relying on networks of exploiting smugglers to escape the devastation in order to live in stability. During the smuggling journey, migrants can become victims of human trafficking if they fail to pay the smuggler and may be forced into coerced labor. Government agencies and anti-trafficking organizations try to identify the trafficking routes based on stories of survivors in order to gain knowledge and help prevent such crimes. In this paper, we propose a system called Narrative to Trajectory (N2T+), which extracts trajectories of trafficking routes. N2T+ uses Data Science and Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze trafficking narratives, automatically extract relevant location names, disambiguate possible name ambiguities, and plot the trafficking route on a map. In a comparative evaluation we show that the proposed multi-dimensional approach offers significantly higher geolocation detection than other state of the art techniques.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Though existing notable efforts have resulted in impressive performance improvements, a gap persists in scene cognitive and understanding of the complex traffic semantics. This paper proposes Traj-LLM, the first to investigate the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) without explicit prompt engineering to generate future motion from agents' past/observed trajectories and scene semantics. Traj-LLM starts with sparse context joint coding to dissect the agent and scene features into a form that LLMs understand. On this basis, we innovatively explore LLMs' powerful comprehension abilities to capture a spectrum of high-level scene knowledge and interactive information. Emulating the human-like lane focus cognitive function and enhancing Traj-LLM's scene comprehension, we introduce lane-aware probabilistic learning powered by the pioneering Mamba module. Finally, a multi-modal Laplace decoder is designed to achieve scene-compliant multi-modal predictions. Extensive experiments manifest that Traj-LLM, fortified by LLMs' strong prior knowledge and understanding prowess, together with lane-aware probability learning, outstrips state-of-the-art methods across evaluation metrics. Moreover, the few-shot analysis further substantiates Traj-LLM's performance, wherein with just 50% of the dataset, it outperforms the majority of benchmarks relying on complete data utilization. This study explores equipping the trajectory prediction task with advanced capabilities inherent in LLMs, furnishing a more universal and adaptable solution for forecasting agent motion in a new way.</p></details> |  |

To enhance similarity measurement across diverse contexts, invariant motion descriptors have been proposed. However, for rigid-body motion, few invariant descriptors exist that are bi-invariant, meaning invariant to both the body and world reference frames used to describe the motion. Moreover, their robustness to singularities is limited. This paper introduces a novel Bi-Invariant Local Trajectory-Shape descriptor (BILTS) and a corresponding dissimilarity measure. Mathematical relationships between BILTS and existing descriptors are derived, providing new insights into their properties. The paper also includes an algorithm to reproduce the motion from the BILTS descriptor, demonstrating its bidirectionality and usefulness for trajectory generation. Experimental validation using datasets of daily-life activities shows the higher robustness of the BILTS descriptor compared to the bi-invariant ISA descriptor. This higher robustness supports the further application of bi-invariant descriptors for motion recognition and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted as a regular research paper for consideration in the IEEE Transactions on Robotics.

There exists many algorithms where these parameters are estimated using least-squares in a first, pre-processing, step, including subspace identification and multi-step least-squares algorithms, such as Weighted Null-Space Fitting. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in non-asymptotic analysis of estimation algorithms. In this contribution we identify the Markov parameters using weighted least-squares and present non-asymptotic analysis for such estimator. To cover both stable and unstable systems, multiple trajectories are collected. We show that with the optimal weighting matrix, weighted least-squares gives a tighter error bound than ordinary least-squares for the case of non-uniformly distributed measurement errors. Moreover, as the optimal weighting matrix depends on the system's true parameters, we introduce two methods to consistently estimate the optimal weighting matrix, where the convergence rate of these estimates is also provided. Numerical experiments demonstrate improvements of weighted least-squares over ordinary least-squares in finite sample settings.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods overlook complex interactions between traffic participants that often govern their future trajectories. In this paper, we propose SocialFormer, an agent interaction-aware trajectory prediction method that leverages the semantic relationship between the target vehicle and surrounding vehicles by making use of the road topology. We also introduce an edge-enhanced heterogeneous graph transformer (EHGT) as the aggregator in a graph neural network (GNN) to encode the semantic and spatial agent interaction information. Additionally, we introduce a temporal encoder based on gated recurrent units (GRU) to model the temporal social behavior of agent movements. Finally, we present an information fusion framework that integrates agent encoding, lane encoding, and agent interaction encoding for a holistic representation of the traffic scene. We evaluate SocialFormer for the trajectory prediction task on the popular nuScenes benchmark and achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods do not model constraints crucial to ensure safety of the learned skill. Moreover, even when explicitly modelling constraints, they rely on the assumption of a known cost function, which limits their practical usability for task with unknown cost. In this work we propose a two-step optimization process that allow to estimate cost and constraints by decoupling the learning of cost functions from the identification of unknown constraints within the demonstrated trajectories. Initially, we identify the cost function by isolating the effect of constraints on parts of the demonstrations. Subsequently, a constraint leaning method is used to identify the unknown constraints. Our approach is validated both on simulated trajectories and a real robotic manipulation task. Our experiments show the impact that incorrect cost estimation has on the learned constraints and illustrate how the proposed method is able to infer unknown constraints, such as obstacles, from demonstrated trajectories without any initial knowledge of the cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS)</p></details> |

Due to the limited acquisition capabilities of edge devices, a lot of trajectories are recorded at a low sampling rate, which may lead to the effectiveness drop of urban applications. We aim to recover a high-sampled trajectory based on the low-sampled trajectory in free space, i.e., without road network information, to enhance the usability of trajectory data and support urban applications more effectively. Recent proposals targeting trajectory recovery often assume that trajectories are available at a central location, which fail to handle the decentralized trajectories and hurt privacy. To bridge the gap between decentralized training and trajectory recovery, we propose a lightweight framework, LightTR, for federated trajectory recovery based on a client-server architecture, while keeping the data decentralized and private in each client/platform center (e.g., each data center of a company). Specifically, considering the limited processing capabilities of edge devices, LightTR encompasses a light local trajectory embedding module that offers improved computational efficiency without compromising its feature extraction capabilities. LightTR also features a meta-knowledge enhanced local-global training scheme to reduce communication costs between the server and clients and thus further offer efficiency improvement. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v2)** | 2024-05-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unscented Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02753v1)** | 2024-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a nutshell, unscented trajectory optimization is the generation of optimal trajectories through the use of an unscented transform. Although unscented trajectory optimization was introduced by the authors about a decade ago, it is reintroduced in this paper as a special instantiation of tychastic optimal control theory. Tychastic optimal control theory (from \textit{Tyche}, the Greek goddess of chance) avoids the use of a Brownian motion and the resulting It\^{o} calculus even though it uses random variables across the entire spectrum of a problem formulation. This approach circumvents the enormous technical and numerical challenges associated with stochastic trajectory optimization. Furthermore, it is shown how a tychastic optimal control problem that involves nonlinear transformations of the expectation operator can be quickly instantiated using an unscented transform. These nonlinear transformations are particularly useful in managing trajectory dispersions be it associated with path constraints or targeted values of final-time conditions. This paper also presents a systematic and rapid process for formulating and computing the most desirable tychastic trajectory using an unscented transform. Numerical examples are used to illustrate how unscented trajectory optimization may be used for risk reduction and mission recovery caused by uncertainties and failures.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 11 figures 2023 AAS/AIAA Astrodynamics Specialist Conference, Big Sky, MT, Aug 13-17, 2023</p></details> |

This paper presents a deep representation learningbased phenotyping method to identify distinct groups of clinical trajectories of septic patients with ARF. For this retrospective study, we created a dataset from electronic medical records (EMR) consisting of data from sepsis patients admitted to medical intensive care units who required at least 24 hours of invasive mechanical ventilation at a quarternary care academic hospital in southeast USA for the years 2016-2021. A total of N=3349 patient encounters were included in this study. Clustering Representation Learning on Incomplete Time Series Data (CRLI) algorithm was applied to a parsimonious set of EMR variables in this data set. To validate the optimal number of clusters, the K-means algorithm was used in conjunction with dynamic time warping. Our model yielded four distinct patient phenotypes that were characterized as liver dysfunction/heterogeneous, hypercapnia, hypoxemia, and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome by a critical care expert. A Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare the 28-day mortality trends exhibited significant differences (p < 0.005) between the four phenotypes. The study demonstrates the utility of our deep representation learning-based approach in unraveling phenotypes that reflect the heterogeneity in sepsis-induced ARF in terms of different mortality outcomes and severity. These phenotypes might reveal important clinical insights into an effective prognosis and tailored treatment strategies.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

To address this task, this paper presents a novel trajectory prediction model tailored for accuracy in the face of heterogeneous and uncertain traffic scenarios. At the heart of this model lies the Characterized Diffusion Module, an innovative module designed to simulate traffic scenarios with inherent uncertainty. This module enriches the predictive process by infusing it with detailed semantic information, thereby enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy. Complementing this, our Spatio-Temporal (ST) Interaction Module captures the nuanced effects of traffic scenarios on vehicle dynamics across both spatial and temporal dimensions with remarkable effectiveness. Demonstrated through exhaustive evaluations, our model sets a new standard in trajectory prediction, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), Highway Drone (HighD), and Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) datasets across both short and extended temporal spans. This performance underscores the model's unparalleled adaptability and efficacy in navigating complex traffic scenarios, including highways, urban streets, and intersections.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[CGD: Constraint-Guided Diffusion Policies for UAV Trajectory Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01758v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional optimization-based planners, while effective, suffer from high computational costs, resulting in slow trajectory generation. A successful strategy to reduce computation time involves using Imitation Learning (IL) to develop fast neural network (NN) policies from those planners, which are treated as expert demonstrators. Although the resulting NN policies are effective at quickly generating trajectories similar to those from the expert, (1) their output does not explicitly account for dynamic feasibility, and (2) the policies do not accommodate changes in the constraints different from those used during training. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraint-Guided Diffusion (CGD), a novel IL-based approach to trajectory planning. CGD leverages a hybrid learning/online optimization scheme that combines diffusion policies with a surrogate efficient optimization problem, enabling the generation of collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories. The key ideas of CGD include dividing the original challenging optimization problem solved by the expert into two more manageable sub-problems: (a) efficiently finding collision-free paths, and (b) determining a dynamically-feasible time-parametrization for those paths to obtain a trajectory. Compared to conventional neural network architectures, we demonstrate through numerical evaluations significant improvements in performance and dynamic feasibility under scenarios with new constraints never encountered during training.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Feature Augmentation for AIS-Based Multi-Path Long-Term Vessel Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18948v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime transportation is paramount in achieving global economic growth, entailing concurrent ecological obligations in sustainability and safeguarding endangered marine species, most notably preserving large whale populations. In this regard, the Automatic Identification System (AIS) data plays a significant role by offering real-time streaming data on vessel movement, allowing enhanced traffic monitoring. This study explores using AIS data to prevent vessel-to-whale collisions by forecasting long-term vessel trajectories from engineered AIS data sequences. For such a task, we have developed an encoder-decoder model architecture using Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory Networks (Bi-LSTM) to predict the next 12 hours of vessel trajectories using 1 to 3 hours of AIS data as input. We feed the model with probabilistic features engineered from historical AIS data that refer to each trajectory's potential route and destination. The model then predicts the vessel's trajectory, considering these additional features by leveraging convolutional layers for spatial feature learning and a position-aware attention mechanism that increases the importance of recent timesteps of a sequence during temporal feature learning. The probabilistic features have an F1 Score of approximately 85% and 75% for each feature type, respectively, demonstrating their effectiveness in augmenting information to the neural network. We test our model on the Gulf of St. Lawrence, a region known to be the habitat of North Atlantic Right Whales (NARW). Our model achieved a high R2 score of over 98% using various techniques and features. It stands out among other approaches as it can make complex decisions during turnings and path selection. Our study highlights the potential of data engineering and trajectory forecasting models for marine life species preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Non-iterative Optimization of Trajectory and Radio Resource for Aerial Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01314v1)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a joint trajectory planning, user association, resource allocation, and power control problem to maximize proportional fairness in the aerial IoT network, considering practical end-to-end quality-of-service (QoS) and communication schedules. Though the problem is rather ancient, apart from the fact that the previous approaches have never considered user- and time-specific QoS, we point out a prevalent mistake in coordinate optimization approaches adopted by the majority of the literature. Coordinate optimization approaches, which repetitively optimize radio resources for a fixed trajectory and vice versa, generally converge to local optima when all variables are differentiable. However, these methods often stagnate at a non-stationary point, significantly degrading the network utility in mixed-integer problems such as joint trajectory and radio resource optimization. We detour this problem by converting the formulated problem into the Markov decision process (MDP). Exploiting the beneficial characteristics of the MDP, we design a non-iterative framework that cooperatively optimizes trajectory and radio resources without initial trajectory choice. The proposed framework can incorporate various trajectory planning algorithms such as the genetic algorithm, tree search, and reinforcement learning. Extensive comparisons with diverse baselines verify that the proposed framework significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art method, nearly achieving the global optimum.

Enhanced by a linear attention mechanism, the model achieves computational efficiency and reduced parameter overhead. Evaluations on the Argoverse, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets underscore MFTraj's robustness and adaptability, outperforming numerous benchmarks even in data-challenged scenarios without the need for additional information such as HD maps or vectorized maps. Importantly, it maintains competitive performance even in scenarios with substantial missing data, on par with most existing state-of-the-art models.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood (NLL) and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Previous methods either oversimplify object shapes, which results in a sacrifice of feasible space or rely on discrete sampling, which suffers from the "tunnel effect". To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory generation pipeline, which utilizes the Swept Volume Signed Distance Field (SVSDF) to guide trajectory optimization for Continuous Collision Avoidance (CCA). Our interdisciplinary approach, blending techniques from graphics and robotics, exhibits outstanding effectiveness in solving this problem. We formulate the computation of the SVSDF as a Generalized Semi-Infinite Programming model, and we solve for the numerical solutions at query points implicitly, thereby eliminating the need for explicit reconstruction of the surface. Our algorithm has been validated in a variety of complex scenarios and applies to robots of various dynamics, including both rigid and deformable shapes. It demonstrates exceptional universality and superior CCA performance compared to typical algorithms.

Each UAV collects sensing data from the GUs and then forwards the sensing data to the remote BS. The GUs first backscatter their data to the UAVs and then all UAVs forward data to the BS by the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmissions. We formulate a multi-stage stochastic optimization problem to minimize the long-term time-averaged age-of-information (AoI) by jointly optimizing the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and trajectory planning strategies. To solve this problem, we first model the dynamics of the GUs' AoI statuses by virtual queueing systems, and then propose the AoI-aware sensing scheduling and trajectory optimization (AoI-STO) algorithm. This allows us to transform the multi-stage AoI minimization problem into a series of per-slot control problems by using the Lyapunov optimization framework. In each time slot, the GUs' access control, the UAVs' beamforming, and mobility control strategies are updated by using the block coordinate descent (BCD) method according to the instant GUs' AoI statuses. Simulation results reveal that the proposed AoI-STO algorithm can reduce the overall AoI by more than 50%. The GUs' scheduling fairness is also improved greatly by adapting the GUs' access control compared with typical baseline schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE TVT</p></details> |

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. This paper describes a method SemanticFormer to predict multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. We extract high-level information in the form of semantic meta-paths from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. The proposed architecture comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder, which can capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents and between agents and road elements, and a predictor that fuses the different encodings and decodes trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module evaluates permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, submitted to RA-L</p></details> |

We provide a neuro-symbolic rule-based framework to conduct error correction and detection of these models to support eventual deployment in security applications. We provide a suite of experiments on several recent and state-of-the-art models and show an accuracy improvement of 1.7% over the SOTA model in the case where all classes are present in training and when 40% of classes are omitted from training, we obtain a 5.2% improvement (zero-shot) and 23.9% (few-shot) improvement over the SOTA model without resorting to retraining of the base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[G2LTraj: A Global-to-Local Generation Approach for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19330v1)** | 2024-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting future trajectories of traffic agents accurately holds substantial importance in various applications such as autonomous driving. Previous methods commonly infer all future steps of an agent either recursively or simultaneously. However, the recursive strategy suffers from the accumulated error, while the simultaneous strategy overlooks the constraints among future steps, resulting in kinematically infeasible predictions. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose G2LTraj, a plug-and-play global-to-local generation approach for trajectory prediction. Specifically, we generate a series of global key steps that uniformly cover the entire future time range. Subsequently, the local intermediate steps between the adjacent key steps are recursively filled in. In this way, we prevent the accumulated error from propagating beyond the adjacent key steps. Moreover, to boost the kinematical feasibility, we not only introduce the spatial constraints among key steps but also strengthen the temporal constraints among the intermediate steps. Finally, to ensure the optimal granularity of key steps, we design a selectable granularity strategy that caters to each predicted trajectory. Our G2LTraj significantly improves the performance of seven existing trajectory predictors across the ETH, UCY and nuScenes datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.

Yet, many recent deep learning methods suffer from a degraded performance on the challenging scenarios, mainly because these scenarios appear less frequently in the training data. To address such a long-tail issue, existing methods force challenging scenarios closer together in the feature space during training to trigger information sharing among them for more robust learning. These methods, however, primarily rely on the motion patterns to characterize scenarios, omitting more informative contextual information, such as interactions and scene layout. We argue that exploiting such information not only improves prediction accuracy but also scene compliance of the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose to incorporate richer training dynamics information into a prototypical contrastive learning framework. More specifically, we propose a two-stage process. First, we generate rich contextual features using a baseline encoder-decoder framework. These features are split into clusters based on the model's output errors, using the training dynamics information, and a prototype is computed within each cluster. Second, we retrain the model using the prototypes in a contrastive learning framework. We conduct empirical evaluations of our approach using two large-scale naturalistic datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance by improving accuracy and scene compliance on the long-tail samples. Furthermore, we perform experiments on a subset of the clusters to highlight the additional benefit of our approach in reducing training bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>2024 ...</summary><p>2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV)</p></details> |

Firstly, we extract spatial features from fighter trajectory data using CNN, aggregate spatial features of multiple fighters using the social-pooling module to capture geographic information and positional relationships in the trajectories, and use the attention mechanism to capture mutated trajectory features in air combat; subsequently, we extract temporal features by using the memory nature of LSTM to capture long-term temporal dependence in the trajectories; and finally, we merge the temporal and spatial features to predict the flight trajectories of enemy fighters. Extensive simulation experiments verify that the proposed method improves the trajectory prediction accuracy compared to the original CNN-LSTM method, with the improvements of 32% and 34% in ADE and FDE indicators.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |

Although recent studies have demonstrated the advantages of achieving map-constrained trajectory recovery via an end-to-end manner, they still face two significant challenges. Firstly, existing methods are mostly sequence-based models. It is extremely hard for them to comprehensively capture the micro-semantics of individual trajectory, including the information of each GPS point and the movement between two GPS points. Secondly, existing approaches ignore the impact of the macro-semantics, i.e., the road conditions and the people's shared travel preferences reflected by a group of trajectories. To address the above challenges, we propose a Micro-Macro Spatial-Temporal Graph-based Encoder-Decoder (MM-STGED). Specifically, we model each trajectory as a graph to efficiently describe the micro-semantics of trajectory and design a novel message-passing mechanism to learn trajectory representations. Additionally, we extract the macro-semantics of trajectories and further incorporate them into a well-designed graph-based decoder to guide trajectory recovery.

This paper seeks to compute trajectory plans for which a robot is guaranteed to reach a goal and to avoid obstacles in the specific near-danger case, also known as a narrow gap, where the agent starts near the goal, but must navigate through tight obstacles that block its path. The proposed method builds off of a common approach of using a simplified planning model to generate plans, which are then tracked using a high-fidelity tracking model and controller. Existing safe planning approaches use reachability analysis to overapproximate the error between these models, but this introduces additional numerical approximation error and thereby conservativeness that prevents goal-reaching. The present work instead proposes a Piecewise Affine Reach-avoid Computation (PARC) method to tightly approximate the reachable set of the planning model. PARC significantly reduces conservativeness through a careful choice of the planning model and set representation, along with an effective approach to handling time-varying tracking errors. The utility of this method is demonstrated through extensive numerical experiments in which PARC outperforms state-of-the-art reach-avoid methods in near-danger goal-reaching. Furthermore, in a simulated demonstration, PARC enables the generation of provably-safe extreme vehicle dynamics drift parking maneuvers. A preliminary hardware demo on a TurtleBot3 also validates the method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally to the work.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging environmental information to achieve three-dimension collision-free trajectory planning is the prerequisite to ensure airspace security. However, the timely information of surrounding situation is difficult to acquire by UAVs, which further brings security risks. As a mature technology leveraged in traditional civil aviation, the automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) realizes continuous surveillance of the information of aircrafts. Consequently, we leverage ADS-B for surveillance and information broadcasting, and divide the aerial airspace into multiple sub-airspaces to improve flight safety in UAV trajectory planning. In detail, we propose the secure sub-airspaces planning (SSP) algorithm and particle swarm optimization rapidly-exploring random trees (PSO-RRT) algorithm for the UAV trajectory planning in law-altitude airspace. The performance of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations and the results show that SSP reduces both the maximum number of UAVs in the sub-airspace and the length of the trajectory, and PSO-RRT reduces the cost of UAV trajectory in the sub-airspace.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Adaptive Informative Path Planning with Multimodal Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18374v1)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of an autonomous agent equipped with multiple sensors, each with different sensing precision and energy costs. The agent's goal is to explore the environment and gather information subject to its resource constraints in unknown, partially observable environments. The challenge lies in reasoning about the effects of sensing and movement while respecting the agent's resource and dynamic constraints. We formulate the problem as a trajectory optimization problem and solve it using a projection-based trajectory optimization approach where the objective is to reduce the variance of the Gaussian process world belief. Our approach outperforms previous approaches in long horizon trajectories by achieving an overall variance reduction of up to 85% and reducing the root-mean square error in the environment belief by 50%. This approach was developed in support of rover path planning for the NASA VIPER Mission.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Control, Decision and Information Technologies</p></details> |
| **[Compressed Deepfake Video Detection Based on 3D Spatiotemporal Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18149v1)** | 2024-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The misuse of deepfake technology by malicious actors poses a potential threat to nations, societies, and individuals. However, existing methods for detecting deepfakes primarily focus on uncompressed videos, such as noise characteristics, local textures, or frequency statistics. When applied to compressed videos, these methods experience a decrease in detection performance and are less suitable for real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a deepfake video detection method based on 3D spatiotemporal trajectories. Specifically, we utilize a robust 3D model to construct spatiotemporal motion features, integrating feature details from both 2D and 3D frames to mitigate the influence of large head rotation angles or insufficient lighting within frames. Furthermore, we separate facial expressions from head movements and design a sequential analysis method based on phase space motion trajectories to explore the feature differences between genuine and fake faces in deepfake videos. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the performance of our proposed method on several compressed deepfake benchmarks. The robustness of the well-designed features is verified by calculating the consistent distribution of facial landmarks before and after video compression.Our method yields satisfactory results and showcases its potential for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMEND: A Mixture of Experts Framework for Long-tailed Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08698v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of pedestrians' future motions is critical for intelligent driving systems. Developing models for this task requires rich datasets containing diverse sets of samples. However, the existing naturalistic trajectory prediction datasets are generally imbalanced in favor of simpler samples and lack challenging scenarios. Such a long-tail effect causes prediction models to underperform on the tail portion of the data distribution containing safety-critical scenarios. Previous methods tackle the long-tail problem using methods such as contrastive learning and class-conditioned hypernetworks. These approaches, however, are not modular and cannot be applied to many machine learning architectures. In this work, we propose a modular model-agnostic framework for trajectory prediction that leverages a specialized mixture of experts. In our approach, each expert is trained with a specialized skill with respect to a particular part of the data. To produce predictions, we utilise a router network that selects the best expert by generating relative confidence scores. We conduct experimentation on common pedestrian trajectory prediction datasets and show that our method improves performance on long-tail scenarios. We further conduct ablation studies to highlight the contribution of different proposed components.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative model that infuses cognitive insights into trajectory prediction, focusing on perceived safety and dynamic decision-making. Distinct from traditional approaches, our model excels in analyzing interactions and behavior patterns in mixed autonomy traffic scenarios. It represents a significant leap forward, achieving marked performance improvements on several key datasets. Specifically, it surpasses existing benchmarks with gains of 16.2% on the Next Generation Simulation (NGSIM), 27.4% on the Highway Drone (HighD), and 19.8% on the Macao Connected Autonomous Driving (MoCAD) dataset. Our proposed model shows exceptional proficiency in handling corner cases, essential for real-world applications. Moreover, its robustness is evident in scenarios with missing or limited data, outperforming most of the state-of-the-art baselines. This adaptability and resilience position our model as a viable tool for real-world autonomous driving systems, heralding a new standard in vehicle trajectory prediction for enhanced safety and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

Further, it allows automated analysis of recorded motion data. Many clustering algorithms for trajectories build upon distance metrics that are based on pointwise Euclidean distances. However, our work indicates that focusing on salient characteristics is often sufficient. We present a novel distance measure for motion plans consisting of state and control trajectories that is based on a compressed representation built from their main features. This approach allows a flexible choice of feature classes relevant to the respective task. The distance measure is used in agglomerative hierarchical clustering. We compare our method with the widely used dynamic time warping algorithm on test sets of motion plans for the Furuta pendulum and the Manutec robot arm and on real-world data from a human motion dataset. The proposed method demonstrates slight advantages in clustering and strong advantages in runtime, especially for long trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2023 IEEE-RAS 22nd International Conference on Humanoid Robots (Humanoids).

| **[Neural Interaction Energy for Multi-Agent Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16579v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maintaining temporal stability is crucial in multi-agent trajectory prediction. Insufficient regularization to uphold this stability often results in fluctuations in kinematic states, leading to inconsistent predictions and the amplification of errors. In this study, we introduce a framework called Multi-Agent Trajectory prediction via neural interaction Energy (MATE). This framework assesses the interactive motion of agents by employing neural interaction energy, which captures the dynamics of interactions and illustrates their influence on the future trajectories of agents. To bolster temporal stability, we introduce two constraints: inter-agent interaction constraint and intra-agent motion constraint. These constraints work together to ensure temporal stability at both the system and agent levels, effectively mitigating prediction fluctuations inherent in multi-agent systems. Comparative evaluations against previous methods on four diverse datasets highlight the superior prediction accuracy and generalization capabilities of our model.</p></details> |  |

This task is of major importance across multiple disciplines, in which also sequences like trajectories can be considered as a group. As groups become more diverse in heterogeneity and size, detecting group anomalies becomes challenging, especially without supervision. Though Recurrent Neural Networks are well established deep sequence models, their performance can decrease with increasing sequence lengths. Hence, this paper introduces GADformer, a BERT-based model for attention-driven GAD on trajectories in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. We demonstrate how group anomalies can be detected by attention-based GAD. We also introduce the Block-Attention-anomaly-Score (BAS) to enhance model transparency by scoring attention patterns. In addition to that, synthetic trajectory generation allows various ablation studies. In extensive experiments we investigate our approach versus related works in their robustness for trajectory noise and novelties on synthetic data and three real world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2024, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |

They generate 3D box candidates from the first-stage dense detector, followed by different temporal aggregation methods. However, these approaches require per-frame objects or whole point clouds, posing challenges related to memory bank utilization. Moreover, point clouds and trajectory features are combined solely based on concatenation, which may neglect effective interactions between them. In this paper, we propose a point-trajectory transformer with long short-term memory for efficient temporal 3D object detection. To this end, we only utilize point clouds of current-frame objects and their historical trajectories as input to minimize the memory bank storage requirement. Furthermore, we introduce modules to encode trajectory features, focusing on long short-term and future-aware perspectives, and then effectively aggregate them with point cloud features. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo dataset to demonstrate that our approach performs well against state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Adapting Large Multimodal Models to Distribution Shifts: The Role of In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12217v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies indicate that large multimodal models (LMMs) are highly robust against natural distribution shifts, often surpassing previous baselines. Despite this, domain-specific adaptation is still necessary, particularly in specialized areas like healthcare. Due to the impracticality of fine-tuning LMMs given their vast parameter space, this work investigates in-context learning (ICL) as an effective alternative for enhancing LMMs' adaptability. We find that the success of ICL heavily relies on the choice of demonstration, mirroring challenges seen in large language models but introducing unique complexities for LMMs facing distribution shifts. Our study addresses this by evaluating an unsupervised ICL method, TopKNearestPR, which selects in-context examples through a nearest example search based on feature similarity. We uncover that its effectiveness is limited by the deficiencies of pre-trained vision encoders under distribution shift scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose InvariantSelectPR, a novel method leveraging Class-conditioned Contrastive Invariance (CCI) for more robust demonstration selection. Specifically, CCI enhances pre-trained vision encoders by improving their discriminative capabilities across different classes and ensuring invariance to domain-specific variations. This enhancement allows the encoders to effectively identify and retrieve the most informative examples, which are then used to guide LMMs in adapting to new query samples under varying distributions. Our experiments show that InvariantSelectPR substantially improves the adaptability of LMMs, achieving significant performance gains on benchmark datasets, with a 34.2%$\uparrow$ accuracy increase in 7-shot on Camelyon17 and 16.9%$\uparrow$ increase in 7-shot on HAM10000 compared to the baseline zero-shot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This paper explores the multifaceted impact of LLMs on robotics, addressing key challenges and opportunities for leveraging these models across various domains. By categorizing and analyzing LLM applications within core robotics elements -- communication, perception, planning, and control -- we aim to provide actionable insights for researchers seeking to integrate LLMs into their robotic systems. Our investigation focuses on LLMs developed post-GPT-3.5, primarily in text-based modalities while also considering multimodal approaches for perception and control. We offer comprehensive guidelines and examples for prompt engineering, facilitating beginners' access to LLM-based robotics solutions. Through tutorial-level examples and structured prompt construction, we illustrate how LLM-guided enhancements can be seamlessly integrated into robotics applications. This survey serves as a roadmap for researchers navigating the evolving landscape of LLM-driven robotics, offering a comprehensive overview and practical guidance for harnessing the power of language models in robotics development.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 1 figure, Submitted to Intelligent Service Robotics (ISR)</p></details> |

Existing text-to-table datasets are typically oriented English, limiting the research in non-English languages. Meanwhile, the emergence of large language models (LLMs) has shown great success as general task solvers in multi-lingual settings (e.g., ChatGPT), theoretically enabling text-to-table in other languages. In this paper, we propose a Chinese text-to-table dataset, CT-Eval, to benchmark LLMs on this task. Our preliminary analysis of English text-to-table datasets highlights two key factors for dataset construction: data diversity and data hallucination. Inspired by this, the CT-Eval dataset selects a popular Chinese multidisciplinary online encyclopedia as the source and covers 28 domains to ensure data diversity. To minimize data hallucination, we first train an LLM to judge and filter out the task samples with hallucination, then employ human annotators to clean the hallucinations in the validation and testing sets. After this process, CT-Eval contains 88.6K task samples. Using CT-Eval, we evaluate the performance of open-source and closed-source LLMs. Our results reveal that zero-shot LLMs (including GPT-4) still have a significant performance gap compared with human judgment. Furthermore, after fine-tuning, open-source LLMs can significantly improve their text-to-table ability, outperforming GPT-4 by a large margin. In short, CT-Eval not only helps researchers evaluate and quickly understand the Chinese text-to-table ability of existing LLMs but also serves as a valuable resource to significantly improve the text-to-table performance of LLMs.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Eliciting Problem Specifications via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12147v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cognitive systems generally require a human to translate a problem definition into some specification that the cognitive system can use to attempt to solve the problem or perform the task. In this paper, we illustrate that large language models (LLMs) can be utilized to map a problem class, defined in natural language, into a semi-formal specification that can then be utilized by an existing reasoning and learning system to solve instances from the problem class. We present the design of LLM-enabled cognitive task analyst agent(s). Implemented with LLM agents, this system produces a definition of problem spaces for tasks specified in natural language. LLM prompts are derived from the definition of problem spaces in the AI literature and general problem-solving strategies (Polya's How to Solve It). A cognitive system can then use the problem-space specification, applying domain-general problem solving strategies ("weak methods" such as search), to solve multiple instances of problems from the problem class. This result, while preliminary, suggests the potential for speeding cognitive systems research via disintermediation of problem formulation while also retaining core capabilities of cognitive systems, such as robust inference and online learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, Appendix.

However, controlling the distribution of recommended items remains a challenge. This leads to suboptimal performance due to the failure to capture rapidly changing data distributions, such as item popularity, on targeted conversational recommendation platforms. In conversational recommendation, LLMs recommend items by generating the titles (as multiple tokens) autoregressively, making it difficult to obtain and control the recommendations over all items. Thus, we propose a Reindex-Then-Adapt (RTA) framework, which converts multi-token item titles into single tokens within LLMs, and then adjusts the probability distributions over these single-token item titles accordingly. The RTA framework marries the benefits of both LLMs and traditional recommender systems (RecSys): understanding complex queries as LLMs do; while efficiently controlling the recommended item distributions in conversational recommendations as traditional RecSys do. Our framework demonstrates improved accuracy metrics across three different conversational recommendation datasets and two adaptation settings</p></details> |  |
| **[Imp: Highly Capable Large Multimodal Models for Mobile Devices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12107v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), recent large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown remarkable versatility in open-world multimodal understanding. Nevertheless, they are usually parameter-heavy and computation-intensive, thus hindering their applicability in resource-constrained scenarios. To this end, several lightweight LMMs have been proposed successively to maximize the capabilities under constrained scale (e.g., 3B). Despite the encouraging results achieved by these methods, most of them only focus on one or two aspects of the design space, and the key design choices that influence model capability have not yet been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study for lightweight LMMs from the aspects of model architecture, training strategy, and training data. Based on our findings, we obtain Imp -- a family of highly capable LMMs at the 2B-4B scales. Notably, our Imp-3B model steadily outperforms all the existing lightweight LMMs of similar size, and even surpasses the state-of-the-art LMMs at the 13B scale. With low-bit quantization and resolution reduction techniques, our Imp model can be deployed on a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8Gen3 mobile chip with a high inference speed of about 13 tokens/s.</p></details> | 19 pages, 6 figures |

In this paper, leveraging the advancements in large language models (LLMs), we address two key objectives:(1) Distinguishing between mathematical reasoning and error correction; (2) Exploring strategies to enhance the error correction capabilities of LLMs in mathematics to solve MWPC task. We noticed that, in real-time education,assisting students in recognizing their mistakes is more crucial than simply providing correct answers. However, current research tends to prioritize obtaining accurate solutions to math problems rather than correcting potentially incorrect ones. Therefore, we modify the research paradigm, demonstrating that improving mathematical reasoning abilities does not equate to mastery in error correction. Meanwhile, we propose a novel method called diagnostic-oriented promping(DOP) aimed at facilitating LLMs to excel in error correction. In experiments, DOP has shown outstanding performance, highlighting its significant impact. We argue that in mathematical education, the demand for outstanding correctors surpasses that for proficient reasoners.

However, existing toxicity benchmarks are overwhelmingly focused on English, posing serious risks to deploying LLMs in other languages. We address this by introducing PolygloToxicityPrompts (PTP), the first large-scale multilingual toxicity evaluation benchmark of 425K naturally occurring prompts spanning 17 languages. We overcome the scarcity of naturally occurring toxicity in web-text and ensure coverage across languages with varying resources by automatically scraping over 100M web-text documents. Using PTP, we investigate research questions to study the impact of model size, prompt language, and instruction and preference-tuning methods on toxicity by benchmarking over 60 LLMs. Notably, we find that toxicity increases as language resources decrease or model size increases. Although instruction- and preference-tuning reduce toxicity, the choice of preference-tuning method does not have any significant impact. Our findings shed light on crucial shortcomings of LLM safeguarding and highlight areas for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Special Characters Attack: Toward Scalable Training Data Extraction From Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05990v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on a wide range of tasks. However, recent studies have shown that LLMs can memorize training data and simple repeated tokens can trick the model to leak the data. In this paper, we take a step further and show that certain special characters or their combinations with English letters are stronger memory triggers, leading to more severe data leakage. The intuition is that, since LLMs are trained with massive data that contains a substantial amount of special characters (e.g. structural symbols {, } of JSON files, and @, # in emails and online posts), the model may memorize the co-occurrence between these special characters and the raw texts. This motivates us to propose a simple but effective Special Characters Attack (SCA) to induce training data leakage. Our experiments verify the high effectiveness of SCA against state-of-the-art LLMs: they can leak diverse training data, such as code corpus, web pages, and personally identifiable information, and sometimes generate non-stop outputs as a byproduct. We further show that the composition of the training data corpus can be revealed by inspecting the leaked data -- one crucial piece of information for pre-training high-performance LLMs. Our work can help understand the sensitivity of LLMs to special characters and identify potential areas for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAMBER: A Benchmark of Identifying and Clarifying Ambiguous Information Needs in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12063v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to meet user information needs, but their effectiveness in dealing with user queries that contain various types of ambiguity remains unknown, ultimately risking user trust and satisfaction. To this end, we introduce CLAMBER, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs using a well-organized taxonomy. Building upon the taxonomy, we construct ~12K high-quality data to assess the strengths, weaknesses, and potential risks of various off-the-shelf LLMs. Our findings indicate the limited practical utility of current LLMs in identifying and clarifying ambiguous user queries, even enhanced by chain-of-thought (CoT) and few-shot prompting. These techniques may result in overconfidence in LLMs and yield only marginal enhancements in identifying ambiguity. Furthermore, current LLMs fall short in generating high-quality clarifying questions due to a lack of conflict resolution and inaccurate utilization of inherent knowledge. In this paper, CLAMBER presents a guidance and promotes further research on proactive and trustworthy LLMs. Our dataset is available at https://github.com/zt991211/CLAMBER</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |

Nevertheless, these machine companions of ours have a critical flaw: the huge amount of data which endows them with vast and diverse knowledge, also exposes them to the inevitable toxicity and bias. While most LLMs incorporate defense mechanisms to prevent the generation of harmful content, these safeguards can be easily bypassed with minimal prompt engineering. In this paper, we introduce the new Thoroughly Engineered Toxicity (TET) dataset, comprising manually crafted prompts designed to nullify the protective layers of such models. Through extensive evaluations, we demonstrate the pivotal role of TET in providing a rigorous benchmark for evaluation of toxicity awareness in several popular LLMs: it highlights the toxicity in the LLMs that might remain hidden when using normal prompts, thus revealing subtler issues in their behavior.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2024 |

Recent advances have incorporated deep learning techniques to improve the accuracy of protein-ligand structure prediction. Nevertheless, the experimental validation of docking conformations remains costly, it raises concerns regarding the generalizability of these deep learning-based methods due to the limited training data. In this work, we show that by pre-training on a large-scale docking conformation generated by traditional physics-based docking tools and then fine-tuning with a limited set of experimentally validated receptor-ligand complexes, we can obtain a protein-ligand structure prediction model with outstanding performance. Specifically, this process involved the generation of 100 million docking conformations for protein-ligand pairings, an endeavor consuming roughly 1 million CPU core days. The proposed model, HelixDock, aims to acquire the physical knowledge encapsulated by the physics-based docking tools during the pre-training phase. HelixDock has been rigorously benchmarked against both physics-based and deep learning-based baselines, demonstrating its exceptional precision and robust transferability in predicting binding confirmation. In addition, our investigation reveals the scaling laws governing pre-trained protein-ligand structure prediction models, indicating a consistent enhancement in performance with increases in model parameters and the volume of pre-training data. Moreover, we applied HelixDock to several drug discovery-related tasks to validate its practical utility. HelixDock demonstrates outstanding capabilities on both cross-docking and structure-based virtual screening benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

A proposed deployment use case is psychotherapy, where a LLM-powered chatbot can treat a patient undergoing a mental health crisis. Deployment of LLMs for mental health response could hypothetically broaden access to psychotherapy and provide new possibilities for personalizing care. However, recent high-profile failures, like damaging dieting advice offered by the Tessa chatbot to patients with eating disorders, have led to doubt about their reliability in high-stakes and safety-critical settings. In this work, we develop an evaluation framework for determining whether LLM response is a viable and ethical path forward for the automation of mental health treatment. Using human evaluation with trained clinicians and automatic quality-of-care metrics grounded in psychology research, we compare the responses provided by peer-to-peer responders to those provided by a state-of-the-art LLM. We show that LLMs like GPT-4 use implicit and explicit cues to infer patient demographics like race. We then show that there are statistically significant discrepancies between patient subgroups: Responses to Black posters consistently have lower empathy than for any other demographic group (2%-13% lower than the control group). Promisingly, we do find that the manner in which responses are generated significantly impacts the quality of the response. We conclude by proposing safety guidelines for the potential deployment of LLMs for mental health response.</p></details> | Under review |

These architectures are the basis of the innovative, cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) that have produced a huge buzz in several fields and industrial sectors, among the ones education stands out. Accordingly, these generative Artificial Intelligence-based solutions have directed the change in techniques and the evolution in educational methods and contents, along with network infrastructure, towards high-quality learning. Given the popularity of LLMs, this review seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of those solutions designed specifically to generate and evaluate educational materials and which involve students and teachers in their design or experimental plan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review of educational applications (e.g., student assessment) of LLMs. As expected, the most common role of these systems is as virtual tutors for automatic question generation. Moreover, the most popular models are GTP-3 and BERT. However, due to the continuous launch of new generative models, new works are expected to be published shortly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Augmentation for Text-based Person Retrieval Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11971v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-based Person Retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve person images that match the description given a text query. The performance improvement of the TPR model relies on high-quality data for supervised training. However, it is difficult to construct a large-scale, high-quality TPR dataset due to expensive annotation and privacy protection. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have approached or even surpassed human performance on many NLP tasks, creating the possibility to expand high-quality TPR datasets. This paper proposes an LLM-based Data Augmentation (LLM-DA) method for TPR. LLM-DA uses LLMs to rewrite the text in the current TPR dataset, achieving high-quality expansion of the dataset concisely and efficiently. These rewritten texts are able to increase the diversity of vocabulary and sentence structure while retaining the original key concepts and semantic information. In order to alleviate the hallucinations of LLMs, LLM-DA introduces a Text Faithfulness Filter (TFF) to filter out unfaithful rewritten text. To balance the contributions of original text and augmented text, a Balanced Sampling Strategy (BSS) is proposed to control the proportion of original text and augmented text used for training. LLM-DA is a plug-and-play method that can be easily integrated into various TPR models. Comprehensive experiments on three TPR benchmarks show that LLM-DA can improve the retrieval performance of current TPR models.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs), specifically the BioMistral and Llama3 models, were fine-tuned and employed to create lay summaries from complex scientific texts. The summarization performance was enhanced through various approaches, including instruction tuning, few-shot learning, and prompt variations tailored to incorporate specific context information. The experiments demonstrated that fine-tuning generally led to the best performance across most evaluated metrics. Few-shot learning notably improved the models' ability to generate relevant and factually accurate texts, particularly when using a well-crafted prompt. Additionally, a Dynamic Expert Selection (DES) mechanism to optimize the selection of text outputs based on readability and factuality metrics was developed. Out of 54 participants, the WisPerMed team reached the 4th place, measured by readability, factuality, and relevance. Determined by the overall score, our approach improved upon the baseline by approx. 5.5 percentage points and was only approx 1.5 percentage points behind the first place.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 6 figure, 3 tables, submitted to: BIONLP 2024 and Shared Tasks @ ACL 2024</p></details> |

It is crucial to ensure accurate latitude and longitude coordinates for UAVs, especially when the global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) are disrupted and unreliable. Existing visual localization methods achieve autonomous visual localization without error accumulation by matching the ground-down view image of UAV with the ortho satellite maps. However, collecting UAV ground-down view images across diverse locations is costly, leading to a scarcity of large-scale datasets for real-world scenarios. Existing datasets for UAV visual localization are often limited to small geographic areas or are focused only on urban regions with distinct textures. To address this, we define the UAV visual localization task by determining the UAV's real position coordinates on a large-scale satellite map based on the captured ground-down view. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, UAV-VisLoc, to facilitate the UAV visual localization task. This dataset comprises images from diverse drones across 11 locations in China, capturing a range of topographical features. The dataset features images from fixed-wing drones and multi-terrain drones, captured at different altitudes and orientations. Our dataset includes 6,742 drone images and 11 satellite maps, with metadata such as latitude, longitude, altitude, and capture date. Our dataset is tailored to support both the training and testing of models by providing a diverse and extensive data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Intestine 3D Shape Refinement Using Point Diffusion Models for Digital Phantom Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08289v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D modeling of human organs plays a crucial role in building computational phantoms for virtual imaging trials. However, generating anatomically plausible reconstructions of organ surfaces from computed tomography scans remains challenging for many structures in the human body. This challenge is particularly evident when dealing with the large intestine. In this study, we leverage recent advancements in geometric deep learning and denoising diffusion probabilistic models to refine the segmentation results of the large intestine. We begin by representing the organ as point clouds sampled from the surface of the 3D segmentation mask. Subsequently, we employ a hierarchical variational autoencoder to obtain global and local latent representations of the organ's shape. We train two conditional denoising diffusion models in the hierarchical latent space to perform shape refinement. To further enhance our method, we incorporate a state-of-the-art surface reconstruction model, allowing us to generate smooth meshes from the obtained complete point clouds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in capturing both the global distribution of the organ's shape and its fine details. Our complete refinement pipeline demonstrates remarkable enhancements in surface representation compared to the initial segmentation, reducing the Chamfer distance by 70%, the Hausdorff distance by 32%, and the Earth Mover's distance by 6%. By combining geometric deep learning, denoising diffusion models, and advanced surface reconstruction techniques, our proposed method offers a promising solution for accurately modeling the large intestine's surface and can easily be extended to other anatomical structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective Clustering on Large Attributed Bipartite Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11922v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attributed bipartite graphs (ABGs) are an expressive data model for describing the interactions between two sets of heterogeneous nodes that are associated with rich attributes, such as customer-product purchase networks and author-paper authorship graphs. Partitioning the target node set in such graphs into k disjoint clusters (referred to as k-ABGC) finds widespread use in various domains, including social network analysis, recommendation systems, information retrieval, and bioinformatics. However, the majority of existing solutions towards k-ABGC either overlook attribute information or fail to capture bipartite graph structures accurately, engendering severely compromised result quality. The severity of these issues is accentuated in real ABGs, which often encompass millions of nodes and a sheer volume of attribute data, rendering effective k-ABGC over such graphs highly challenging. In this paper, we propose TPO, an effective and efficient approach to k-ABGC that achieves superb clustering performance on multiple real datasets. TPO obtains high clustering quality through two major contributions: (i) a novel formulation and transformation of the k-ABGC problem based on multi-scale attribute affinity specialized for capturing attribute affinities between nodes with the consideration of their multi-hop connections in ABGs, and (ii) a highly efficient solver that includes a suite of carefully-crafted optimizations for sidestepping explicit affinity matrix construction and facilitating faster convergence. Extensive experiments, comparing TPO against 19 baselines over 5 real ABGs, showcase the superior clustering quality of TPO measured against ground-truth labels. Moreover, compared to the state of the arts, TPO is often more than 40x faster over both small and large ABGs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The technical report for the paper was accepted to KDD 2024. 14 pages</p></details> |
| **[Information Leakage from Embedding in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11916v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding data privacy. This study aims to investigate the potential for privacy invasion through input reconstruction attacks, in which a malicious model provider could potentially recover user inputs from embeddings. We first propose two base methods to reconstruct original texts from a model's hidden states. We find that these two methods are effective in attacking the embeddings from shallow layers, but their effectiveness decreases when attacking embeddings from deeper layers. To address this issue, we then present Embed Parrot, a Transformer-based method, to reconstruct input from embeddings in deep layers. Our analysis reveals that Embed Parrot effectively reconstructs original inputs from the hidden states of ChatGLM-6B and Llama2-7B, showcasing stable performance across various token lengths and data distributions. To mitigate the risk of privacy breaches, we introduce a defense mechanism to deter exploitation of the embedding reconstruction process. Our findings emphasize the importance of safeguarding user privacy in distributed learning systems and contribute valuable insights to enhance the security protocols within such environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unveiling and Manipulating Prompt Influence in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11891v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompts play a crucial role in guiding the responses of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the intricate role of individual tokens in prompts, known as input saliency, in shaping the responses remains largely underexplored. Existing saliency methods either misalign with LLM generation objectives or rely heavily on linearity assumptions, leading to potential inaccuracies. To address this, we propose Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD), a \textcolor{black}{simple yet effective} approach to unveil and manipulate the role of prompts in generating LLM outputs. TDD leverages the robust interpreting capabilities of the language model head (LM head) to assess input saliency. It projects input tokens into the embedding space and then estimates their significance based on distribution dynamics over the vocabulary. We introduce three TDD variants: forward, backward, and bidirectional, each offering unique insights into token relevance. Extensive experiments reveal that the TDD surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with a big margin in elucidating the causal relationships between prompts and LLM outputs. Beyond mere interpretation, we apply TDD to two prompt manipulation tasks for controlled text generation: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment steering. Empirical results underscore TDD's proficiency in identifying both toxic and sentimental cues in prompts, subsequently mitigating toxicity or modulating sentiment in the generated content.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

However, there's a noticeable gap in structured research applying LVMs to human-robot interaction (HRI), despite extensive evidence supporting the efficacy of vision models in enhancing interactions between humans and robots. Recognizing the vast and anticipated potential, we introduce an initial design space that incorporates domain-specific LVMs, chosen for their superior performance over normal models. We delve into three primary dimensions: HRI contexts, vision-based tasks, and specific domains. The empirical evaluation was implemented among 15 experts across six evaluated metrics, showcasing the primary efficacy in relevant decision-making scenarios. We explore the process of ideation and potential application scenarios, envisioning this design space as a foundational guideline for future HRI system design, emphasizing accurate domain alignment and model selection.</p></details> |  |
| **[xFinder: Robust and Pinpoint Answer Extraction for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11874v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The continuous advancement of large language models (LLMs) has brought increasing attention to the critical issue of developing fair and reliable methods for evaluating their performance. Particularly, the emergence of subjective or non-subjective cheating phenomena, such as test set leakage and prompt format overfitting, poses significant challenges to the reliable evaluation of LLMs. Since evaluation frameworks often utilize Regular Expression (RegEx) for answer extraction, some models may adjust their responses to comply with specific formats that are easily extractable by RegEx. Nevertheless, the key answer extraction module based on RegEx frequently suffers from extraction errors. This paper conducts a comprehensive analysis of the entire LLM evaluation chain, demonstrating that optimizing the key answer extraction module can improve extraction accuracy, reduce LLMs' reliance on specific answer formats, and enhance the reliability of LLM evaluation. To address these issues, we propose xFinder, a model specifically designed for key answer extraction. As part of this process, we create a specialized dataset, the Key Answer Finder (KAF) dataset, to ensure effective model training and evaluation. Through generalization testing and evaluation in real-world scenarios, the results demonstrate that the smallest xFinder model with only 500 million parameters achieves an average answer extraction accuracy of 93.42%. In contrast, RegEx accuracy in the best evaluation framework is 74.38%. xFinder exhibits stronger robustness and higher accuracy compared to existing evaluation frameworks.

Current methods for Multimodal Sarcasm Target Identification (MSTI) predominantly focus on superficial indicators in an end-to-end manner, overlooking the nuanced understanding of multimodal sarcasm conveyed through both the text and image. This paper proposes a versatile MSTI framework with a coarse-to-fine paradigm, by augmenting sarcasm explainability with reasoning and pre-training knowledge. Inspired by the powerful capacity of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) on multimodal reasoning, we first engage LMMs to generate competing rationales for coarser-grained pre-training of a small language model on multimodal sarcasm detection. We then propose fine-tuning the model for finer-grained sarcasm target identification. Our framework is thus empowered to adeptly unveil the intricate targets within multimodal sarcasm and mitigate the negative impact posed by potential noise inherently in LMMs. Experimental results demonstrate that our model far outperforms state-of-the-art MSTI methods, and markedly exhibits explainability in deciphering sarcasm as well.</p></details> | ACL 2024 |

The long-standing endeavor of design automation has gained new momentum with the rise of large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces Language Hyper-Heuristics (LHHs), an emerging variant of Hyper-Heuristics that leverages LLMs for heuristic generation, featuring minimal manual intervention and open-ended heuristic spaces. To empower LHHs, we present Reflective Evolution (ReEvo), a novel integration of evolutionary search for efficiently exploring the heuristic space, and LLM reflections to provide verbal gradients within the space. Across five heterogeneous algorithmic types, six different COPs, and both white-box and black-box views of COPs, ReEvo yields state-of-the-art and competitive meta-heuristics, evolutionary algorithms, heuristics, and neural solvers, while being more sample-efficient than prior LHHs.

The highlights of RoScenes include significantly large perception area, full scene coverage and crowded traffic. More specifically, our dataset achieves surprising 21.13M 3D annotations within 64,000 $m^2$. To relieve the expensive costs of roadside 3D labeling, we present a novel BEV-to-3D joint annotation pipeline to efficiently collect such a large volume of data. After that, we organize a comprehensive study for current BEV methods on RoScenes in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. Tested methods suffer from the vast perception area and variation of sensor layout across scenes, resulting in performance levels falling below expectations. To this end, we propose RoBEV that incorporates feature-guided position embedding for effective 2D-3D feature assignment.

This approach is characterized by a two-stage process: drafting and verification. The drafting stage generates draft tokens at a slightly lower quality but more quickly, which is achieved by selectively skipping certain intermediate layers during drafting. Subsequently, the verification stage employs the original LLM to validate those draft output tokens in one forward pass. This process ensures the final output remains identical to that produced by the unaltered LLM. Moreover, the proposed method requires no additional neural network training and no extra memory footprint, making it a plug-and-play and cost-effective solution for inference acceleration. Benchmarks with LLaMA-2 and its variants demonstrated a speedup up to 1.99$\times$.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |

In this paper, we proposed RapidIn, a scalable framework adapting to LLMs for estimating the influence of each training data. The proposed framework consists of two stages: caching and retrieval. First, we compress the gradient vectors by over 200,000x, allowing them to be cached on disk or in GPU/CPU memory. Then, given a generation, RapidIn efficiently traverses the cached gradients to estimate the influence within minutes, achieving over a 6,326x speedup. Moreover, RapidIn supports multi-GPU parallelization to substantially accelerate caching and retrieval. Our empirical result confirms the efficiency and effectiveness of RapidIn.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2024 |

However, gauging the trustworthiness of responses generated by LLMs remains an open challenge, with limited research on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for NLG. Furthermore, existing literature typically assumes white-box access to language models, which is becoming unrealistic either due to the closed-source nature of the latest LLMs or computational constraints. In this work, we investigate UQ in NLG for *black-box* LLMs. We first differentiate *uncertainty* vs *confidence*: the former refers to the ``dispersion'' of the potential predictions for a fixed input, and the latter refers to the confidence on a particular prediction/generation. We then propose and compare several confidence/uncertainty measures, applying them to *selective NLG* where unreliable results could either be ignored or yielded for further assessment. Experiments were carried out with several popular LLMs on question-answering datasets (for evaluation purposes). Results reveal that a simple measure for the semantic dispersion can be a reliable predictor of the quality of LLM responses, providing valuable insights for practitioners on uncertainty management when adopting LLMs. The code to replicate our experiments is available at https://github.com/zlin7/UQ-NLG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (05/2024)</p></details> |

Additionally, an auto-correct decoding algorithm facilitates the simultaneous generation and verification of token sequences within a single model invocation.

However, the application perspective of LLMs in real diagnostic scenarios is still unclear because they are not adept at collecting patient data proactively. This study presents a LLM-based diagnostic system that enhances planning capabilities by emulating doctors. Our system involves two external planners to handle planning tasks. The first planner employs a reinforcement learning approach to formulate disease screening questions and conduct initial diagnoses. The second planner uses LLMs to parse medical guidelines and conduct differential diagnoses. By utilizing real patient electronic medical record data, we constructed simulated dialogues between virtual patients and doctors and evaluated the diagnostic abilities of our system. We demonstrated that our system obtained impressive performance in both disease screening and differential diagnoses tasks. This research represents a step towards more seamlessly integrating AI into clinical settings, potentially enhancing the accuracy and accessibility of medical diagnostics.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[FlakyFix: Using Large Language Models for Predicting Flaky Test Fix Categories and Test Code Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00012v3)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flaky tests are problematic because they non-deterministically pass or fail for the same software version under test, causing confusion and wasting development effort. While machine learning models have been used to predict flakiness and its root causes, there is much less work on providing support to fix the problem. To address this gap, in this paper, we focus on predicting the type of fix that is required to remove flakiness and then repair the test code on that basis. We do this for a subset of flaky test cases where the root cause of flakiness is in the test case itself and not in the production code. Our key idea is to guide the repair process with additional knowledge about the test's flakiness in the form of its predicted fix category. Thus, we first propose a framework that automatically generates labeled datasets for 13 fix categories and trains models to predict the fix category of a flaky test by analyzing the test code only. Our experimental results using code models and few-shot learning show that we can correctly predict most of the fix categories. To show the usefulness of such fix category labels for automatically repairing flakiness, in addition to informing testers, we augment a Large Language Model (LLM) like GPT with such extra knowledge to ask the LLM for repair suggestions. The results show that our suggested fix category labels, complemented with in-context learning, significantly enhance the capability of GPT 3.5 Turbo in generating fixes for flaky tests. Based on the execution and analysis of a sample of GPT-repaired flaky tests, we estimate that a large percentage of such repairs, (roughly between 70% and 90%) can be expected to pass. For the failing repaired tests, on average, 16% of the test code needs to be further changed for them to pass.</p></details> | 25 pages, 19 Figures |

Further, we dig deep into the efficiency bottleneck of the training phase, and evaluate in detail the contribution of adaptive optimization algorithms (such as AdamW), massively parallel computing techniques, and mixed precision training strategies to accelerate convergence and reduce memory footprint. By analyzing the mathematical principles and implementation details of these algorithms, we reveal how they effectively improve training efficiency in practice. In terms of model deployment and inference optimization, this paper systematically reviews the latest advances in model compression techniques, focusing on strategies such as quantification, pruning, and knowledge distillation. By comparing the theoretical frameworks of these techniques and their effects in different application scenarios, we demonstrate their ability to significantly reduce model size and inference delay while maintaining model prediction accuracy. In addition, this paper critically examines the limitations of current efficiency optimization methods, such as the increased risk of overfitting, the control of performance loss after compression, and the problem of algorithm generality, and proposes some prospects for future research. In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding the efficiency optimization of large-scale language models.</p></details> |  |

Over time, information shared online has become more media-heavy and misinformation has readily adapted to these new modalities. The rise of generative AI-based tools, which provide widely-accessible methods for synthesizing realistic audio, images, video and human-like text, have amplified these concerns. Despite intense interest on the part of the public and significant press coverage, quantitative information on the prevalence and modality of media-based misinformation remains scarce. Here, we present the results of a two-year study using human raters to annotate online media-based misinformation, mostly focusing on images, based on claims assessed in a large sample of publicly-accessible fact checks with the ClaimReview markup. We present an image typology, designed to capture aspects of the image and manipulation relevant to the image's role in the misinformation claim. We visualize the distribution of these types over time. We show the the rise of generative AI-based content in misinformation claims, and that it's commonality is a relatively recent phenomenon, occurring significantly after heavy press coverage. We also show "simple" methods dominated historically, particularly context manipulations, and continued to hold a majority as of the end of data collection in November 2023. The dataset, Annotated Misinformation, Media-Based (AMMeBa), is publicly-available, and we hope that these data will serve as both a means of evaluating mitigation methods in a realistic setting and as a first-of-its-kind census of the types and modalities of online misinformation.</p></details> |  |

Several studies, however, indicate a lack of robustness of the models when dealing with complex linguistics and visual attributes. In this work, we introduce a novel V&L benchmark - ColorFoil, by creating color-related foils to assess the models' perception ability to detect colors like red, white, green, etc. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art V&L models including CLIP, ViLT, GroupViT, and BridgeTower, etc. in a zero-shot setting and present intriguing findings from the V&L models. The experimental evaluation indicates that ViLT and BridgeTower demonstrate much better color perception capabilities compared to CLIP and its variants and GroupViT. Moreover, CLIP-based models and GroupViT struggle to distinguish colors that are visually distinct to humans with normal color perception ability.</p></details> |  |

Ideally, a graph container enables efficient access to the underlying graph, has low space usage, and supports updating the graph efficiently. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of graph containers designed to support running algorithms on large graphs. To our knowledge, this is the first apples-to-apples comparison of graph containers rather than overall systems, which include confounding factors such as differences in algorithm implementations and infrastructure. We measure the running time of 10 highly-optimized algorithms across over 20 different containers and 10 graphs. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the average algorithm running time does not differ much across containers, especially those that support dynamic updates. Specifically, a simple container based on an off-the-shelf B-tree is only 1.22x slower on average than a highly optimized static one. Moreover, we observe that simplifying a graph-container Application Programming Interface (API) to only a few simple functions incurs a mere 1.16x slowdown compared to a complete API. Finally, we also measure batch-insert throughput in dynamic-graph containers for a full picture of their performance. To perform the benchmarks, we introduce BYO, a unified framework that standardizes evaluations of graph-algorithm performance across different graph containers.

We embark on an exploration of prompted LLMs within the context of educational and assessment applications to uncover their potential. Through a series of carefully crafted research questions, we investigate the effectiveness of prompt-based techniques in generating open-ended questions from school-level textbooks, assess their efficiency in generating open-ended questions from undergraduate-level technical textbooks, and explore the feasibility of employing a chain-of-thought inspired multi-stage prompting approach for language-agnostic multiple-choice question (MCQ) generation. Additionally, we evaluate the ability of prompted LLMs for language learning, exemplified through a case study in the low-resource Indian language Bengali, to explain Bengali grammatical errors. We also evaluate the potential of prompted LLMs to assess human resource (HR) spoken interview transcripts. By juxtaposing the capabilities of LLMs with those of human experts across various educational tasks and domains, our aim is to shed light on the potential and limitations of LLMs in reshaping educational practices.</p></details> | Accepted at EDM 2024 |

Though surprised by their excellent performances, researchers also noticed some special behaviors of those LLMs. One of those behaviors is memorization, in which LLMs can generate the same content used to train them. Though previous research has discussed memorization, the memorization of LLMs still lacks explanation, especially the cause of memorization and the dynamics of generating them. In this research, we comprehensively discussed memorization from various perspectives and extended the discussion scope to not only just the memorized content but also less and unmemorized content. Through various studies, we found that: (1) Through experiments, we revealed the relation of memorization between model size, continuation size, and context size. Further, we showed how unmemorized sentences transition to memorized sentences. (2) Through embedding analysis, we showed the distribution and decoding dynamics across model size in embedding space for sentences with different memorization scores. The n-gram statistics analysis presents d (3) An analysis over n-gram and entropy decoding dynamics discovered a boundary effect when the model starts to generate memorized sentences or unmemorized sentences. (4)We trained a Transformer model to predict the memorization of different models, showing that it is possible to predict memorizations by context.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic Invariant Robust Watermark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06356v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermark algorithms for large language models (LLMs) have achieved extremely high accuracy in detecting text generated by LLMs. Such algorithms typically involve adding extra watermark logits to the LLM's logits at each generation step. However, prior algorithms face a trade-off between attack robustness and security robustness. This is because the watermark logits for a token are determined by a certain number of preceding tokens; a small number leads to low security robustness, while a large number results in insufficient attack robustness. In this work, we propose a semantic invariant watermarking method for LLMs that provides both attack robustness and security robustness. The watermark logits in our work are determined by the semantics of all preceding tokens. Specifically, we utilize another embedding LLM to generate semantic embeddings for all preceding tokens, and then these semantic embeddings are transformed into the watermark logits through our trained watermark model. Subsequent analyses and experiments demonstrated the attack robustness of our method in semantically invariant settings: synonym substitution and text paraphrasing settings. Finally, we also show that our watermark possesses adequate security robustness. Our code and data are available at \href{https://github.com/THU-BPM/Robust_Watermark}{https://github.com/THU-BPM/Robust\_Watermark}.

However, current watermark detection algorithms require the secret key used in the watermark generation process, making them susceptible to security breaches and counterfeiting during public detection. To address this limitation, we propose an unforgeable publicly verifiable watermark algorithm named UPV that uses two different neural networks for watermark generation and detection, instead of using the same key at both stages. Meanwhile, the token embedding parameters are shared between the generation and detection networks, which makes the detection network achieve a high accuracy very efficiently. Experiments demonstrate that our algorithm attains high detection accuracy and computational efficiency through neural networks. Subsequent analysis confirms the high complexity involved in forging the watermark from the detection network.

To this end, this paper is the first to explore the potential of empowering MLLM to generate data rather than prompting GPT-4. We introduce Genixer, a holistic data generation pipeline consisting of four key steps: (i) instruction data collection, (ii) instruction template design, (iii) empowering MLLMs, and (iv) data generation and filtering. Additionally, we outline two modes of data generation: task-agnostic and task-specific, enabling controllable output. We demonstrate that a synthetic VQA-like dataset trained with LLaVA1.5 enhances performance on 10 out of 12 multimodal benchmarks. Additionally, the grounding MLLM Shikra, when trained with a REC-like synthetic dataset, shows improvements on 7 out of 8 REC datasets. Through experiments and synthetic data analysis, our findings are: (1) current MLLMs can serve as robust data generators without assistance from GPT-4V; (2) MLLMs trained with task-specific datasets can surpass GPT-4V in generating complex instruction tuning data; (3) synthetic datasets enhance performance across various multimodal benchmarks and help mitigate model hallucinations.

It then discusses the benefits of Human-Centered Design (HCD) principles and the possibility of their application within LLMs, subsequently deriving six specific HCD guidelines for LLMs. Following this, a preliminary experiment is presented as an example to demonstrate how HCD principles can be employed to enhance user experience within GPT by using a single document input to GPT's Knowledge base as a new knowledge resource to control the interactions between GPT and users, aiming to meet the diverse needs of hypothetical software learners as much as possible. The experimental results demonstrate the effect of different elements' forms and organizational methods in the document, as well as GPT's relevant configurations, on the interaction effectiveness between GPT and software learners. A series of trials are conducted to explore better methods to realize text and image displaying, and jump action. Two template documents are compared in the aspects of the performances of the four interaction modes. Through continuous optimization, an improved version of the document was obtained to serve as a template for future use and research.</p></details> |  |

We construct a benchmark, SafeEdit, which covers nine unsafe categories with various powerful attack prompts and equips comprehensive metrics for systematic evaluation. We conduct experiments with several knowledge editing approaches, indicating that knowledge editing has the potential to detoxify LLMs with a limited impact on general performance efficiently. Then, we propose a simple yet effective baseline, dubbed Detoxifying with Intraoperative Neural Monitoring (DINM), to diminish the toxicity of LLMs within a few tuning steps via only one instance. We further provide an in-depth analysis of the internal mechanism for various detoxifying approaches, demonstrating that previous methods like SFT and DPO may merely suppress the activations of toxic parameters, while DINM mitigates the toxicity of the toxic parameters to a certain extent, making permanent adjustments. We hope that these insights could shed light on future work of developing detoxifying approaches and the underlying knowledge mechanisms of LLMs. Code and benchmark are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024.

Assessing Re-Identification Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11103v2)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anonymity of both natural and legal persons in court rulings is a critical aspect of privacy protection in the European Union and Switzerland. With the advent of LLMs, concerns about large-scale re-identification of anonymized persons are growing. In accordance with the Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland, we explore the potential of LLMs to re-identify individuals in court rulings by constructing a proof-of-concept using actual legal data from the Swiss federal supreme court. Following the initial experiment, we constructed an anonymized Wikipedia dataset as a more rigorous testing ground to further investigate the findings. With the introduction and application of the new task of re-identifying people in texts, we also introduce new metrics to measure performance. We systematically analyze the factors that influence successful re-identifications, identifying model size, input length, and instruction tuning among the most critical determinants. Despite high re-identification rates on Wikipedia, even the best LLMs struggled with court decisions. The complexity is attributed to the lack of test datasets, the necessity for substantial training resources, and data sparsity in the information used for re-identification. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that re-identification using LLMs may not be feasible for now, but as the proof-of-concept on Wikipedia showed, it might become possible in the future. We hope that our system can help enhance the confidence in the security of anonymized decisions, thus leading to the courts being more confident to publish decisions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL Findings 2024</p></details> |

For the Bayesian linear inverse problems with Gaussian noise and Gaussian prior, we propose a new iterative regularization algorithm that belongs to subspace projection regularization (SPR) methods. By treating the forward model matrix as a linear operator between the two underlying finite dimensional Hilbert spaces with new introduced inner products, we first introduce an iterative process that can generate a series of valid solution subspaces. The SPR method then projects the original problem onto these solution subspaces to get a series of low dimensional linear least squares problems, where an efficient procedure is developed to update the solutions of them to approximate the desired solution of the original problem. With the new designed early stopping rules, this iterative algorithm can obtain a regularized solution with a satisfied accuracy. Several theoretical results about the algorithm are established to reveal the regularization properties of it. We use both small-scale and large-scale inverse problems to test the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its robustness and efficiency. The most computationally intensive operations in the proposed algorithm only involve matrix-vector products, making it highly efficient for large-scale problems.</p></details> |  |

Backdoor attacks involve the insertion of triggers into training data, allowing attackers to manipulate the behavior of the model maliciously. In this paper, we focus on analyzing the model parameters to detect potential backdoor signals in code models. Specifically, we examine attention weights and biases, and context embeddings of the clean and poisoned CodeBERT and CodeT5 models. Our results suggest noticeable patterns in context embeddings of poisoned samples for both the poisoned models; however, attention weights and biases do not show any significant differences.

We show that it is relatively straightforward to contextualize an LLM so it can generate domain-specific plans. However, these plans may be infeasible for the physical system to execute or the plan may be unsafe for human users. To address this, we propose CPS-LLM, an LLM retrained using an instruction tuning framework, which ensures that generated plans not only align with the physical system dynamics of the CPS but are also safe for human users. The CPS-LLM consists of two innovative components: a) a liquid time constant neural network-based physical dynamics coefficient estimator that can derive coefficients of dynamical models with some unmeasured state variables; b) the model coefficients are then used to train an LLM with prompts embodied with traces from the dynamical system and the corresponding model coefficients. We show that when the CPS-LLM is integrated with a contextualized chatbot such as BARD it can generate feasible and safe plans to manage external events such as meals for automated insulin delivery systems used by Type 1 Diabetes subjects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in AAAI 2024, Planning for Cyber Physical Systems</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce EmbSum, a novel framework that enables offline pre-computations of users and candidate items while capturing the interactions within the user engagement history. By utilizing the pretrained encoder-decoder model and poly-attention layers, EmbSum derives User Poly-Embedding (UPE) and Content Poly-Embedding (CPE) to calculate relevance scores between users and candidate items. EmbSum actively learns the long user engagement histories by generating user-interest summary with supervision from large language model (LLM). The effectiveness of EmbSum is validated on two datasets from different domains, surpassing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods with higher accuracy and fewer parameters. Additionally, the model's ability to generate summaries of user interests serves as a valuable by-product, enhancing its usefulness for personalized content recommendations.</p></details> | Under review |

Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models are Biased Reinforcement Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11422v1)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning enables large language models (LLMs) to perform a variety of tasks, including learning to make reward-maximizing choices in simple bandit tasks. Given their potential use as (autonomous) decision-making agents, it is important to understand how these models perform such reinforcement learning (RL) tasks and the extent to which they are susceptible to biases. Motivated by the fact that, in humans, it has been widely documented that the value of an outcome depends on how it compares to other local outcomes, the present study focuses on whether similar value encoding biases apply to how LLMs encode rewarding outcomes. Results from experiments with multiple bandit tasks and models show that LLMs exhibit behavioral signatures of a relative value bias. Adding explicit outcome comparisons to the prompt produces opposing effects on performance, enhancing maximization in trained choice sets but impairing generalization to new choice sets. Computational cognitive modeling reveals that LLM behavior is well-described by a simple RL algorithm that incorporates relative values at the outcome encoding stage. Lastly, we present preliminary evidence that the observed biases are not limited to fine-tuned LLMs, and that relative value processing is detectable in the final hidden layer activations of a raw, pretrained model. These findings have important implications for the use of LLMs in decision-making applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Opportunistically Parallel Lambda Calculus for Performant Composition of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11361v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive results at a wide-range of tasks. However, they have limitations, such as hallucinating facts and struggling with arithmetic. Recent work has addressed these issues with sophisticated decoding techniques. However, performant decoding, particularly for sophisticated techniques, relies crucially on parallelization and batching, which are difficult for developers. We make two observations: 1) existing approaches are high-level domain-specific languages for gluing expensive black-box calls, but are not general or compositional; 2) LLM programs are essentially pure (all effects commute). Guided by these observations, we develop a novel, general-purpose lambda calculus for automatically parallelizing a wide-range of LLM interactions, without user intervention. The key difference versus standard lambda calculus is a novel "opportunistic" evaluation strategy, which steps independent parts of a program in parallel, dispatching black-box external calls as eagerly as possible, even while data-independent parts of the program are waiting for their own external calls to return. To maintain the simplicity of the language and to ensure uniformity of opportunistic evaluation, control-flow and looping constructs are implemented in-language, via Church encodings. We implement this approach in a framework called EPIC, embedded in--and interoperating closely with--Python. We demonstrate its versatility and performance with three case studies drawn from the machine learning literature: Tree-of-Thoughts (LLMs embedded in classic search procedures), nested tool use, and constrained decoding. Our experiments show that opportunistic evaluation offers a $1.5\times$ to $4.8\times$ speedup over sequential evaluation, while still allowing practitioners to write straightforward and composable programs, without any manual parallelism or batching.</p></details> |  |

Yet, LLMs' successes have been largely restricted to tasks concerning words, sentences, or documents, and it remains questionable how much they understand the minimal units of text, namely characters. In this paper, we examine contemporary LLMs regarding their ability to understand character composition of words, and show that most of them fail to reliably carry out even the simple tasks that can be handled by humans with perfection. We analyze their behaviors with comparison to token level performances, and discuss the potential directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we propose LLM Discussion, a three-phase discussion framework that facilitates vigorous and diverging idea exchanges and ensures convergence to creative answers. Moreover, we adopt a role-playing technique by assigning distinct roles to LLMs to combat the homogeneity of LLMs. We evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework with the Alternative Uses Test, Similarities Test, Instances Test, and Scientific Creativity Test through both LLM evaluation and human study.

Due to the variability of neighborhoods, LNPS allows for flexible search without strongly depending on the destroy operators. We present an implementation of LNPS based on ASP. The resulting heulingo solver demonstrates that LNPS can significantly enhance the solving performance of ASP for optimization. Furthermore, we establish the competitiveness of our LNPS approach by empirically contrasting it to (adaptive) large neighborhood search.</p></details> | 11 pages |

An important task for these databases is automatically extracting structured information mentioned in the report, e.g., the affected software packages, to accelerate the defense of the vulnerability ecosystem. However, it is challenging for existing work on affected package identification to achieve a high accuracy. One reason is that all existing work focuses on relatively smaller models, thus they cannot harness the knowledge and semantic capabilities of large language models. To address this limitation, we propose VulLibGen, the first method to use LLM for affected package identification. In contrast to existing work, VulLibGen proposes the novel idea to directly generate the affected package. To improve the accuracy, VulLibGen employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT), retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and a local search algorithm. The local search algorithm is a novel postprocessing algorithm we introduce for reducing the hallucination of the generated packages. Our evaluation results show that VulLibGen has an average accuracy of 0.806 for identifying vulnerable packages in the four most popular ecosystems in GitHub Advisory (Java, JS, Python, Go) while the best average accuracy in previous work is 0.721. Additionally, VulLibGen has high value to security practice: we submitted 60 <vulnerability, affected package> pairs to GitHub Advisory (covers four ecosystems). 34 of them have been accepted and merged and 20 are pending approval.

Many existing LLMs are safe fine-tuned either with safety demonstrations, or rely only on adversarial testing. While able to get safe outputs, they often risk losing contextual meaning as they mitigate bias and toxicity. In response, we present MBIAS, a LLM framework instruction fine-tuned on a custom dataset specifically designed for safety interventions. MBIAS aims to address the significant issues of bias and toxicity in LLMs generations that typically manifest as underrepresentation or negative portrayals across various demographics, including inappropriate linguistic mentions and biased content in social media. We experiment on MBIAS for safety interventions using various configurations, and demonstrate more than a 30\% reduction in overall bias and toxicity while successfully retaining key information. Additionally, a demographic analysis on an out-of-distribution test set confirms the robustness of our approach, with reductions in bias and toxicity exceeding 90\% across various demographics. The dataset and instruction fine-tuned MBIAS are made available to the research community at https://huggingface.co/newsmediabias/MBIAS.</p></details> |  |

We propose EnviroExam, a comprehensive evaluation method designed to assess the knowledge of large language models in the field of environmental science. EnviroExam is based on the curricula of top international universities, covering undergraduate, master's, and doctoral courses, and includes 936 questions across 42 core courses. By conducting 0-shot and 5-shot tests on 31 open-source large language models, EnviroExam reveals the performance differences among these models in the domain of environmental science and provides detailed evaluation standards. The results show that 61.3% of the models passed the 5-shot tests, while 48.39% passed the 0-shot tests. By introducing the coefficient of variation as an indicator, we evaluate the performance of mainstream open-source large language models in environmental science from multiple perspectives, providing effective criteria for selecting and fine-tuning language models in this field. Future research will involve constructing more domain-specific test sets using specialized environmental science textbooks to further enhance the accuracy and specificity of the evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Is The Best: Model-Agnostic Code Simplification for Pre-trained Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11196v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Large Language Models (LLM) have achieved remarkable successes in several domains. However, code-oriented LLMs are heavy in computational complexity, and quadratically with the length of the input. Toward simplifying the input program of an LLM, the state-of-the-art approach has the strategies to filter the input code tokens based on the attention scores given by the LLM. The decision to simplify the input should not rely on the attention patterns of an LLM, as these patterns are influenced by both the model architecture and the pre-training dataset. Since the model and dataset are part of the solution domain, not the problem domain where the input belongs, the outcome may differ when the model is pre-trained on a different dataset. We propose SlimCode, a model-agnostic code simplification solution for LLMs that depends on the nature of input code tokens. As an empirical study on the LLMs including CodeBERT, CodeT5, and GPT-4 for two main tasks: code search and summarization, we reported that 1) the removal ratio of code has a linear-like relation with the saving ratio on training time, 2) the impact of categorized tokens on code simplification can vary significantly, 3) the impact of categorized tokens on code simplification is task-specific but model-agnostic, and 4) the above findings hold for the paradigm-prompt engineering and interactive in-context learning. The empirical results showed that SlimCode can improve the state-of-the-art technique by 9.46% and 5.15% in terms of MRR and BLEU score on code search and summarization. Moreover, SlimCode is 133 times faster than the state-of-the-art approach. Additionally, SlimCode can reduce the cost of invoking GPT-4 by up to 24% per API query, while still producing comparable results to those with the original code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automating PTSD Diagnostics in Clinical Interviews: Leveraging Large Language Models for Trauma Assessments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11178v1)** | 2024-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The shortage of clinical workforce presents significant challenges in mental healthcare, limiting access to formal diagnostics and services. We aim to tackle this shortage by integrating a customized large language model (LLM) into the workflow, thus promoting equity in mental healthcare for the general population. Although LLMs have showcased their capability in clinical decision-making, their adaptation to severe conditions like Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we collect 411 clinician-administered diagnostic interviews and devise a novel approach to obtain high-quality data. Moreover, we build a comprehensive framework to automate PTSD diagnostic assessments based on interview contents by leveraging two state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Llama-2, with potential for broader clinical diagnoses. Our results illustrate strong promise for LLMs, tested on our dataset, to aid clinicians in diagnostic validation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first AI system that fully automates assessments for mental illness based on clinician-administered interviews.</p></details> |  |

With the advancements in large language models, these systems have become more adept at translating complex questions into SQL queries. Nonetheless, the critical need for reliability in healthcare necessitates these models to accurately identify unanswerable questions or uncertain predictions, preventing misinformation. To address this problem, we present a self-training strategy using pseudo-labeled unanswerable questions to enhance the reliability of text-to-SQL models for EHRs. This approach includes a two-stage training process followed by a filtering method based on the token entropy and query execution. Our methodology's effectiveness is validated by our top performance in the EHRSQL 2024 shared task, showcasing the potential to improve healthcare decision-making through more reliable text-to-SQL systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024 Clinical NLP Workshop</p></details> |

Yet, the realization of such benefits often results in ineffective GPU memory utilization, as large portions of the model parameters remain dormant during inference. Moreover, the memory demands of large models consistently outpace the memory capacity of contemporary GPUs. Addressing this, we introduce SiDA-MoE ($\textbf{S}$parsity-$\textbf{i}$nspired $\textbf{D}$ata-$\textbf{A}$ware), an efficient inference approach tailored for large MoE models. SiDA-MoE judiciously exploits both the system's main memory, which is now abundant and readily scalable, and GPU memory by capitalizing on the inherent sparsity on expert activation in MoE models. By adopting a data-aware perspective, SiDA-MoE achieves enhanced model efficiency with a neglectable performance drop. Specifically, SiDA-MoE attains a remarkable speedup in MoE inference with up to $3.93\times$ throughput increasing, up to $72\%$ latency reduction, and up to $80\%$ GPU memory saving with down to $1\%$ performance drop. This work paves the way for scalable and efficient deployment of large MoE models, even with constrained resources.

A Study Based on Moral Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11100v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have taken centre stage in debates on Artificial Intelligence. Yet there remains a gap in how to assess LLMs' conformity to important human values. In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 (Gemini Pro and LLAMA 2 did not generate valid results) are moral hypocrites. We employ two research instruments based on the Moral Foundations Theory: (i) the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), which investigates which values are considered morally relevant in abstract moral judgements; and (ii) the Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs), which evaluate moral cognition in concrete scenarios related to each moral foundation. We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy. We found that both models displayed reasonable consistency within each instrument compared to humans, but they displayed contradictory and hypocritical behaviour when we compared the abstract values present in the MFQ to the evaluation of concrete moral violations of the MFV.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This is especially relevant considering the substantial evidence that LLMs can replicate human social biases in their text outputs and further influence stakeholders, potentially amplifying harm to already marginalized individuals and communities. Therefore, recent efforts in bias detection invested in automated benchmarks and objective metrics such as accuracy (i.e., an LLMs output is compared against a predefined ground truth). Nonetheless, social biases can be nuanced, oftentimes subjective and context-dependent, where a situation is open to interpretation and there is no ground truth. While these situations can be difficult for automated evaluation systems to identify, human evaluators could potentially pick up on these nuances. In this paper, we discuss the role of human evaluation and subjective interpretation to augment automated processes when identifying biases in LLMs as part of a human-centred approach to evaluate these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>HEAL ...</summary><p>HEAL Workshop at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, May 12, 2024, Honolulu, HI, USA</p></details> |

This study introduces ARCoT (Adaptable Retrieval-based Chain of Thought), a framework designed to enhance the domain-specific accuracy of LLMs without requiring fine-tuning or extensive retraining. ARCoT integrates a retrieval mechanism to access relevant domain-specific information and employs step-back and chain-of-thought prompting techniques to guide the LLM's reasoning process, ensuring more accurate and context-aware responses. Benchmarking on a medical physics multiple-choice exam, our model outperformed standard LLMs and reported average human performance, demonstrating improvements of up to 68% and achieving a high score of 90%. This method reduces hallucinations and increases domain-specific performance. The versatility and model-agnostic nature of ARCoT make it easily adaptable to various domains, showcasing its significant potential for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in specialized fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

To mitigate potential discrimination and enhance the overall usability and accessibility for diverse language user groups, it is important for the development of language-fair technology. Despite the breakthroughs of LLMs, the investigation into the multilingual scenario remains insufficient, where a comprehensive survey to summarize recent approaches, developments, limitations, and potential solutions is desirable. To this end, we provide a survey with multiple perspectives on the utilization of LLMs in the multilingual scenario. We first rethink the transitions between previous and current research on pre-trained language models. Then we introduce several perspectives on the multilingualism of LLMs, including training and inference methods, model security, multi-domain with language culture, and usage of datasets. We also discuss the major challenges that arise in these aspects, along with possible solutions. Besides, we highlight future research directions that aim at further enhancing LLMs with multilingualism. The survey aims to help the research community address multilingual problems and provide a comprehensive understanding of the core concepts, key techniques, and latest developments in multilingual natural language processing based on LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, Work in Progress</p></details> |

We find that VLMs and LLMs-based decision pipelines are good at different kinds of VCR problems. Pre-trained VLMs exhibit strong performance for problems involving understanding the literal visual content, which we noted as visual commonsense understanding (VCU). For problems where the goal is to infer conclusions beyond image content, which we noted as visual commonsense inference (VCI), VLMs face difficulties, while LLMs, given sufficient visual evidence, can use commonsense to infer the answer well. We empirically validate this by letting LLMs classify VCR problems into these two categories and show the significant difference between VLM and LLM with image caption decision pipelines on two subproblems. Moreover, we identify a challenge with VLMs' passive perception, which may miss crucial context information, leading to incorrect reasoning by LLMs. Based on these, we suggest a collaborative approach, named ViCor, where pre-trained LLMs serve as problem classifiers to analyze the problem category, then either use VLMs to answer the question directly or actively instruct VLMs to concentrate on and gather relevant visual elements to support potential commonsense inferences. We evaluate our framework on two VCR benchmark datasets and outperform all other methods that do not require in-domain fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

Based on the Counting-Stars test, we conduct experiments to evaluate long-context LLMs (i.e., GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Claude3 Opus, GLM-4, and Moonshot-v1). Experimental results demonstrate that Gemini 1.5 Pro achieves the best overall results, while the performance of GPT-4 Turbo is the most stable across various tasks. Furthermore, our analysis of these LLMs, which are extended to handle long-context scenarios, indicates that there is potential for improvement as the length of the input context and the intricacy of the tasks are increasing.</p></details> | work in progress |

In this technical paper, we outline Cognitive Network Evaluation Toolkit for Medical Domains (COGNET-MD), which constitutes a novel benchmark for LLM evaluation in the medical domain. Specifically, we propose a scoring-framework with increased difficulty to assess the ability of LLMs in interpreting medical text. The proposed framework is accompanied with a database of Multiple Choice Quizzes (MCQs). To ensure alignment with current medical trends and enhance safety, usefulness, and applicability, these MCQs have been constructed in collaboration with several associated medical experts in various medical domains and are characterized by varying degrees of difficulty. The current (first) version of the database includes the medical domains of Psychiatry, Dentistry, Pulmonology, Dermatology and Endocrinology, but it will be continuously extended and expanded to include additional medical domains.</p></details> | Technical Paper |

However, effectively analyzing this vast amount of data poses a significant challenge. Astronomers are turning to deep learning techniques to address this, but the methods are limited by their specific training sets, leading to considerable duplicate workloads too. Hence, as an example to present how to overcome the issue, we built a framework for general analysis of galaxy images, based on a large vision model (LVM) plus downstream tasks (DST), including galaxy morphological classification, image restoration, object detection, parameter extraction, and more. Considering the low signal-to-noise ratio of galaxy images and the imbalanced distribution of galaxy categories, we have incorporated a Human-in-the-loop (HITL) module into our large vision model, which leverages human knowledge to enhance the reliability and interpretability of processing galaxy images interactively. The proposed framework exhibits notable few-shot learning capabilities and versatile adaptability to all the abovementioned tasks on galaxy images in the DESI legacy imaging surveys. Expressly, for object detection, trained by 1000 data points, our DST upon the LVM achieves an accuracy of 96.7%, while ResNet50 plus Mask R-CNN gives an accuracy of 93.1%; for morphology classification, to obtain AUC ~0.9, LVM plus DST and HITL only requests 1/50 training sets compared to ResNet18. Expectedly, multimodal data can be integrated similarly, which opens up possibilities for conducting joint analyses with datasets spanning diverse domains in the era of multi-message astronomy.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 10 figures, to be published on Chinese Physics C</p></details> |

As established scaling laws indicate, LLMs' future performance improvement depends on the amount of computing and data sources we can leverage for pre-training. Federated learning (FL) has the potential to unleash the majority of the planet's data and computational resources, which are underutilized by the data-center-focused training methodology of current LLM practice. Our work presents a robust, flexible, reproducible FL approach that enables large-scale collaboration across institutions to train LLMs. This would mobilize more computational and data resources while matching or potentially exceeding centralized performance. We further show the effectiveness of the federated training scales with model size and present our approach for training a billion-scale federated LLM using limited resources. This will help data-rich actors to become the protagonists of LLMs pre-training instead of leaving the stage to compute-rich actors alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, pre-print</p></details> |

By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice. Lastly, we outline recommendations for future works on the topic aimed at better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the SFM+LLM solutions for ST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |

The advancement of LLM techniques also offers promising opportunities to automate many tasks in the telecommunication (telecom) field. After pre-training and fine-tuning, LLMs can perform diverse downstream tasks based on human instructions, paving the way to artificial general intelligence (AGI)-enabled 6G. Given the great potential of LLM technologies, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview of LLM-enabled telecom networks. In particular, we first present LLM fundamentals, including model architecture, pre-training, fine-tuning, inference and utilization, model evaluation, and telecom deployment. Then, we introduce LLM-enabled key techniques and telecom applications in terms of generation, classification, optimization, and prediction problems. Specifically, the LLM-enabled generation applications include telecom domain knowledge, code, and network configuration generation. After that, the LLM-based classification applications involve network security, text, image, and traffic classification problems. Moreover, multiple LLM-enabled optimization techniques are introduced, such as automated reward function design for reinforcement learning and verbal reinforcement learning. Furthermore, for LLM-aided prediction problems, we discussed time-series prediction models and multi-modality prediction problems for telecom. Finally, we highlight the challenges and identify the future directions of LLM-enabled telecom networks.</p></details> |  |

However, many active learning strategies struggle with a 'cold start' problem, needing substantial initial data to be effective. This limitation often reduces their utility for pre-trained models, which already perform well in few-shot scenarios. To address this, we introduce ActiveLLM, a novel active learning approach that leverages large language models such as GPT-4, Llama 3, and Mistral Large for selecting instances. We demonstrate that ActiveLLM significantly enhances the classification performance of BERT classifiers in few-shot scenarios, outperforming both traditional active learning methods and the few-shot learning method SetFit. Additionally, ActiveLLM can be extended to non-few-shot scenarios, allowing for iterative selections. In this way, ActiveLLM can even help other active learning strategies to overcome their cold start problem. Our results suggest that ActiveLLM offers a promising solution for improving model performance across various learning setups.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

The prognosis of leukemia is challenging without the morphological information of White Blood Cells (WBC) and relies on the accessibility of expensive microscopes and the availability of hematologists to analyze Peripheral Blood Samples (PBS). Deep Learning based methods can be employed to assist hematologists. However, these algorithms require a large amount of labeled data, which is not readily available. To overcome this limitation, we have acquired a realistic, generalized, and large dataset. To collect this comprehensive dataset for real-world applications, two microscopes from two different cost spectrums (high-cost HCM and low-cost LCM) are used for dataset capturing at three magnifications (100x, 40x, 10x) through different sensors (high-end camera for HCM, middle-level camera for LCM and mobile-phone camera for both). The high-sensor camera is 47 times more expensive than the middle-level camera and HCM is 17 times more expensive than LCM. In this collection, using HCM at high resolution (100x), experienced hematologists annotated 10.3k WBC types (14) and artifacts, having 55k morphological labels (Cell Size, Nuclear Chromatin, Nuclear Shape, etc.) from 2.4k images of several PBS leukemia patients. Later on, these annotations are transferred to other 2 magnifications of HCM, and 3 magnifications of LCM, and on each camera captured images. Along with the LeukemiaAttri dataset, we provide baselines over multiple object detectors and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) strategies, along with morphological information-based attribute prediction. The dataset will be publicly available after publication to facilitate the research in this direction.</p></details> | Early Accept |

Results are derived under a minimal set of assumptions and, in particular, we require only the existence of 4th order moments. A special focus is given to the time series setting, a case considered in almost all recent econometric applications of factor models. Hence, estimation is based on the classical $n\times n$ sample covariance matrix and not on a $T\times T$ covariance matrix often considered in the literature. Indeed, despite the two approaches being asymptotically equivalent, the former is more coherent with a time series setting and it immediately allows us to write more intuitive asymptotic expansions for the Principal Component estimators showing that they are equivalent to OLS as long as $\sqrt n/T\to 0$ and $\sqrt T/n\to 0$, that is the loadings are estimated in a time series regression as if the factors were known, while the factors are estimated in a cross-sectional regression as if the loadings were known. Finally, we give some alternative sets of primitive sufficient conditions for mean-squared consistency of the sample covariance matrix of the factors, of the idiosyncratic components, and of the observed time series, which is the starting point for Principal Component Analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2211.01921 which is written by the same author.

In addition to the large number of parameters, the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in the transformer architecture consumes a significant amount of memory, especially when the number of layers is large for deep language models. In this paper, we propose a novel method that only computes and caches the KVs of a small number of layers, thus significantly saving memory consumption and improving inference throughput. Our experiments on large language models show that our method achieves up to 26$\times$ higher throughput than standard transformers and competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. In addition, our method is orthogonal to existing transformer memory-saving techniques, so it is straightforward to integrate them with our model, achieving further improvement in inference efficiency.

However, training LLMs for languages other than English poses significant challenges, due to the difficulty in acquiring large-scale corpus and the requisite computing resources. In this paper, we propose ChatFlow, a cross-language transfer-based LLM, to address these challenges and train large Chinese language models in a cost-effective manner. We employ a mix of Chinese, English, and parallel corpus to continuously train the LLaMA2 model, aiming to align cross-language representations and facilitate the knowledge transfer specifically to the Chinese language model. In addition, we use a dynamic data sampler to progressively transition the model from unsupervised pre-training to supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach accelerates model convergence and achieves superior performance.

Still, their growing scale has increased the computational burden, necessitating a balance between efficiency and performance. Low-rank compression, a promising technique, reduces non-essential parameters by decomposing weight matrices into products of two low-rank matrices. Yet, its application in LLMs has not been extensively studied. The key to low-rank compression lies in low-rank factorization and low-rank dimensions allocation. To address the challenges of low-rank compression in LLMs, we conduct empirical research on the low-rank characteristics of large models. We propose a low-rank compression method suitable for LLMs. This approach involves precise estimation of feature distributions through pooled covariance matrices and a Bayesian optimization strategy for allocating low-rank dimensions. Experiments on the LLaMA-2 models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing strong structured pruning and low-rank compression techniques in maintaining model performance at the same compression ratio.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 ACL findings</p></details> |

The aim of this study is to place all these developments in a pragmatic broader historical social perspective without any exaggerations while at the same time without any pessimism that created the AI winter in the 1970s to 1990s. We also at the same time point out toxicity, bias, memorization, sycophancy, logical inconsistencies, hallucinations that exist just as a warning to the overly optimistic. We note here that just as this emergence of AI seems to occur at a threshold point in the number of neural connections or weights, it has also been observed that human brain and especially the cortex region is nothing special or extraordinary but simply a case of scaled-up version of the primate brain and that even the human intelligence seems like an emergent phenomena of scale.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods have explored utilizing LLMs as data annotators to generate synthesized data for training contrastive learning based sentence embedding models such as SimCSE. However, since contrastive learning models are sensitive to the quality of sentence pairs, the effectiveness of these methods is largely influenced by the content generated from LLMs, highlighting the need for more refined generation in the context of sentence representation learning. Building upon this premise, we propose MultiCSR, a multi-level contrastive sentence representation learning framework that decomposes the process of prompting LLMs to generate a corpus for training base sentence embedding models into three stages (i.e., sentence generation, sentence pair construction, in-batch training) and refines the generated content at these three distinct stages, ensuring only high-quality sentence pairs are utilized to train a base contrastive learning model. Our extensive experiments reveal that MultiCSR enables a less advanced LLM to surpass the performance of ChatGPT, while applying it to ChatGPT achieves better state-of-the-art results. Comprehensive analyses further underscore the potential of our framework in various application scenarios and achieving better sentence representation learning with LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2024 |

However, the proliferation of FMs brings forth a critical challenge: the potential to generate hallucinated outputs, particularly in high-stakes applications. The tendency of foundation models to produce hallucinated content arguably represents the biggest hindrance to their widespread adoption in real-world scenarios, especially in domains where reliability and accuracy are paramount. This survey paper presents a comprehensive overview of recent developments that aim to identify and mitigate the problem of hallucination in FMs, spanning text, image, video, and audio modalities. By synthesizing recent advancements in detecting and mitigating hallucination across various modalities, the paper aims to provide valuable insights for researchers, developers, and practitioners. Essentially, it establishes a clear framework encompassing definition, taxonomy, and detection strategies for addressing hallucination in multimodal foundation models, laying the foundation for future research in this pivotal area.</p></details> |  |

The learning process is usually based on data-driven paradigm without prior knowledge, resulting in poor transferability and generalizability. To address this issue, we propose MM-Retinal, a multi-modal dataset that encompasses high-quality image-text pairs collected from professional fundus diagram books. Moreover, enabled by MM-Retinal, we present a novel Knowledge-enhanced foundational pretraining model which incorporates Fundus Image-Text expertise, called KeepFIT. It is designed with image similarity-guided text revision and mixed training strategy to infuse expert knowledge. Our proposed fundus foundation model achieves state-of-the-art performance across six unseen downstream tasks and holds excellent generalization ability in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. MM-Retinal and KeepFIT are available at https://github.com/lxirich/MM-Retinal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Early...</summary><p>Early Accepted by The International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention(MICCAI)2024</p></details> |

However, practitioners often encounter challenges when attempting to deploy these methods due to their subpar performance. In this paper, we present a novel SSL approach named FineSSL that significantly addresses this limitation by adapting pre-trained foundation models. We identify the aggregated biases and cognitive deviation problems inherent in foundation models, and propose a simple yet effective solution by imposing balanced margin softmax and decoupled label smoothing. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FineSSL sets a new state of the art for SSL on multiple benchmark datasets, reduces the training cost by over six times, and can seamlessly integrate various fine-tuning and modern SSL algorithms.

| **[Foundation Model for Chemical Process Modeling: Meta-Learning with Physics-Informed Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11752v1)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a novel application of foundation models in the domain of nonlinear chemical process modeling. Given the challenges of obtaining accurate first-principles models for real-world chemical processes and the inefficiency of rebuilding and retraining models for new chemical processes, we pose a pivotal question: What if we could develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., foundation model) capable of rapidly adapting to modeling any new chemical process? To address this question, we propose a meta-learning-based approach using Reptile to construct the foundation model, followed by physics-informed adaptation to fine-tune it to new modeling tasks using only a few data samples. To assess the effectiveness of our methodology, we construct a foundation model for various chemical reactions in three classical generic reactors, including continuous stirred tank reactors (CSTRs), batch reactors (BRs), and plug flow reactors (PFRs). Our approach outperforms conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and pure meta-learning in a few-shot setting. Furthermore, our method achieves rapid adaptation to new CSTRs, BRs, and PFRs using only a few data samples from the designated tasks.

| **[Advancing Human Action Recognition with Foundation Models trained on Unlabeled Public Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08875v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing variety and quantity of tagged multimedia content on platforms such as TikTok provides an opportunity to advance computer vision modeling. We have curated a distinctive dataset of 283,582 unique video clips categorized under 386 hashtags relating to modern human actions. We release this dataset as a valuable resource for building domain-specific foundation models for human movement modeling tasks such as action recognition. To validate this dataset, which we name TikTokActions, we perform two sets of experiments. First, we pretrain the state-of-the-art VideoMAEv2 with a ViT-base backbone on TikTokActions subset, and then fine-tune and evaluate on popular datasets such as UCF101 and the HMDB51. We find that the performance of the model pre-trained using our Tik-Tok dataset is comparable to models trained on larger action recognition datasets (95.3% on UCF101 and 53.24% on HMDB51). Furthermore, our investigation into the relationship between pre-training dataset size and fine-tuning performance reveals that beyond a certain threshold, the incremental benefit of larger training sets diminishes. This work introduces a useful TikTok video dataset that is available for public use and provides insights into the marginal benefit of increasing pre-training dataset sizes for video-based foundation models.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, existing AI models in this domain often require extensive annotation and are task-specific, limiting their clinical utility. While recent developments have brought about foundation models for ophthalmology, they are limited by the need to train separate weights for each imaging modality, preventing a comprehensive representation of multi-modal features. This highlights the need for versatile foundation models capable of handling various tasks and modalities in ophthalmology. To address this gap, we present EyeFound, a multimodal foundation model for ophthalmic images. Unlike existing models, EyeFound learns generalizable representations from unlabeled multimodal retinal images, enabling efficient model adaptation across multiple applications. Trained on 2.78 million images from 227 hospitals across 11 ophthalmic modalities, EyeFound facilitates generalist representations and diverse multimodal downstream tasks, even for detecting challenging rare diseases. It outperforms previous work RETFound in diagnosing eye diseases, predicting systemic disease incidents, and zero-shot multimodal VQA. EyeFound provides a generalizable solution to improve model performance and lessen the annotation burden on experts, facilitating widespread clinical AI applications from retinal imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Addressing this challenge, we introduce an algorithm designed to achieve accurate self-supervised stereo depth estimation focusing on nighttime conditions. Specifically, we use pretrained visual foundation models to extract generalised features across challenging scenes and present an efficient method for matching and integrating these features from stereo frames. Moreover, to prevent pixels violating photometric consistency assumption from negatively affecting the depth predictions, we propose a novel masking approach designed to filter out such pixels. Lastly, addressing weaknesses in the evaluation of current depth estimation algorithms, we present novel evaluation metrics. Our experiments, conducted on challenging datasets including Oxford RobotCar and Multi-Spectral Stereo, demonstrate the robust improvements realized by our approach.

A Study Based on Moral Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11100v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have taken centre stage in debates on Artificial Intelligence. Yet there remains a gap in how to assess LLMs' conformity to important human values. In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 (Gemini Pro and LLAMA 2 did not generate valid results) are moral hypocrites. We employ two research instruments based on the Moral Foundations Theory: (i) the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), which investigates which values are considered morally relevant in abstract moral judgements; and (ii) the Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs), which evaluate moral cognition in concrete scenarios related to each moral foundation. We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy. We found that both models displayed reasonable consistency within each instrument compared to humans, but they displayed contradictory and hypocritical behaviour when we compared the abstract values present in the MFQ to the evaluation of concrete moral violations of the MFV.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This paradigm has extended to other modalities, including speech, where researchers are actively exploring the combination of Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) and LLMs into single, unified models capable of addressing multimodal tasks. Among such tasks, this paper focuses on speech-to-text translation (ST). By examining the published papers on the topic, we propose a unified view of the architectural solutions and training strategies presented so far, highlighting similarities and differences among them. Based on this examination, we not only organize the lessons learned but also show how diverse settings and evaluation approaches hinder the identification of the best-performing solution for each architectural building block and training choice. Lastly, we outline recommendations for future works on the topic aimed at better understanding the strengths and weaknesses of the SFM+LLM solutions for ST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACL 2024 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Prospective Role of Foundation Models in Advancing Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02288v2)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of artificial intelligence and breakthroughs in deep learning, large-scale Foundation Models (FMs), such as GPT, Sora, etc., have achieved remarkable results in many fields including natural language processing and computer vision. The application of FMs in autonomous driving holds considerable promise. For example, they can contribute to enhancing scene understanding and reasoning. By pre-training on rich linguistic and visual data, FMs can understand and interpret various elements in a driving scene, and provide cognitive reasoning to give linguistic and action instructions for driving decisions and planning. Furthermore, FMs can augment data based on the understanding of driving scenarios to provide feasible scenes of those rare occurrences in the long tail distribution that are unlikely to be encountered during routine driving and data collection. The enhancement can subsequently lead to improvement in the accuracy and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Another testament to the potential of FMs' applications lies in World Models, exemplified by the DREAMER series, which showcases the ability to comprehend physical laws and dynamics. Learning from massive data under the paradigm of self-supervised learning, World Model can generate unseen yet plausible driving environments, facilitating the enhancement in the prediction of road users' behaviors and the off-line training of driving strategies. In this paper, we synthesize the applications and future trends of FMs in autonomous driving. By utilizing the powerful capabilities of FMs, we strive to tackle the potential issues stemming from the long-tail distribution in autonomous driving, consequently advancing overall safety in this domain.</p></details> | 45 pages,8 figures |
| **[Agent Design Pattern Catalogue: A Collection of Architectural Patterns for Foundation Model based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10467v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation model-enabled generative artificial intelligence facilitates the development and implementation of agents, which can leverage distinguished reasoning and language processing capabilities to takes a proactive, autonomous role to pursue users' goals. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 16 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |
| **[PRISM: A Multi-Modal Generative Foundation Model for Slide-Level Histopathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10254v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in computational pathology promise to unlock the development of new clinical decision support systems and models for precision medicine. However, there is a mismatch between most clinical analysis, which is defined at the level of one or more whole slide images, and foundation models to date, which process the thousands of image tiles contained in a whole slide image separately. The requirement to train a network to aggregate information across a large number of tiles in multiple whole slide images limits these models' impact. In this work, we present a slide-level foundation model for H&E-stained histopathology, PRISM, that builds on Virchow tile embeddings and leverages clinical report text for pre-training. Using the tile embeddings, PRISM produces slide-level embeddings with the ability to generate clinical reports, resulting in several modes of use. Using text prompts, PRISM achieves zero-shot cancer detection and sub-typing performance approaching and surpassing that of a supervised aggregator model. Using the slide embeddings with linear classifiers, PRISM surpasses supervised aggregator models. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning of the PRISM slide encoder yields label-efficient training for biomarker prediction, a task that typically suffers from low availability of training data; an aggregator initialized with PRISM and trained on as little as 10% of the training data can outperform a supervised baseline that uses all of the data.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Foundation Model for Brain Lesion Segmentation with Mixture of Modality Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10246v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain lesion segmentation plays an essential role in neurological research and diagnosis. As brain lesions can be caused by various pathological alterations, different types of brain lesions tend to manifest with different characteristics on different imaging modalities. Due to this complexity, brain lesion segmentation methods are often developed in a task-specific manner. A specific segmentation model is developed for a particular lesion type and imaging modality. However, the use of task-specific models requires predetermination of the lesion type and imaging modality, which complicates their deployment in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a universal foundation model for 3D brain lesion segmentation, which can automatically segment different types of brain lesions for input data of various imaging modalities. We formulate a novel Mixture of Modality Experts (MoME) framework with multiple expert networks attending to different imaging modalities. A hierarchical gating network combines the expert predictions and fosters expertise collaboration. Furthermore, we introduce a curriculum learning strategy during training to avoid the degeneration of each expert network and preserve their specialization. We evaluated the proposed method on nine brain lesion datasets, encompassing five imaging modalities and eight lesion types. The results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art universal models and provides promising generalization to unseen datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The w...</summary><p>The work has been early accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, its application to time series data, particularly within foundational models, remains underexplored. This paper examines the impact of LoRA on contemporary time series foundational models: Lag-Llama, MOIRAI, and Chronos. We demonstrate LoRA's fine-tuning potential for forecasting the vital signs of sepsis patients in intensive care units (ICUs), emphasizing the models' adaptability to previously unseen, out-of-domain modalities. Integrating LoRA aims to enhance forecasting performance while reducing inefficiencies associated with fine-tuning large models on limited domain-specific data. Our experiments show that LoRA fine-tuning of time series foundational models significantly improves forecasting, achieving results comparable to state-of-the-art models trained from scratch on similar modalities. We conduct comprehensive ablation studies to demonstrate the trade-offs between the number of tunable parameters and forecasting performance and assess the impact of varying LoRA matrix ranks on model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures.

| **[Foundation Model-oriented Robustness: Robust Image Model Evaluation with Pretrained Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10632v3)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has demonstrated remarkable performance over finite datasets, yet whether the scores over the fixed benchmarks can sufficiently indicate the model's performance in the real world is still in discussion. In reality, an ideal robust model will probably behave similarly to the oracle (e.g., the human users), thus a good evaluation protocol is probably to evaluate the models' behaviors in comparison to the oracle. In this paper, we introduce a new robustness measurement that directly measures the image classification model's performance compared with a surrogate oracle (i.e., a foundation model). Besides, we design a simple method that can accomplish the evaluation beyond the scope of the benchmarks. Our method extends the image datasets with new samples that are sufficiently perturbed to be distinct from the ones in the original sets, but are still bounded within the same image-label structure the original test image represents, constrained by a foundation model pretrained with a large amount of samples. As a result, our new method will offer us a new way to evaluate the models' robustness performance, free of limitations of fixed benchmarks or constrained perturbations, although scoped by the power of the oracle. In addition to the evaluation results, we also leverage our generated data to understand the behaviors of the model and our new evaluation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024 Poster</p></details> |
| **[Histopathology Foundation Models Enable Accurate Ovarian Cancer Subtype Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09990v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pretrained transformers are increasingly being developed as generalised foundation models which can underpin powerful task-specific artificial intelligence models. Histopathology foundation models show promise across many tasks, but analyses have been limited by arbitrary hyperparameters that were not tuned to the specific task/dataset. We report the most rigorous single-task validation conducted to date of a histopathology foundation model, and the first performed in ovarian cancer subtyping. Attention-based multiple instance learning classifiers were compared using vision transformer and ResNet features generated through varied preprocessing and pretraining procedures. The training set consisted of 1864 whole slide images from 434 ovarian carcinoma cases at Leeds Hospitals. Five-class classification performance was evaluated through five-fold cross-validation, and these cross-validation models were ensembled for evaluation on a hold-out test set and an external set from the Transcanadian study. Reporting followed the TRIPOD+AI checklist. The vision transformer-based histopathology foundation model, UNI, performed best in every evaluation, with five-class balanced accuracies of 88% and 93% in hold-out internal and external testing, compared to the best ResNet model scores of 68% and 81%, respectively. Normalisations and augmentations aided the generalisability of ResNet-based models, but these still did not match the performance of UNI, which gave the best external performance in any ovarian cancer subtyping study to date. Histopathology foundation models offer a clear benefit to subtyping, improving classification performance to a degree where clinical utility is tangible, albeit with an increased computational burden. Such models could provide a second opinion in challenging cases and may improve the accuracy, objectivity, and efficiency of pathological diagnoses overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[Many-Shot In-Context Learning in Multimodal Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09798v1)** | 2024-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are well-known to be effective at few-shot in-context learning (ICL). Recent advancements in multimodal foundation models have enabled unprecedentedly long context windows, presenting an opportunity to explore their capability to perform ICL with many more demonstrating examples. In this work, we evaluate the performance of multimodal foundation models scaling from few-shot to many-shot ICL. We benchmark GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro across 10 datasets spanning multiple domains (natural imagery, medical imagery, remote sensing, and molecular imagery) and tasks (multi-class, multi-label, and fine-grained classification). We observe that many-shot ICL, including up to almost 2,000 multimodal demonstrating examples, leads to substantial improvements compared to few-shot (<100 examples) ICL across all of the datasets. Further, Gemini 1.5 Pro performance continues to improve log-linearly up to the maximum number of tested examples on many datasets. Given the high inference costs associated with the long prompts required for many-shot ICL, we also explore the impact of batching multiple queries in a single API call. We show that batching up to 50 queries can lead to performance improvements under zero-shot and many-shot ICL, with substantial gains in the zero-shot setting on multiple datasets, while drastically reducing per-query cost and latency. Finally, we measure ICL data efficiency of the models, or the rate at which the models learn from more demonstrating examples. We find that while GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro achieve similar zero-shot performance across the datasets, Gemini 1.5 Pro exhibits higher ICL data efficiency than GPT-4o on most datasets. Our results suggest that many-shot ICL could enable users to efficiently adapt multimodal foundation models to new applications and domains.

| **[Benchmark Early and Red Team Often: A Framework for Assessing and Managing Dual-Use Hazards of AI Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10986v1)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A concern about cutting-edge or "frontier" AI foundation models is that an adversary may use the models for preparing chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, (CBRN), cyber, or other attacks. At least two methods can identify foundation models with potential dual-use capability; each has advantages and disadvantages: A. Open benchmarks (based on openly available questions and answers), which are low-cost but accuracy-limited by the need to omit security-sensitive details; and B. Closed red team evaluations (based on private evaluation by CBRN and cyber experts), which are higher-cost but can achieve higher accuracy by incorporating sensitive details. We propose a research and risk-management approach using a combination of methods including both open benchmarks and closed red team evaluations, in a way that leverages advantages of both methods. We recommend that one or more groups of researchers with sufficient resources and access to a range of near-frontier and frontier foundation models run a set of foundation models through dual-use capability evaluation benchmarks and red team evaluations, then analyze the resulting sets of models' scores on benchmark and red team evaluations to see how correlated those are. If, as we expect, there is substantial correlation between the dual-use potential benchmark scores and the red team evaluation scores, then implications include the following: The open benchmarks should be used frequently during foundation model development as a quick, low-cost measure of a model's dual-use potential; and if a particular model gets a high score on the dual-use potential benchmark, then more in-depth red team assessments of that model's dual-use capability should be performed. We also discuss limitations and mitigations for our approach, e.g., if model developers try to game benchmarks by including a version of benchmark test data in a model's training data.</p></details> | 62 pages |

SAR Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) focuses on detecting and classifying various target categories under different image conditions. The current deep learning-based SAR ATR methods are typically designed for specific datasets and applications. Various target characteristics, scene background information, and sensor parameters across ATR datasets challenge the generalization of those methods. This paper aims to achieve general SAR ATR based on a foundation model with Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). Our motivation is to break through the specific dataset and condition limitations and obtain universal perceptual capabilities across the target, scene, and sensor. A foundation model named SARATR-X is proposed with the following four aspects: pre-training dataset, model backbone, SSL, and evaluation task. First, we integrated 14 datasets with various target categories and imaging conditions as a pre-training dataset. Second, different model backbones were discussed to find the most suitable approaches for remote-sensing images. Third, we applied two-stage training and SAR gradient features to ensure the diversity and scalability of SARATR-X. Finally, SARATR-X has achieved competitive and superior performance on 5 datasets with 8 task settings, which shows that the foundation model can achieve universal SAR ATR. We believe it is time to embrace fundamental models for SAR image interpretation in the era of increasing big data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom of Committee: Distilling from Foundation Model to Specialized Application Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14035v3)** | 2024-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have yielded impressive performance across a wide range of tasks. Meanwhile, for specific applications, practitioners have been developing specialized application models. To enjoy the benefits of both kinds of models, one natural path is to transfer the knowledge in foundation models into specialized application models, which are generally more efficient for serving. Techniques from knowledge distillation may be applied here, where the application model learns to mimic the foundation model. However, specialized application models and foundation models have substantial gaps in capacity, employing distinct architectures, using different input features from different modalities, and being optimized on different distributions. These differences in model characteristics lead to significant challenges for distillation methods. In this work, we propose creating a teaching committee comprising both foundation model teachers and complementary teachers. Complementary teachers possess model characteristics akin to the student's, aiming to bridge the gap between the foundation model and specialized application models for a smoother knowledge transfer. Further, to accommodate the dissimilarity among the teachers in the committee, we introduce DiverseDistill, which allows the student to understand the expertise of each teacher and extract task knowledge. Our evaluations demonstrate that adding complementary teachers enhances student performance. Finally, DiverseDistill consistently outperforms baseline distillation methods, regardless of the teacher choices, resulting in significantly improved student performance.</p></details> |  |

There is an explosion of computational methods and tools, particularly computer vision, for extracting biologically relevant information from images for science and conservation. Yet most of these are bespoke approaches designed for a specific task and are not easily adaptable or extendable to new questions, contexts, and datasets. A vision model for general organismal biology questions on images is of timely need. To approach this, we curate and release TreeOfLife-10M, the largest and most diverse ML-ready dataset of biology images. We then develop BioCLIP, a foundation model for the tree of life, leveraging the unique properties of biology captured by TreeOfLife-10M, namely the abundance and variety of images of plants, animals, and fungi, together with the availability of rich structured biological knowledge. We rigorously benchmark our approach on diverse fine-grained biology classification tasks and find that BioCLIP consistently and substantially outperforms existing baselines (by 16% to 17% absolute). Intrinsic evaluation reveals that BioCLIP has learned a hierarchical representation conforming to the tree of life, shedding light on its strong generalizability. https://imageomics.github.io/bioclip has models, data and code.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 (oral) camera-ready version; data released</p></details> |

This highlights the need for efficient adaptation methods to adapt these models to endoscopic depth estimation. We propose Endoscopic Depth Any Camera (EndoDAC) which is an efficient self-supervised depth estimation framework that adapts foundation models to endoscopic scenes. Specifically, we develop the Dynamic Vector-Based Low-Rank Adaptation (DV-LoRA) and employ Convolutional Neck blocks to tailor the foundational model to the surgical domain, utilizing remarkably few trainable parameters. Given that camera information is not always accessible, we also introduce a self-supervised adaptation strategy that estimates camera intrinsics using the pose encoder. Our framework is capable of being trained solely on monocular surgical videos from any camera, ensuring minimal training costs. Experiments demonstrate that our approach obtains superior performance even with fewer training epochs and unaware of the ground truth camera intrinsics.

We argue, that this correctness needs to be foundational: correctness needs to be based on the operational semantics of their execution environment. In this work we present a foundational system - the DeepSEA system - targeting the Ethereum blockchain as the largest smart contract platform. The DeepSEA system has a small but sufficiently rich programming language amenable for verification, the DeepSEA language, and a verified DeepSEA compiler. Together they enable true end-to-end verification for smart contracts. We demonstrate usability through two case studies: a realistic contract for Decentralized Finance and contract for crowdfunding.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Billion-scale Foundation Model for Remote Sensing Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.05215v3)** | 2024-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the potential of foundation models in visual tasks has garnered significant attention, pretraining these models before downstream tasks has become a crucial step. The three key factors in pretraining foundation models are the pretraining method, the size of the pretraining dataset, and the number of model parameters. Recently, research in the remote sensing field has focused primarily on the pretraining method and the size of the dataset, with limited emphasis on the number of model parameters. This paper addresses this gap by examining the effect of increasing the number of model parameters on the performance of foundation models in downstream tasks such as rotated object detection and semantic segmentation. We pretrained foundation models with varying numbers of parameters, including 86M, 605.26M, 1.3B, and 2.4B, to determine whether performance in downstream tasks improved with an increase in parameters. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first billion-scale foundation model in the remote sensing field. Furthermore, we propose an effective method for scaling up and fine-tuning a vision transformer in the remote sensing field. To evaluate general performance in downstream tasks, we employed the DOTA v2.0 and DIOR-R benchmark datasets for rotated object detection, and the Potsdam and LoveDA datasets for semantic segmentation. Experimental results demonstrated that, across all benchmark datasets and downstream tasks, the performance of the foundation models and data efficiency improved as the number of parameters increased. Moreover, our models achieve the state-of-the-art performance on several datasets including DIOR-R, Postdam, and LoveDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is the accepted version for IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (IEEE J-STARS)</p></details> |

Pre-training large models on time series data is challenging due to (1) the absence of a large and cohesive public time series repository, and (2) diverse time series characteristics which make multi-dataset training onerous. Additionally, (3) experimental benchmarks to evaluate these models, especially in scenarios with limited resources, time, and supervision, are still in their nascent stages. To address these challenges, we compile a large and diverse collection of public time series, called the Time series Pile, and systematically tackle time series-specific challenges to unlock large-scale multi-dataset pre-training. Finally, we build on recent work to design a benchmark to evaluate time series foundation models on diverse tasks and datasets in limited supervision settings. Experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our pre-trained models with minimal data and task-specific fine-tuning. Finally, we present several interesting empirical observations about large pre-trained time series models. Pre-trained models (AutonLab/MOMENT-1-large) and Time Series Pile (AutonLab/Timeseries-PILE) are available on Huggingface.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024.

However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundational models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical records, imaging data, and patient outcomes. It employs data preprocessing techniques and transformer-based architectures to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of the embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models have been useful in natural language processing and some vision tasks for some time, the foundation model developed with image segmentation in mind - Segment Anything Model (SAM) - has been developed only recently and has shown similar promise. However, there are still no systematic analyses or "best-practice" guidelines for optimal fine-tuning of SAM for medical image segmentation. This work summarizes existing fine-tuning strategies with various backbone architectures, model components, and fine-tuning algorithms across 18 combinations, and evaluates them on 17 datasets covering all common radiology modalities. Our study reveals that (1) fine-tuning SAM leads to slightly better performance than previous segmentation methods, (2) fine-tuning strategies that use parameter-efficient learning in both the encoder and decoder are superior to other strategies, (3) network architecture has a small impact on final performance, (4) further training SAM with self-supervised learning can improve final model performance. We also demonstrate the ineffectiveness of some methods popular in the literature and further expand our experiments into few-shot and prompt-based settings. Lastly, we released our code and MRI-specific fine-tuned weights, which consistently obtained superior performance over the original SAM, at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/mazurowski-lab/finetune-SAM</p></details> |

We collected data from 18 researchers using an interface that we designed using network simplification methods and analyzed how users browsed and identified important papers. Our analysis reveals six major patterns used for identifying papers of interest, which can be categorized into three key components: Fields, Bridges, and Foundations, each viewed from two distinct perspectives: layout-oriented and connection-oriented. The connection-oriented approach was found to be more effective for selecting relevant papers, but the layout-oriented method was adopted more often, even though it led to unexpected results and user frustration. Our findings emphasize the importance of integrating these components and the necessity to balance visual layouts with meaningful connections to enhance the effectiveness of citation networks in academic browsing systems.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards a clinically accessible radiology foundation model: open-access and lightweight, with automated evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08002v4)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling laws and extraordinary performance of large foundation models motivate the development and utilization of such models in biomedicine. However, despite early promising results on some biomedical benchmarks, there are still major challenges that need to be addressed before these models can be used in real-world clinics. Frontier general-domain models such as GPT-4V still have significant performance gaps in multimodal biomedical applications. More importantly, less-acknowledged pragmatic issues, including accessibility, model cost, and tedious manual evaluation make it hard for clinicians to use state-of-the-art large models directly on private patient data. Here, we explore training open-source small multimodal models (SMMs) to bridge competency gaps for unmet clinical needs in radiology. To maximize data efficiency, we adopt a modular approach by incorporating state-of-the-art pre-trained models for image and text modalities, and focusing on training a lightweight adapter to ground each modality to the text embedding space, as exemplified by LLaVA-Med. For training, we assemble a large dataset of over 697 thousand radiology image-text pairs. For evaluation, we propose CheXprompt, a GPT-4-based metric for factuality evaluation, and demonstrate its parity with expert evaluation. For best practice, we conduct a systematic ablation study on various choices in data engineering and multimodal training. The resulting LlaVA-Rad (7B) model attains state-of-the-art results on standard radiology tasks such as report generation and cross-modal retrieval, even outperforming much larger models such as GPT-4V and Med-PaLM M (84B). The inference of LlaVA-Rad is fast and can be performed on a single V100 GPU in private settings, offering a promising state-of-the-art tool for real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Foundation models such as ChatGPT, LLaMa, and CLIP, which are trained on vast datasets through methods including unsupervised pretraining, self-supervised learning, instructed fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning from human feedback, represent significant advancements in machine learning. These models, with their ability to generate coherent text and realistic images, are crucial for biomedical applications that require processing diverse data forms such as clinical reports, diagnostic images, and multimodal patient interactions. The incorporation of FL with these sophisticated models presents a promising strategy to harness their analytical power while safeguarding the privacy of sensitive medical data. This approach not only enhances the capabilities of FMs in medical diagnostics and personalized treatment but also addresses critical concerns about data privacy and security in healthcare. This survey reviews the current applications of FMs in federated settings, underscores the challenges, and identifies future research directions including scaling FMs, managing data diversity, and enhancing communication efficiency within FL frameworks. The objective is to encourage further research into the combined potential of FMs and FL, laying the groundwork for groundbreaking healthcare innovations.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Enhancing Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation with Multi-modal Foundation Models: An End-to-End Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06586v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a core computer vision problem, but the high costs of data annotation have hindered its wide application. Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) offers a cost-efficient workaround to extensive labeling in comparison to fully-supervised methods by using partial or incomplete labels. Existing WSSS methods have difficulties in learning the boundaries of objects leading to poor segmentation results. We propose a novel and effective framework that addresses these issues by leveraging visual foundation models inside the bounding box. Adopting a two-stage WSSS framework, our proposed network consists of a pseudo-label generation module and a segmentation module. The first stage leverages Segment Anything Model (SAM) to generate high-quality pseudo-labels. To alleviate the problem of delineating precise boundaries, we adopt SAM inside the bounding box with the help of another pre-trained foundation model (e.g., Grounding-DINO). Furthermore, we eliminate the necessity of using the supervision of image labels, by employing CLIP in classification. Then in the second stage, the generated high-quality pseudo-labels are used to train an off-the-shelf segmenter that achieves the state-of-the-art performance on PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014.</p></details> |  |

We present a method for self-supervised domain adaptation for the scenario where annotated source domain data (e.g. from synthetic generation) is available, but the target domain data is completely unannotated. Our method targets the semantic segmentation task and leverages a segmentation foundation model (Segment Anything Model) to obtain segment information on unannotated data. We take inspiration from recent advances in unsupervised local feature learning and propose an invariance-variance loss over the detected segments for regularizing feature representations in the target domain. Crucially, this loss structure and network architecture can handle overlapping segments and oversegmentation as produced by Segment Anything. We demonstrate the advantage of our method on the challenging YCB-Video and HomebrewedDB datasets and show that it outperforms prior work and, on YCB-Video, even a network trained with real annotations. Additionally, we provide insight through model ablations and show applicability to a custom robotic application.</p></details> |  |
| **[Muting Whisper: A Universal Acoustic Adversarial Attack on Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06134v1)** | 2024-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in large speech foundation models like Whisper have led to their widespread use in many automatic speech recognition (ASR) applications. These systems incorporate `special tokens' in their vocabulary, such as $\texttt{<endoftext>}$, to guide their language generation process. However, we demonstrate that these tokens can be exploited by adversarial attacks to manipulate the model's behavior. We propose a simple yet effective method to learn a universal acoustic realization of Whisper's $\texttt{<endoftext>}$ token, which, when prepended to any speech signal, encourages the model to ignore the speech and only transcribe the special token, effectively `muting' the model. Our experiments demonstrate that the same, universal 0.64-second adversarial audio segment can successfully mute a target Whisper ASR model for over 97\% of speech samples. Moreover, we find that this universal adversarial audio segment often transfers to new datasets and tasks. Overall this work demonstrates the vulnerability of Whisper models to `muting' adversarial attacks, where such attacks can pose both risks and potential benefits in real-world settings: for example the attack can be used to bypass speech moderation systems, or conversely the attack can also be used to protect private speech data.</p></details> |  |

However, the field of experimental design, grounded on black-box optimization, has been much less affected by such a paradigm shift, even though integrating LLMs with optimization presents a unique landscape ripe for exploration. In this position paper, we frame the field of black-box optimization around sequence-based foundation models and organize their relationship with previous literature.

The currently emerging foundation models in the field of text, speech and image processing offer completely new possibilities for developing AI applications. This whitepaper shows how the trustworthiness of an AI application developed with foundation models can be evaluated and ensured. For this purpose, the application-specific, risk-based approach for testing and ensuring the trustworthiness of AI applications, as developed in the 'AI Assessment Catalog - Guideline for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence' by Fraunhofer IAIS, is transferred to the context of foundation models. Special consideration is given to the fact that specific risks of foundation models can have an impact on the AI application and must also be taken into account when checking trustworthiness.

It becomes a new open challenge to enable the foundation model to capture user preference changes in a timely manner with reasonable communication and computation costs while preserving privacy. This paper proposes a novel federated adaptation mechanism to enhance the foundation model-based recommendation system in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, each client will learn a lightweight personalized adapter using its private data. The adapter then collaborates with pre-trained foundation models to provide recommendation service efficiently with fine-grained manners. Importantly, users' private behavioral data remains secure as it is not shared with the server. This data localization-based privacy preservation is embodied via the federated learning framework. The model can ensure that shared knowledge is incorporated into all adapters while simultaneously preserving each user's personal preferences. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's superior performance.

We introduce a novel approach to create accurate, sparse foundational versions of performant LLMs that achieve full accuracy recovery for fine-tuning tasks at up to 70% sparsity. We achieve this for the LLaMA-2 7B model by combining the SparseGPT one-shot pruning method and sparse pretraining of those models on a subset of the SlimPajama dataset mixed with a Python subset of The Stack dataset. We exhibit training acceleration due to sparsity on Cerebras CS-3 chips that closely matches theoretical scaling. In addition, we establish inference acceleration of up to 3x on CPUs by utilizing Neural Magic's DeepSparse engine and 1.7x on GPUs through Neural Magic's nm-vllm engine. The above gains are realized via sparsity alone, thus enabling further gains through additional use of quantization. Specifically, we show a total speedup on CPUs for sparse-quantized LLaMA models of up to 8.6x. We demonstrate these results across diverse, challenging tasks, including chat, instruction following, code generation, arithmetic reasoning, and summarization to prove their generality.

However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for complex tasks. We propose a novel, theoretically sound method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that our approach CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset causal inference methodologies.</p></details> |  |

As the technique keeps attracting attention from the AI community, an increasing number of foundation models are becoming publicly accessible. However, a significant shortcoming of most of these models lies in their performance in specialized-domain and task-specific applications, necessitating domain- and task-aware fine-tuning to develop effective scientific language models. As the number of available foundation models and specialized tasks keeps growing, the job of training scientific language models becomes highly nontrivial. In this paper, we initiate steps to tackle this issue. We introduce an extensible and lightweight toolkit, LMFlow, which aims to simplify the domain- and task-aware finetuning of general foundation models. LMFlow offers a complete finetuning workflow for a foundation model to support specialized training with limited computing resources.

To this end, we present Foundation Model Embedded Gaussian Splatting (FMGS), which incorporates vision-language embeddings of foundation models into 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS). The key contribution of this work is an efficient method to reconstruct and represent 3D vision-language models. This is achieved by distilling feature maps generated from image-based foundation models into those rendered from our 3D model. To ensure high-quality rendering and fast training, we introduce a novel scene representation by integrating strengths from both GS and multi-resolution hash encodings (MHE). Our effective training procedure also introduces a pixel alignment loss that makes the rendered feature distance of the same semantic entities close, following the pixel-level semantic boundaries. Our results demonstrate remarkable multi-view semantic consistency, facilitating diverse downstream tasks, beating state-of-the-art methods by 10.2 percent on open-vocabulary language-based object detection, despite that we are 851X faster for inference. This research explores the intersection of vision, language, and 3D scene representation, paving the way for enhanced scene understanding in uncontrolled real-world environments. We plan to release the code on the project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/fmgs</p></details> |
| **[Automating the Enterprise with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03710v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating enterprise workflows could unlock $4 trillion/year in productivity gains. Despite being of interest to the data management community for decades, the ultimate vision of end-to-end workflow automation has remained elusive. Current solutions rely on process mining and robotic process automation (RPA), in which a bot is hard-coded to follow a set of predefined rules for completing a workflow. Through case studies of a hospital and large B2B enterprise, we find that the adoption of RPA has been inhibited by high set-up costs (12-18 months), unreliable execution (60% initial accuracy), and burdensome maintenance (requiring multiple FTEs). Multimodal foundation models (FMs) such as GPT-4 offer a promising new approach for end-to-end workflow automation given their generalized reasoning and planning abilities. To study these capabilities we propose ECLAIR, a system to automate enterprise workflows with minimal human supervision. We conduct initial experiments showing that multimodal FMs can address the limitations of traditional RPA with (1) near-human-level understanding of workflows (93% accuracy on a workflow understanding task) and (2) instant set-up with minimal technical barrier (based solely on a natural language description of a workflow, ECLAIR achieves end-to-end completion rates of 40%). We identify human-AI collaboration, validation, and self-improvement as open challenges, and suggest ways they can be solved with data management techniques.

| **[Mapping the Unseen: Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping with Dynamic Labeling using Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02162v1)** | 2024-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of robotics and computer vision, efficient and accurate semantic mapping remains a significant challenge due to the growing demand for intelligent machines that can comprehend and interact with complex environments. Conventional panoptic mapping methods, however, are limited by predefined semantic classes, thus making them ineffective for handling novel or unforeseen objects. In response to this limitation, we introduce the Unified Promptable Panoptic Mapping (UPPM) method. UPPM utilizes recent advances in foundation models to enable real-time, on-demand label generation using natural language prompts. By incorporating a dynamic labeling strategy into traditional panoptic mapping techniques, UPPM provides significant improvements in adaptability and versatility while maintaining high performance levels in map reconstruction. We demonstrate our approach on real-world and simulated datasets. Results show that UPPM can accurately reconstruct scenes and segment objects while generating rich semantic labels through natural language interactions. A series of ablation experiments validated the advantages of foundation model-based labeling over fixed label sets.</p></details> |  |

However, the existing world models rely solely on statistical learning of how observations change in response to actions, lacking precise quantification of how accurate the surrogate dynamics are, which poses a significant challenge in safety-critical systems. To address this challenge, we propose foundation world models that embed observations into meaningful and causally latent representations. This enables the surrogate dynamics to directly predict causal future states by leveraging a training-free large language model. In two common benchmarks, this novel model outperforms standard world models in the safety prediction task and has a performance comparable to supervised learning despite not using any data. We evaluate its performance with a more specialized and system-relevant metric by comparing estimated states instead of aggregating observation-wide error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the Back to the Future-Robot Learning Going Probabilistic Workshop, co-located with ICRA 2024. https://openreview.net/forum?id=gHhBNIq9Cs</p></details> |

In this position piece we aim to shift the ML research community's priorities ever so slightly to a different modality: tabular data. Tabular data is the dominant modality in many fields, yet it is given hardly any research attention and significantly lags behind in terms of scale and power. We believe the time is now to start developing tabular foundation models, or what we coin a Large Tabular Model (LTM). LTMs could revolutionise the way science and ML use tabular data: not as single datasets that are analyzed in a vacuum, but contextualized with respect to related datasets. The potential impact is far-reaching: from few-shot tabular models to automating data science; from out-of-distribution synthetic data to empowering multidisciplinary scientific discovery. We intend to excite reflections on the modalities we study, and convince some researchers to study large tabular models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

In the real world, spatial understanding is often an ill-posed problem. There are a number of powerful classical methods that accurately regress relative pose, however, these approaches often lack the ability to leverage data-derived priors to resolve ambiguities. In multi-robot systems, these challenges are exacerbated by the need for accurate and frequent position estimates of cooperating agents. To this end, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot, visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data. Unlike prior work evaluated primarily on offline datasets, we design our model specifically for online evaluation and real-world deployment on cooperative robots. Our model is completely decentralized, platform agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing network infrastructure. In this work, we focus on relative pose estimation and local Bird's Eye View (BEV) prediction tasks. Unlike classical approaches, we show that our model can accurately predict relative poses without requiring camera overlap, and predict BEVs of regions not visible to the ego-agent. We demonstrate our model on a multi-robot formation control task outside the confines of the laboratory.</p></details> |  |

Our paper introduces a new foundation model, nach0, capable of solving various chemical and biological tasks: biomedical question answering, named entity recognition, molecular generation, molecular synthesis, attributes prediction, and others. nach0 is a multi-domain and multi-task encoder-decoder LLM pre-trained on unlabeled text from scientific literature, patents, and molecule strings to incorporate a range of chemical and linguistic knowledge. We employed instruction tuning, where specific task-related instructions are utilized to fine-tune nach0 for the final set of tasks. To train nach0 effectively, we leverage the NeMo framework, enabling efficient parallel optimization of both base and large model versions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on single-domain and cross-domain tasks.

Inspired by human sensorimotor adaptation mechanisms, we aim to train encoder-decoder networks that can be commonly used to learn novel motor skills in a single movement category. To train the policy network, we develop the multitask reinforcement learning method, where the policy needs to cope with changes in goals or environments with different reward functions or physical parameters of the environment in dynamic movement generation tasks. Here, as a concrete task, we evaluated the proposed method with the ball heading task using a monopod robot model. The results showed that the proposed method could adapt to novel target positions or inexperienced ball restitution coefficients. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the acquired foundational policy network originally learned for heading motion, can be used to generate an entirely new overhead kicking skill.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[What AIs are not Learning (and Why): Bio-Inspired Foundation Models for Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04267v7)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is hard to make robots (including telerobots) that are useful, and harder to make autonomous robots that are robust and general. Current smart robots are created using manual programming, mathematical models, planning frameworks, and reinforcement learning. These methods do not lead to the leaps in performance and generality seen with deep learning, generative AI, and foundation models (FMs). Today's robots do not learn to provide home care, to be nursing assistants, or to do household chores nearly as well as people do. Addressing the aspirational opportunities of robot service applications requires improving how they are created. The high cost of bipedal multi-sensory robots ("bodies") is a significant obstacle for both research and deployment. A deeper issue is that mainstream FMs ("minds") do not support sensing, acting, and learning in context in the real world. They do not lead to robots that communicate well or collaborate. They do not lead to robots that try to learn by experimenting, by asking others, or by imitation learning as appropriate. They do not lead to robots that know enough to be deployed widely in service applications. This paper focuses on what human-compatible service robots need to know. It recommends developing experiential (aka "robotic") FMs for bootstrapping them.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Ontologies are a well-known strategy for addressing such challenges, though given the complexity of the phenomenon, there are risks of reintroducing the interoperability challenges at the level of ontology representations. In the interest of avoiding such pitfalls, we introduce and defend characterizations of digital twins within the context of the Common Core Ontologies, an extension of the widely-used Basic Formal Ontology. We provide a set of definitions and design patterns relevant to the domain of digital twins, highlighted by illustrative use cases of digital twins and their physical counterparts. In doing so, we provide a foundation on which to build more sophisticated ontological content related and connected to digital twins.</p></details> | 14 |

VFMs like CLIP, DINOv2, SAM are trained with distinct objectives, exhibiting unique characteristics for various downstream tasks. We find that despite their conceptual differences, these models can be effectively merged into a unified model through multi-teacher distillation. We name this approach AM-RADIO (Agglomerative Model -- Reduce All Domains Into One). This integrative approach not only surpasses the performance of individual teacher models but also amalgamates their distinctive features, such as zero-shot vision-language comprehension, detailed pixel-level understanding, and open vocabulary segmentation capabilities. In pursuit of the most hardware-efficient backbone, we evaluated numerous architectures in our multi-teacher distillation pipeline using the same training recipe. This led to the development of a novel architecture (E-RADIO) that exceeds the performance of its predecessors and is at least 7x faster than the teacher models.

Foundation models, pre-trained models that can be adapted to downstream tasks with small datasets, could alleviate this problem. Researchers at Moorfields Eye Hospital (MEH) proposed RETFound-MEH, a foundation model for retinal imaging that was trained on 900,000 images, including private hospital data. Recently, data-efficient DERETFound was proposed that provides comparable performance while being trained on only 150,000 images that are all publicly available. However, both these models required very substantial resources to train initially and are resource-intensive in downstream use. We propose a novel Token Reconstruction objective that we use to train RETFound-Green, a retinal foundation model trained using only 75,000 publicly available images and 400 times less compute. We estimate the cost of training RETFound-MEH and DERETFound at $10,000 and $14,000, respectively, while RETFound-Green could be trained for less than $100, with equally reduced environmental impact. RETFound-Green is also far more efficient in downstream use: it can be downloaded 14 times faster, computes vector embeddings 2.7 times faster which then require 2.6 times less storage space. Despite this, RETFound-Green does not perform systematically worse. In fact, it performs best on 14 tasks, compared to six for DERETFound and two for RETFound-MEH. Our results suggest that RETFound-Green is a very efficient, high-performance retinal foundation model. We anticipate that our Token Reconstruction objective could be scaled up for even higher performance and be applied to other domains beyond retinal imaging.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we compare the performance of a foundational Vision Transformer (ViT) model with a baseline Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) model for missing value imputation in time series of multispectral satellite imagery. We randomly mask time series of satellite images using real-world cloud masks and train each model to reconstruct the missing pixels. The ViT model is fine-tuned from a pretrained model, while the CGAN is trained from scratch. Using quantitative evaluation metrics such as structural similarity index and mean absolute error as well as qualitative visual analysis, we assess imputation accuracy and contextual preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Essential Role of Causality in Foundation World Models for Embodied AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06665v2)** | 2024-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in foundation models, especially in large multi-modal models and conversational agents, have ignited interest in the potential of generally capable embodied agents. Such agents will require the ability to perform new tasks in many different real-world environments. However, current foundation models fail to accurately model physical interactions and are therefore insufficient for Embodied AI. The study of causality lends itself to the construction of veridical world models, which are crucial for accurately predicting the outcomes of possible interactions. This paper focuses on the prospects of building foundation world models for the upcoming generation of embodied agents and presents a novel viewpoint on the significance of causality within these. We posit that integrating causal considerations is vital to facilitating meaningful physical interactions with the world. Finally, we demystify misconceptions about causality in this context and present our outlook for future research.</p></details> |  |

By synthesizing a range of theoretical frameworks and application domains, this thesis aims to advance the machine learning foundations of multisensory AI. In the first part, we present a theoretical framework formalizing how modalities interact with each other to give rise to new information for a task. These interactions are the basic building blocks in all multimodal problems, and their quantification enables users to understand their multimodal datasets, design principled approaches to learn these interactions, and analyze whether their model has succeeded in learning. In the second part, we study the design of practical multimodal foundation models that generalize over many modalities and tasks, which presents a step toward grounding large language models to real-world sensory modalities. We introduce MultiBench, a unified large-scale benchmark across a wide range of modalities, tasks, and research areas, followed by the cross-modal attention and multimodal transformer architectures that now underpin many of today's multimodal foundation models. Scaling these architectures on MultiBench enables the creation of general-purpose multisensory AI systems, and we discuss our collaborative efforts in applying these models for real-world impact in affective computing, mental health, cancer prognosis, and robotics.

This paper introduces a novel system that combines the Segment Anything model (SAM) -- a transformer-based visual foundation model -- with a robotic arm on a mobile platform. The design of integrating a depth camera on the robotic arm's end-effector ensures continuous object tracking, significantly mitigating environmental uncertainties. By deploying on a mobile platform, our grasping system has an enhanced mobility, playing a key role in dynamic environments where adaptability are critical. This synthesis enables dynamic object segmentation, tracking, and grasping. It also elevates user interaction, allowing the robot to intuitively respond to various modalities such as clicks, drawings, or voice commands, beyond traditional robotic systems. Empirical assessments in both simulated and real-world demonstrate the system's capabilities. This configuration opens avenues for wide-ranging applications, from industrial settings, agriculture, and household tasks, to specialized assignments and beyond.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to STL, MTL offers a suite of benefits that enhance both the training process and the inference efficiency. MTL's key advantages encompass streamlined model architecture, performance enhancement, and cross-domain generalizability. Over the past twenty years, MTL has become widely recognized as a flexible and effective approach in various fields, including CV, NLP, recommendation systems, disease prognosis and diagnosis, and robotics. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the evolution of MTL, encompassing the technical aspects of cutting-edge methods from traditional approaches to deep learning and the latest trend of pretrained foundation models. Our survey methodically categorizes MTL techniques into five key areas: regularization, relationship learning, feature propagation, optimization, and pre-training. This categorization not only chronologically outlines the development of MTL but also dives into various specialized strategies within each category. Furthermore, the survey reveals how the MTL evolves from handling a fixed set of tasks to embracing a more flexible approach free from task or modality constraints. It explores the concepts of task-promptable and -agnostic training, along with the capacity for ZSL, which unleashes the untapped potential of this historically coveted learning paradigm. Overall, we hope this survey provides the research community with a comprehensive overview of the advancements in MTL from its inception in 1997 to the present in 2023.

However, a key hurdle in achieving this goal lies in the robots' ability to manipulate objects in their unstructured surrounding environments according to different tasks. The learning-based approach is considered an effective way to address generalization. The impressive performance of foundation models in the fields of computer vision and natural language suggests the potential of embedding foundation models into manipulation tasks as a viable path toward achieving general manipulation capability. However, we believe achieving general manipulation capability requires an overarching framework akin to auto driving. This framework should encompass multiple functional modules, with different foundation models assuming distinct roles in facilitating general manipulation capability. This survey focuses on the contributions of foundation models to robot learning for manipulation. We propose a comprehensive framework and detail how foundation models can address challenges in each module of the framework. What's more, we examine current approaches, outline challenges, suggest future research directions, and identify potential risks associated with integrating foundation models into this domain.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Federated Proxy Fine-Tuning (FedPFT), a novel method enhancing FMs adaptation in downstream tasks through FL by two key modules. First, the sub-FM construction module employs a layer-wise compression approach, facilitating comprehensive FM fine-tuning across all layers by emphasizing those crucial neurons. Second, the sub-FM alignment module conducts a two-step distillations-layer-level and neuron-level-before and during FL fine-tuning respectively, to reduce error of gradient by accurately aligning sub-FM with FM under theoretical guarantees. Experimental results on seven commonly used datasets (i.e., four text and three vision) demonstrate the superiority of FedPFT.</p></details> | Accepted by IJCAI'24 |

Specifically, we formulate the video-based PAR as a vision-language fusion problem and adopt a pre-trained foundation model CLIP to extract the visual features. More importantly, we propose a novel spatiotemporal side-tuning strategy to achieve parameter-efficient optimization of the pre-trained vision foundation model. To better utilize the semantic information, we take the full attribute list that needs to be recognized as another input and transform the attribute words/phrases into the corresponding sentence via split, expand, and prompt operations. Then, the text encoder of CLIP is utilized for embedding processed attribute descriptions. The averaged visual tokens and text tokens are concatenated and fed into a fusion Transformer for multi-modal interactive learning. The enhanced tokens will be fed into a classification head for pedestrian attribute prediction. Extensive experiments on two large-scale video-based PAR datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

However, large foundation models are typically trained on high-quality data, which poses a significant challenge, given the prevalence of poor-quality real-world data. This challenge is more pronounced for developing foundation models for physiological data; such data are often noisy, incomplete, or inconsistent. The present work aims to provide a toolset for developing foundation models on physiological data. We leverage a large dataset of photoplethysmography (PPG) signals from hospitalized intensive care patients. For this data, we propose SimQuality, a novel self-supervised learning task based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as the backbone to enforce representations to be similar for good and poor quality signals that are from similar physiological states. We pre-trained the SimQuality on over 36 million 30-second PPG pairs and then fine-tuned and tested on six downstream tasks using external datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach on all the downstream tasks, which are extremely important for heart monitoring on wearable devices. Our method indicates that CNNs can be an effective backbone for foundation models that are robust to training data quality.</p></details> |  |

These ``foundation'' models are often adapted to a variety of downstream tasks like classification, object detection, and segmentation with little-to-no training on the target dataset. In this work, we perform a robustness analysis of Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for segmentation tasks and focus on robustness against real-world distribution shift inspired perturbations. We benchmark seven state-of-the-art segmentation architectures using 2 different perturbed datasets, MS COCO-P and ADE20K-P, with 17 different perturbations with 5 severity levels each. Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) VFMs exhibit vulnerabilities to compression-induced corruptions, (2) despite not outpacing all of unimodal models in robustness, multimodal models show competitive resilience in zero-shot scenarios, and (3) VFMs demonstrate enhanced robustness for certain object categories.

| **[Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition for Medical Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17184v1)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The popularity of large-scale pre-training has promoted the development of medical foundation models. However, some studies have shown that although foundation models exhibit strong general feature extraction capabilities, their performance on specific tasks is still inferior to task-specific methods. In this paper, we explore a new perspective called ``Knowledge Decomposition'' to improve the performance on specific medical tasks, which deconstruct the foundation model into multiple lightweight expert models, each dedicated to a particular task, with the goal of improving specialization while concurrently mitigating resource expenditure. To accomplish the above objective, we design a novel framework named Low-Rank Knowledge Decomposition (LoRKD), which explicitly separates graidents by incorporating low-rank expert modules and the efficient knowledge separation convolution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the decomposed models perform well in terms of performance and transferability, even surpassing the original foundation models.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[3D-LFM: Lifting Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11894v2)** | 2024-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The lifting of 3D structure and camera from 2D landmarks is at the cornerstone of the entire discipline of computer vision. Traditional methods have been confined to specific rigid objects, such as those in Perspective-n-Point (PnP) problems, but deep learning has expanded our capability to reconstruct a wide range of object classes (e.g. C3DPO and PAUL) with resilience to noise, occlusions, and perspective distortions. All these techniques, however, have been limited by the fundamental need to establish correspondences across the 3D training data -- significantly limiting their utility to applications where one has an abundance of "in-correspondence" 3D data. Our approach harnesses the inherent permutation equivariance of transformers to manage varying number of points per 3D data instance, withstands occlusions, and generalizes to unseen categories. We demonstrate state of the art performance across 2D-3D lifting task benchmarks. Since our approach can be trained across such a broad class of structures we refer to it simply as a 3D Lifting Foundation Model (3D-LFM) -- the first of its kind.</p></details> | <details><summary>Visit...</summary><p>Visit the project page at https://3dlfm.github.io for links to additional media, code, and videos.

| **[Batched Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05677v3)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained attention for fine-tuning foundation models by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. While LoRA offers numerous advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request. To mitigate this constraint, we introduce Fast LoRA (FLoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests. We empirically demonstrate that FLoRA retains the performance merits of LoRA, showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6 languages.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Iris-SAM: Iris Segmentation Using a Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06497v2)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Iris segmentation is a critical component of an iris biometric system and it involves extracting the annular iris region from an ocular image. In this work, we develop a pixel-level iris segmentation model from a foundational model, viz., Segment Anything Model (SAM), that has been successfully used for segmenting arbitrary objects. The primary contribution of this work lies in the integration of different loss functions during the fine-tuning of SAM on ocular images. In particular, the importance of Focal Loss is borne out in the fine-tuning process since it strategically addresses the class imbalance problem (i.e., iris versus non-iris pixels). Experiments on ND-IRIS-0405, CASIA-Iris-Interval-v3, and IIT-Delhi-Iris datasets convey the efficacy of the trained model for the task of iris segmentation. For instance, on the ND-IRIS-0405 dataset, an average segmentation accuracy of 99.58% was achieved, compared to the best baseline performance of 89.75%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prefix Text as a Yarn: Eliciting Non-English Alignment in Foundation Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16766v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has been a straightforward approach for tailoring the output of foundation large language model (LLM) to specific preferences, concerns have been raised about the depth of this alignment, with some critiques suggesting it is merely "superficial". We critically examine this hypothesis within the scope of cross-lingual generation tasks, proposing that the effectiveness of SFT may be constrained by its reliance on prior tokens to guide cross-lingual generation. Based on this crucial insight, and in response to the challenges posed by the costly and limited availability of non-English data for SFT, we introduce a novel training-free alignment method named PreTTY, which employs minimal task-related prior tokens to bridge the foundation LLM and the SFT LLM, achieving comparable performance without training. Experiments on machine translation and part-of-speech tagging across eight languages demonstrate the efficacy of PreTTY in cross-lingual settings. Remarkably, by initiating the decoding process with only one or two prior tokens, foundation LLMs can achieve performance comparable to their SFT counterparts. This method presents a cost-effective alternative to SFT and advances the democratization of multilingual LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Segmentation Refiner for Ultrasound Applications with Zero-Shot Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16325v1)** | 2024-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of deep learning in medical imaging analysis, medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality labeled images for supervision. Further, the significant domain gap between natural and medical images in general and ultrasound images in particular hinders fine-tuning models trained on natural images to the task at hand. In this work, we address the performance degradation of segmentation models in low-data regimes and propose a prompt-less segmentation method harnessing the ability of segmentation foundation models to segment abstract shapes. We do that via our novel prompt point generation algorithm which uses coarse semantic segmentation masks as input and a zero-shot prompt-able foundation model as an optimization target. We demonstrate our method on a segmentation findings task (pathologic anomalies) in ultrasound images. Our method's advantages are brought to light in varying degrees of low-data regime experiments on a small-scale musculoskeletal ultrasound images dataset, yielding a larger performance gain as the training set size decreases.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, pre-training foundation models on large quantities of available data and then transfer to low-data downstream tasks is a promising direction. However, how to design effective foundation models for molecular learning remains an open question, with existing approaches typically focusing on models with large parameter capacities. In this work, we propose $\texttt{MiniMol}$, a foundational model for molecular learning with 10 million parameters. $\texttt{MiniMol}$ is pre-trained on a mix of roughly 3300 sparsely defined graph- and node-level tasks of both quantum and biological nature. The pre-training dataset includes approximately 6 million molecules and 500 million labels. To demonstrate the generalizability of $\texttt{MiniMol}$ across tasks, we evaluate it on downstream tasks from the Therapeutic Data Commons (TDC) ADMET group showing significant improvements over the prior state-of-the-art foundation model across 17 tasks. $\texttt{MiniMol}$ will be a public and open-sourced model for future research.</p></details> |  |

In this work, a vision foundation model is introduced for crack segmentation. Two parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods, adapter and low-rank adaptation, are adopted to fine-tune the foundation model in semantic segmentation: the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The fine-tuned CrackSAM shows excellent performance on different scenes and materials. To test the zero-shot performance of the proposed method, two unique datasets related to road and exterior wall cracks are collected, annotated and open-sourced, for a total of 810 images. Comparative experiments are conducted with twelve mature semantic segmentation models. On datasets with artificial noise and previously unseen datasets, the performance of CrackSAM far exceeds that of all state-of-the-art models. CrackSAM exhibits remarkable superiority, particularly under challenging conditions such as dim lighting, shadows, road markings, construction joints, and other interference factors. These cross-scenario results demonstrate the outstanding zero-shot capability of foundation models and provide new ideas for developing vision models in civil engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Integrated Data Processing Framework for Pretraining Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16358v2)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability of the foundation models heavily relies on large-scale, diverse, and high-quality pretraining data. In order to improve data quality, researchers and practitioners often have to manually curate datasets from difference sources and develop dedicated data cleansing pipeline for each data repository. Lacking a unified data processing framework, this process is repetitive and cumbersome. To mitigate this issue, we propose a data processing framework that integrates a Processing Module which consists of a series of operators at different granularity levels, and an Analyzing Module which supports probing and evaluation of the refined data. The proposed framework is easy to use and highly flexible. In this demo paper, we first introduce how to use this framework with some example use cases and then demonstrate its effectiveness in improving the data quality with an automated evaluation with ChatGPT and an end-to-end evaluation in pretraining the GPT-2 model.

Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision-transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 230 to 707 PFLOPS, with scaling efficiency maintained at 78% to 96% across 24,576 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</p></details> |  |
| **[FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-designed algorithms have long been fundamental in solving a variety of scientific and engineering challenges. Recently, data-driven deep learning methods have also risen to prominence, offering innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields. While traditional algorithms excel in capturing the core aspects of specific problems, they often lack the flexibility needed for varying problem conditions due to the absence of specific data. Conversely, while data-driven approaches utilize vast datasets, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{FMint} (Foundation Model based on Initialization), a generative pre-trained model that synergizes the precision of human-designed algorithms with the adaptability of data-driven methods. This model is specifically engineered for high-accuracy simulation of dynamical systems. Starting from initial trajectories provided by conventional methods, FMint quickly delivers highly accurate solutions. It incorporates in-context learning and has been pre-trained on a diverse corpus of 500,000 dynamical systems, showcasing exceptional generalization across a broad spectrum of real-world applications. By effectively combining algorithmic rigor with data-driven flexibility, FMint sets the stage for the next generation of scientific foundation models, tackling complex problems with both efficiency and high accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Center Study on the Adaptability of a Shared Foundation Model for Electronic Health Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11483v2)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models hold promise for transforming AI in healthcare by providing modular components that are easily adaptable to downstream healthcare tasks, making AI development more scalable and cost-effective. Structured EHR foundation models, trained on coded medical records from millions of patients, demonstrated benefits including increased performance with fewer training labels, and improved robustness to distribution shifts. However, questions remain on the feasibility of sharing these models across different hospitals and their performance for local task adaptation. This multi-center study examined the adaptability of a recently released structured EHR foundation model ($FM_{SM}$), trained on longitudinal medical record data from 2.57M Stanford Medicine patients. Experiments were conducted using EHR data at The Hospital for Sick Children and MIMIC-IV. We assessed both adaptability via continued pretraining on local data, and task adaptability compared to baselines of training models from scratch at each site, including a local foundation model. We evaluated the performance of these models on 8 clinical prediction tasks. In both datasets, adapting the off-the-shelf $FM_{SM}$ matched the performance of GBM models locally trained on all data while providing a 13% improvement in settings with few task-specific training labels. With continued pretraining on local data, label efficiency substantially improved, such that $FM_{SM}$ required fewer than 1% of training examples to match the fully trained GBM's performance. Continued pretraining was also 60 to 90% more sample-efficient than training local foundation models from scratch. Our findings show that adapting shared EHR foundation models across hospitals provides improved prediction performance at less cost, underscoring the utility of base foundation models as modular components to streamline the development of healthcare AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, 14 appendices</p></details> |

Federated Learning is a promising solution for such forecasting by enabling collaborative model training without sharing raw data. However, it faces three main challenges that hinder its reliability: (1) data heterogeneity among devices due to geographic differences; (2) data homogeneity within individual devices and (3) communication overload from sending large model parameters for collaboration. To address these challenges, this paper propose Federated Prompt Learning for Weather Foundation Models on Devices (FedPoD), which enables devices to obtain highly customized models while maintaining communication efficiency. Concretely, our Adaptive Prompt Tuning leverages lightweight prompts guide frozen foundation model to generate more precise predictions, also conducts prompt-based multi-level communication to encourage multi-source knowledge fusion and regulate optimization. Additionally, Dynamic Graph Modeling constructs graphs from prompts, prioritizing collaborative training among devices with similar data distributions to against heterogeneity. Extensive experiments demonstrates FedPoD leads the performance among state-of-the-art baselines across various setting in real-world on-device weather forecasting datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Main Track in IJCAI'24 (the 33rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence)</p></details> |

Automated readers of LFT results can yield many benefits including empowering blind people to independently learn about their health and accelerating data entry for large-scale monitoring (e.g., for pandemics such as Covid) by using only a single photograph per LFT test. Accordingly, we explore the abilities of modern foundation vision language models (VLMs) in interpreting such tests. To enable this analysis, we first create a new labeled dataset with hierarchical segmentations of each LFT test and its nested test result window. We call this dataset LFT-Grounding. Next, we benchmark eight modern VLMs in zero-shot settings for analyzing these images. We demonstrate that current VLMs frequently fail to correctly identify the type of LFT test, interpret the test results, locate the nested result window of the LFT tests, and recognize LFT tests when they partially obfuscated. To facilitate community-wide progress towards automated LFT reading, we publicly release our dataset at https://iamstuti.github.io/lft_grounding_foundation_models/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Pixel-Wise Supervision for Medical Image Segmentation: From Traditional Models to Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13239v1)** | 2024-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays an important role in many image-guided clinical approaches. However, existing segmentation algorithms mostly rely on the availability of fully annotated images with pixel-wise annotations for training, which can be both labor-intensive and expertise-demanding, especially in the medical imaging domain where only experts can provide reliable and accurate annotations. To alleviate this challenge, there has been a growing focus on developing segmentation methods that can train deep models with weak annotations, such as image-level, bounding boxes, scribbles, and points. The emergence of vision foundation models, notably the Segment Anything Model (SAM), has introduced innovative capabilities for segmentation tasks using weak annotations for promptable segmentation enabled by large-scale pre-training. Adopting foundation models together with traditional learning methods has increasingly gained recent interest research community and shown potential for real-world applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of recent progress on annotation-efficient learning for medical image segmentation utilizing weak annotations before and in the era of foundation models. Furthermore, we analyze and discuss several challenges of existing approaches, which we believe will provide valuable guidance for shaping the trajectory of foundational models to further advance the field of medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Foundation Model for Partial Differential Equations: Multi-Operator Learning and Extrapolation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12355v2)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as large language models, have demonstrated success in addressing various language and image processing tasks. In this work, we introduce a multi-modal foundation model for scientific problems, named PROSE-PDE. Our model, designed for bi-modality to bi-modality learning, is a multi-operator learning approach which can predict future states of spatiotemporal systems while concurrently learning the underlying governing equations of the physical system. Specifically, we focus on multi-operator learning by training distinct one-dimensional time-dependent nonlinear constant coefficient partial differential equations, with potential applications to many physical applications including physics, geology, and biology. More importantly, we provide three extrapolation studies to demonstrate that PROSE-PDE can generalize physical features through the robust training of multiple operators and that the proposed model can extrapolate to predict PDE solutions whose models or data were unseen during the training. Furthermore, we show through systematic numerical experiments that the utilization of the symbolic modality in our model effectively resolves the well-posedness problems with training multiple operators and thus enhances our model's predictive capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Model assisted Weakly Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12861v1)** | 2024-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current point cloud semantic segmentation has achieved great advances when given sufficient labels. However, the dense annotation of LiDAR point clouds remains prohibitively expensive and time-consuming, unable to keep up with the continuously growing volume of data. In this paper, we propose annotating images with scattered points, followed by utilizing SAM (a Foundation model) to generate semantic segmentation labels for the images. Finally, by mapping the segmentation labels of the images to the LiDAR space using the intrinsic and extrinsic parameters of the camera and LiDAR, we obtain labels for point cloud semantic segmentation, and release Scatter-KITTI and Scatter-nuScenes, which are the first works to utilize image segmentation-based SAM for weakly supervised point cloud semantic segmentation. Furthermore, to mitigate the influence of erroneous pseudo labels obtained from sparse annotations on point cloud features, we propose a multi-modal weakly supervised network for LiDAR semantic segmentation, called MM-ScatterNet. This network combines features from both point cloud and image modalities, enhancing the representation learning of point clouds by introducing consistency constraints between multi-modal features and point cloud features. On the SemanticKITTI dataset, we achieve 66\% of fully supervised performance using only 0.02% of annotated data, and on the NuScenes dataset, we achieve 95% of fully supervised performance using only 0.1% labeled points.</p></details> |  |

In such tasks, selecting the right target to pick is as essential as inferring a correct configuration of the gripper. A common solution to this problem relies on semantic segmentation models, which often show poor generalization to unseen objects and require considerable time and massive data to be trained. To reduce the need for large datasets, some grasping pipelines exploit few-shot semantic segmentation models, which are capable of recognizing new classes given a few examples. However, this often comes at the cost of limited performance and fine-tuning is required to be effective in robot grasping scenarios. In this work, we propose to overcome all these limitations by combining the impressive generalization capability reached by foundation models with a high-performing few-shot classifier, working as a score function to select the segmentation that is closer to the support set. The proposed model is designed to be embedded in a grasp synthesis pipeline. The extensive experiments using one or five examples show that our novel approach overcomes existing performance limitations, improving the state of the art both in few-shot semantic segmentation on the Graspnet-1B (+10.5% mIoU) and Ocid-grasp (+1.6% AP) datasets, and real-world few-shot grasp synthesis (+21.7% grasp accuracy).

Recent studies have explored its potential for estimating lowest floor elevation (LFE), offering a scalable alternative to traditional on-site measurements, crucial for assessing properties' flood risk and damage extent. While existing methods rely on object detection, the introduction of image segmentation has broadened street view images' utility for LFE estimation, although challenges still remain in segmentation quality and capability to distinguish front doors from other doors. To address these challenges in LFE estimation, this study integrates the Segment Anything model, a segmentation foundation model, with vision language models to conduct text-prompt image segmentation on street view images for LFE estimation. By evaluating various vision language models, integration methods, and text prompts, we identify the most suitable model for street view image analytics and LFE estimation tasks, thereby improving the availability of the current LFE estimation model based on image segmentation from 33% to 56% of properties. Remarkably, our proposed method significantly enhances the availability of LFE estimation to almost all properties in which the front door is visible in the street view image. Also the findings present the first baseline and comparison of various vision models of street view image-based LFE estimation. The model and findings not only contribute to advancing street view image segmentation for urban analytics but also provide a novel approach for image segmentation tasks for other civil engineering and infrastructure analytics tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Benchmark Vision Foundation Models for Semantic Segmentation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12172v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated proficiency in various tasks but require supervised fine-tuning to perform the task of semantic segmentation effectively. Benchmarking their performance is essential for selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this task. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked for semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various settings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and training time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to fine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear decoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more advanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more than 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also recommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts varies. Linear probing, a common practice for some VFMs, is not recommended, as it is not representative of end-to-end fine-tuning. The benchmarking setup recommended in this paper enables a performance analysis of VFMs for semantic segmentation. The findings of such an analysis reveal that pretraining with promptable segmentation is not beneficial, whereas masked image modeling (MIM) with abstract representations is crucial, even more important than the type of supervision used.

The lack of human-annotated multi-modality aesthetic data further exacerbates this dilemma, resulting in MLLMs falling short of aesthetics perception capabilities. To address the above challenge, we first introduce a comprehensively annotated Aesthetic Multi-Modality Instruction Tuning (AesMMIT) dataset, which serves as the footstone for building multi-modality aesthetics foundation models. Specifically, to align MLLMs with human aesthetics perception, we construct a corpus-rich aesthetic critique database with 21,904 diverse-sourced images and 88K human natural language feedbacks, which are collected via progressive questions, ranging from coarse-grained aesthetic grades to fine-grained aesthetic descriptions. To ensure that MLLMs can handle diverse queries, we further prompt GPT to refine the aesthetic critiques and assemble the large-scale aesthetic instruction tuning dataset, i.e. AesMMIT, which consists of 409K multi-typed instructions to activate stronger aesthetic capabilities. Based on the AesMMIT database, we fine-tune the open-sourced general foundation models, achieving multi-modality Aesthetic Expert models, dubbed AesExpert. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed AesExpert models deliver significantly better aesthetic perception performances than the state-of-the-art MLLMs, including the most advanced GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro-Vision.

Driven by the motivation that Leveraging Stronger pre-trained models and Fewer trainable parameters for Superior generalizability, we introduce a robust fine-tuning approach, namely Rein, to parameter-efficiently harness VFMs for DGSS. Built upon a set of trainable tokens, each linked to distinct instances, Rein precisely refines and forwards the feature maps from each layer to the next layer within the backbone. This process produces diverse refinements for different categories within a single image. With fewer trainable parameters, Rein efficiently fine-tunes VFMs for DGSS tasks, surprisingly surpassing full parameter fine-tuning. Extensive experiments across various settings demonstrate that Rein significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Remarkably, with just an extra 1% of trainable parameters within the frozen backbone, Rein achieves a mIoU of 78.4% on the Cityscapes, without accessing any real urban-scene datasets.Code is available at https://github.com/w1oves/Rein.git.</p></details> |  |

However, in object detection and instance segmentation, two fundamental computer vision tasks heavily reliant on extensive human annotations, foundation models such as SAM and DINO struggle to achieve satisfactory performance. In this study, we reveal that the devil is in the object boundary, \textit{i.e.}, these foundation models fail to discern boundaries between individual objects. For the first time, we probe that CLIP, which has never accessed any instance-level annotations, can provide a highly beneficial and strong instance-level boundary prior in the clustering results of its particular intermediate layer. Following this surprising observation, we propose $\textbf{Zip}$ which $\textbf{Z}$ips up CL$\textbf{ip}$ and SAM in a novel classification-first-then-discovery pipeline, enabling annotation-free, complex-scene-capable, open-vocabulary object detection and instance segmentation. Our Zip significantly boosts SAM's mask AP on COCO dataset by 12.5% and establishes state-of-the-art performance in various settings, including training-free, self-training, and label-efficient finetuning.

Understanding the Suitability for Pixel-Level Classification Using Multispectral Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11797v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, i.e., very large deep learning models, have demonstrated impressive performances in various language and vision tasks that are otherwise difficult to reach using smaller-size models. The major success of GPT-type of language models is particularly exciting and raises expectations on the potential of foundation models in other domains including satellite remote sensing. In this context, great efforts have been made to build foundation models to test their capabilities in broader applications, and examples include Prithvi by NASA-IBM, Segment-Anything-Model, ViT, etc. This leads to an important question: Are foundation models always a suitable choice for different remote sensing tasks, and when or when not? This work aims to enhance the understanding of the status and suitability of foundation models for pixel-level classification using multispectral imagery at moderate resolution, through comparisons with traditional machine learning (ML) and regular-size deep learning models. Interestingly, the results reveal that in many scenarios traditional ML models still have similar or better performance compared to foundation models, especially for tasks where texture is less useful for classification. On the other hand, deep learning models did show more promising results for tasks where labels partially depend on texture (e.g., burn scar), while the difference in performance between foundation models and deep learning models is not obvious. The results conform with our analysis: The suitability of foundation models depend on the alignment between the self-supervised learning tasks and the real downstream tasks, and the typical masked autoencoder paradigm is not necessarily suitable for many remote sensing problems.</p></details> |  |
