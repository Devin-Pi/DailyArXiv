| **[A Spatial-statistical model to analyse historical rutting data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03633v3)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pavement rutting poses a significant challenge in flexible pavements, necessitating costly asphalt resurfacing. To address this issue comprehensively, we propose an advanced Bayesian hierarchical framework of latent Gaussian models with spatial components. Our model provides a thorough diagnostic analysis, pinpointing areas exhibiting unexpectedly high rutting rates. Incorporating spatial and random components, and important explanatory variables like annual average daily traffic (traffic intensity), asphalt type, rut depth and lane width, our proposed models account for and estimate the influence of these variables on rutting. This approach not only quantifies uncertainties and discerns locations at the highest risk of requiring maintenance, but also uncover spatial dependencies in rutting (millimetre/year). We apply our models to a data set spanning eleven years (2010-2020). Our findings emphasise the systematic unexplained spatial rutting effect, where some of the rutting variability is accounted for by spatial components, asphalt type, in conjunction with traffic intensity, is also found to be the primary driver of rutting. Furthermore, the spatial dependencies uncovered reveal road sections experiencing more than 1 millimeter of rutting beyond annual expectations. This leads to a halving of the expected pavement lifespan in these areas. Our study offers valuable insights, presenting maps indicating expected rutting, and identifying locations with accelerated rutting rates, resulting in a reduction in pavement life expectancy of at least 10 years.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 5 figures and 3 tables in main text, 2 tables and 4 figures in appendix 4 figures; and 3 tables in supplementary</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Spatial-Temporal Normality Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19770v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time Series Anomaly Detection (TSAD) finds widespread applications across various domains such as financial markets, industrial production, and healthcare. Its primary objective is to learn the normal patterns of time series data, thereby identifying deviations in test samples. Most existing TSAD methods focus on modeling data from the temporal dimension, while ignoring the semantic information in the spatial dimension. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach, called Spatial-Temporal Normality learning (STEN). STEN is composed of a sequence Order prediction-based Temporal Normality learning (OTN) module that captures the temporal correlations within sequences, and a Distance prediction-based Spatial Normality learning (DSN) module that learns the relative spatial relations between sequences in a feature space. By synthesizing these two modules, STEN learns expressive spatial-temporal representations for the normal patterns hidden in the time series data. Extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks show that STEN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/STEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted in ECML PKDD2024</p></details> |
| **[SPIRONet: Spatial-Frequency Learning and Topological Channel Interaction Network for Vessel Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19749v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic vessel segmentation is paramount for developing next-generation interventional navigation systems. However, current approaches suffer from suboptimal segmentation performances due to significant challenges in intraoperative images (i.e., low signal-to-noise ratio, small or slender vessels, and strong interference). In this paper, a novel spatial-frequency learning and topological channel interaction network (SPIRONet) is proposed to address the above issues. Specifically, dual encoders are utilized to comprehensively capture local spatial and global frequency vessel features. Then, a cross-attention fusion module is introduced to effectively fuse spatial and frequency features, thereby enhancing feature discriminability. Furthermore, a topological channel interaction module is designed to filter out task-irrelevant responses based on graph neural networks. Extensive experimental results on several challenging datasets (CADSA, CAXF, DCA1, and XCAD) demonstrate state-of-the-art performances of our method. Moreover, the inference speed of SPIRONet is 21 FPS with a 512x512 input size, surpassing clinical real-time requirements (6~12FPS). These promising outcomes indicate SPIRONet's potential for integration into vascular interventional navigation systems. Code is available at https://github.com/Dxhuang-CASIA/SPIRONet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Assessment of Sentinel-2 spatial and temporal coverage based on the scene classification layer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18584v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the launch of the Sentinel-2 (S2) satellites, many ML models have used the data for diverse applications. The scene classification layer (SCL) inside the S2 product provides rich information for training, such as filtering images with high cloud coverage. However, there is more potential in this. We propose a technique to assess the clean optical coverage of a region, expressed by a SITS and calculated with the S2-based SCL data. With a manual threshold and specific labels in the SCL, the proposed technique assigns a percentage of spatial and temporal coverage across the time series and a high/low assessment. By evaluating the AI4EO challenge for Enhanced Agriculture, we show that the assessment is correlated to the predictive results of ML models. The classification results in a region with low spatial and temporal coverage is worse than in a region with high coverage. Finally, we applied the technique across all continents of the global dataset LandCoverNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2024</p></details> |
| **[Mixture of Directed Graphical Models for Discrete Spatial Random Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15700v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current approaches for modeling discrete-valued outcomes associated with spatially-dependent areal units incur computational and theoretical challenges, especially in the Bayesian setting when full posterior inference is desired. As an alternative, we propose a novel statistical modeling framework for this data setting, namely a mixture of directed graphical models (MDGMs). The components of the mixture, directed graphical models, can be represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and are computationally quick to evaluate. The DAGs representing the mixture components are selected to correspond to an undirected graphical representation of an assumed spatial contiguity/dependence structure of the areal units, which underlies the specification of traditional modeling approaches for discrete spatial processes such as Markov random fields (MRFs). We introduce the concept of compatibility to show how an undirected graph can be used as a template for the structural dependencies between areal units to create sets of DAGs which, as a collection, preserve the structural dependencies represented in the template undirected graph. We then introduce three classes of compatible DAGs and corresponding algorithms for fitting MDGMs based on these classes. In addition, we compare MDGMs to MRFs and a popular Bayesian MRF model approximation used in high-dimensional settings in a series of simulations and an analysis of ecometrics data collected as part of the Adolescent Health and Development in Context Study.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpatialBot: Precise Spatial Understanding with Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13642v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in 2D image understanding, however they are still struggling with spatial understanding which is the foundation of Embodied AI. In this paper, we propose SpatialBot for better spatial understanding by feeding both RGB and depth images. Additionally, we have constructed the SpatialQA dataset, which involves multi-level depth-related questions to train VLMs for depth understanding. Finally, we present SpatialBench to comprehensively evaluate VLMs' capabilities in spatial understanding at different levels. Extensive experiments on our spatial-understanding benchmark, general VLM benchmarks and Embodied AI tasks, demonstrate the remarkable improvements of SpatialBot trained on SpatialQA.

| **[SRC-Net: Bi-Temporal Spatial Relationship Concerned Network for Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05668v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection (CD) in remote sensing imagery is a crucial task with applications in environmental monitoring, urban development, and disaster management. CD involves utilizing bi-temporal images to identify changes over time. The bi-temporal spatial relationships between features at the same location at different times play a key role in this process. However, existing change detection networks often do not fully leverage these spatial relationships during bi-temporal feature extraction and fusion. In this work, we propose SRC-Net: a bi-temporal spatial relationship concerned network for CD. The proposed SRC-Net includes a Perception and Interaction Module that incorporates spatial relationships and establishes a cross-branch perception mechanism to enhance the precision and robustness of feature extraction. Additionally, a Patch-Mode joint Feature Fusion Module is introduced to address information loss in current methods. It considers different change modes and concerns about spatial relationships, resulting in more expressive fusion features. Furthermore, we construct a novel network using these two relationship concerned modules and conducted experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU Building datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while maintaining a modest parameter count. We believe our approach sets a new paradigm for change detection and will inspire further advancements in the field. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/Chnja/SRCNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Multiplexing in Near-Field Line-of-Sight MIMO Communications: Paraxial and Non-Paraxial Deployments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19084v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sixth generation (6G) wireless networks are envisioned to include aspects of energy footprint reduction (sustainability), besides those of network capacity and connectivity, at the design stage. This paradigm change requires radically new physical layer technologies. Notably, the integration of large-aperture arrays and the transmission over high frequency bands, such as the sub-terahertz spectrum, are two promising options. In many communication scenarios of practical interest, the use of large antenna arrays in the sub-terahertz frequency range often results in short-range transmission distances that are characterized by line-of-sight channels, in which pairs of transmitters and receivers are located in the (radiating) near field of one another. These features make the traditional designs, based on the far-field approximation, for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems sub-optimal in terms of spatial multiplexing gains. To overcome these limitations, new designs for MIMO systems are required, which account for the spherical wavefront that characterizes the electromagnetic waves in the near field, in order to ensure the highest spatial multiplexing gain without increasing the power expenditure. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework for optimizing the deployment of antenna arrays in line-of-sight channels, which can be applied to paraxial and non-paraxial network deployments. In the paraxial setting, we devise a simpler analytical framework, which, compared to those available in the literature, provides explicit information about the impact of key design parameters. In the non-paraxial setting, we introduce a novel analytical framework that allows us to identify a set of sufficient conditions to be fulfilled for achieving the highest spatial multiplexing gain. The proposed designs are validated with numerical simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted in IEEE Transactions on Green Communications and Networking</p></details> |
| **[BiCo-Fusion: Bidirectional Complementary LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Semantic- and Spatial-Aware 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19048v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection is an important task that has been widely applied in autonomous driving. Recently, fusing multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera data, to perform this task has become a new trend. Existing methods, however, either ignore the sparsity of Lidar features or fail to preserve the original spatial structure of LiDAR and the semantic density of camera features simultaneously due to the modality gap. To address issues, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary Lidar-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to mutually fuse the multi-modal features to enhance the semantics of LiDAR features and the spatial awareness of the camera features and adaptatively select features from both modalities to build a unified 3D representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantics of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the spatial characteristics of camera features from 3D voxel features. Both VEM and IEM are bidirectionally updated to effectively reduce the modality gap. We then introduce Unified Fusion to adaptively weight to select features from the enchanted Lidar and camera features to build a unified 3D representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts. Project page: https://t-ys.github.io/BiCo-Fusion/.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[MMR-Mamba: Multi-Contrast MRI Reconstruction with Mamba and Spatial-Frequency Information Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18950v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-contrast MRI acceleration has become prevalent in MR imaging, enabling the reconstruction of high-quality MR images from under-sampled k-space data of the target modality, using guidance from a fully-sampled auxiliary modality. The main crux lies in efficiently and comprehensively integrating complementary information from the auxiliary modality. Existing methods either suffer from quadratic computational complexity or fail to capture long-range correlated features comprehensively. In this work, we propose MMR-Mamba, a novel framework that achieves comprehensive integration of multi-contrast features through Mamba and spatial-frequency information fusion. Firstly, we design the \textit{Target modality-guided Cross Mamba} (TCM) module in the spatial domain, which maximally restores the target modality information by selectively absorbing useful information from the auxiliary modality. Secondly, leveraging global properties of the Fourier domain, we introduce the \textit{Selective Frequency Fusion} (SFF) module to efficiently integrate global information in the frequency domain and recover high-frequency signals for the reconstruction of structure details. Additionally, we present the \textit{Adaptive Spatial-Frequency Fusion} (ASFF) module, which enhances fused features by supplementing less informative features from one domain with corresponding features from the other domain. These innovative strategies ensure efficient feature fusion across spatial and frequency domains, avoiding the introduction of redundant information and facilitating the reconstruction of high-quality target images. Extensive experiments on the BraTS and fastMRI knee datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed MMR-Mamba over state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figure |
| **[Semi-Parametric Inference for Doubly Stochastic Spatial Point Processes: An Approximate Penalized Poisson Likelihood Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06756v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Doubly-stochastic point processes model the occurrence of events over a spatial domain as an inhomogeneous Poisson process conditioned on the realization of a random intensity function. They are flexible tools for capturing spatial heterogeneity and dependence. However, existing implementations of doubly-stochastic spatial models are computationally demanding, often have limited theoretical guarantee, and/or rely on restrictive assumptions. We propose a penalized regression method for estimating covariate effects in doubly-stochastic point processes that is computationally efficient and does not require a parametric form or stationarity of the underlying intensity. Our approach is based on an approximate (discrete and deterministic) formulation of the true (continuous and stochastic) intensity function. We show that consistency and asymptotic normality of the covariate effect estimates can be achieved despite the model misspecification, and develop a covariance estimator that leads to a valid, albeit conservative, statistical inference procedure. A simulation study shows the validity of our approach under less restrictive assumptions on the data generating mechanism, and an application to Seattle crime data demonstrates better prediction accuracy compared with existing alternatives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retain, Blend, and Exchange: A Quality-aware Spatial-Stereo Fusion Approach for Event Stream Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18845v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing event stream-based pattern recognition models usually represent the event stream as the point cloud, voxel, image, etc., and design various deep neural networks to learn their features. Although considerable results can be achieved in simple cases, however, the model performance may be limited by monotonous modality expressions, sub-optimal fusion, and readout mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-stream framework for event stream-based pattern recognition via differentiated fusion, termed EFV++. It models two common event representations simultaneously, i.e., event images and event voxels. The spatial and three-dimensional stereo information can be learned separately by utilizing Transformer and Graph Neural Network (GNN). We believe the features of each representation still contain both efficient and redundant features and a sub-optimal solution may be obtained if we directly fuse them without differentiation. Thus, we divide each feature into three levels and retain high-quality features, blend medium-quality features, and exchange low-quality features. The enhanced dual features will be fed into the fusion Transformer together with bottleneck features. In addition, we introduce a novel hybrid interaction readout mechanism to enhance the diversity of features as final representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used event stream-based classification datasets. Specifically, we achieve new state-of-the-art performance on the Bullying10k dataset, i.e., $90.51\%$, which exceeds the second place by $+2.21\%$.

| **[Spatial-temporal Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Interpretable Pathology Image Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18310v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology image are essential for accurately interpreting lesion cells in cytopathology screening, but acquiring high-resolution digital slides requires specialized equipment and long scanning times. Though super-resolution (SR) techniques can alleviate this problem, existing deep learning models recover pathology image in a black-box manner, which can lead to untruthful biological details and misdiagnosis. Additionally, current methods allocate the same computational resources to recover each pixel of pathology image, leading to the sub-optimal recovery issue due to the large variation of pathology image. In this paper, we propose the first hierarchical reinforcement learning framework named Spatial-Temporal hierARchical Reinforcement Learning (STAR-RL), mainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in pathology image super-resolution problem. We reformulate the SR problem as a Markov decision process of interpretable operations and adopt the hierarchical recovery mechanism in patch level, to avoid sub-optimal recovery. Specifically, the higher-level spatial manager is proposed to pick out the most corrupted patch for the lower-level patch worker. Moreover, the higher-level temporal manager is advanced to evaluate the selected patch and determine whether the optimization should be stopped earlier, thereby avoiding the over-processed problem. Under the guidance of spatial-temporal managers, the lower-level patch worker processes the selected patch with pixel-wise interpretable actions at each time step. Experimental results on medical images degraded by different kernels show the effectiveness of STAR-RL. Furthermore, STAR-RL validates the promotion in tumor diagnosis with a large margin and shows generalizability under various degradations.

| **[Human-Aware 3D Scene Generation with Spatially-constrained Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18159v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating 3D scenes from human motion sequences supports numerous applications, including virtual reality and architectural design. However, previous auto-regression-based human-aware 3D scene generation methods have struggled to accurately capture the joint distribution of multiple objects and input humans, often resulting in overlapping object generation in the same space. To address this limitation, we explore the potential of diffusion models that simultaneously consider all input humans and the floor plan to generate plausible 3D scenes. Our approach not only satisfies all input human interactions but also adheres to spatial constraints with the floor plan. Furthermore, we introduce two spatial collision guidance mechanisms: human-object collision avoidance and object-room boundary constraints. These mechanisms help avoid generating scenes that conflict with human motions while respecting layout constraints. To enhance the diversity and accuracy of human-guided scene generation, we have developed an automated pipeline that improves the variety and plausibility of human-object interactions in the existing 3D FRONT HUMAN dataset. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework can generate more natural and plausible 3D scenes with precise human-scene interactions, while significantly reducing human-object collisions compared to previous state-of-the-art methods. Our code and data will be made publicly available upon publication of this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[RGB-Sonar Tracking Benchmark and Spatial Cross-Attention Transformer Tracker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07189v3)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision camera and sonar are naturally complementary in the underwater environment. Combining the information from two modalities will promote better observation of underwater targets. However, this problem has not received sufficient attention in previous research. Therefore, this paper introduces a new challenging RGB-Sonar (RGB-S) tracking task and investigates how to achieve efficient tracking of an underwater target through the interaction of RGB and sonar modalities. Specifically, we first propose an RGBS50 benchmark dataset containing 50 sequences and more than 87000 high-quality annotated bounding boxes. Experimental results show that the RGBS50 benchmark poses a challenge to currently popular SOT trackers. Second, we propose an RGB-S tracker called SCANet, which includes a spatial cross-attention module (SCAM) consisting of a novel spatial cross-attention layer and two independent global integration modules. The spatial cross-attention is used to overcome the problem of spatial misalignment of between RGB and sonar images. Third, we propose a SOT data-based RGB-S simulation training method (SRST) to overcome the lack of RGB-S training datasets. It converts RGB images into sonar-like saliency images to construct pseudo-data pairs, enabling the model to learn the semantic structure of RGB-S-like data. Comprehensive experiments show that the proposed spatial cross-attention effectively achieves the interaction between RGB and sonar modalities and SCANet achieves state-of-the-art performance on the proposed benchmark. The code is available at https://github.com/LiYunfengLYF/RGBS50.</p></details> |  |
| **[Socio-spatial segregation and human mobility: A review of empirical evidence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06641v3)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social segregation, the spatial and social separation between individuals from different backgrounds, can affect sustainable urban development and social cohesion. The literature has traditionally focused on residential segregation, examining how individuals' residential locations are distributed differently across neighborhoods based on income, ethnicity, and education. However, this approach overlooks the complexity of spatial segregation because daily activities often extend far beyond residential areas. Since the 2010s, emerging mobility data sources have enabled a new understanding of socio-spatial segregation by considering daily activities such as work, school, shopping, and leisure visits. From traditional surveys to GPS trajectories, diverse data sources reveal that day-to-day mobility can impact segregation by reducing or amplifying segregation levels obtained when considering residential aspects alone. This literature review focuses on three critical questions: (a) How do human mobility patterns relate to individuals' segregation experiences? (b) What key factors explain the relationship between one's mobility patterns and segregation experiences? and (c) What are the strengths and limitations of segregation research that incorporates extensive mobility data? Our literature review enhances the understanding of socio-spatial segregation at the individual level and clarifies core concepts and methodological challenges in the field. By incorporating studies from computational social science, urban science, and transportation, our review aims to provide actionable insights for reducing segregation and addressing research gaps in this increasingly interdisciplinary area.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel machine learning (ML) framework that integrates spatial extreme-value theory to model weather extremes and to quantify probabilities associated with the occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of these events. Our approach employs new loss functions adapted to extreme values, enabling our model to prioritize the tail instead of the bulk of the data distribution. Applied to a case study of Western European summertime heat extremes, we use daily 500-hPa geopotential height fields and local soil moisture as predictors to capture the complex interplay between local and remote physical processes. Our generative model reveals the importance of individual circulation features in determining different facets of heat extremes, thereby enriching our process understanding from a data-driven perspective. The occurrence, intensity, and spatial extent of heat extremes are sensitive to the relative position of upper-level ridges and troughs that are part of a large-scale wave pattern. Our approach is able to extrapolate beyond the range of the data to make risk-related probabilistic statements, applies more generally to other weather extremes, and offers an attractive alternative to traditional physical and ML-based techniques that focus less on the extremal aspects of weather data.</p></details> |  |

Traditional voice conversion methods focus on single-channel waveforms, ignoring the stereo listening experience inherent in human hearing. Our baseline approach addresses this gap by integrating blind source separation (BSS), voice conversion (VC), and spatial mixing to handle multi-channel waveforms. Through experimental evaluations, we organize and identify the key challenges inherent in this task, such as maintaining audio quality and accurately preserving spatial information. Our results highlight the fundamental difficulties in balancing these aspects, providing a benchmark for future research in spatial voice conversion. The proposed method's code is publicly available to encourage further exploration in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Interspeech 2024</p></details> |
| **[Supervised learning of spatial features with STDP and homeostasis using Spiking Neural Networks on SpiNNaker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02659v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have gained significant popularity thanks to their ability to learn using the well-known backpropagation algorithm. Conversely, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), despite having broader capabilities than ANNs, have always posed challenges in the training phase. This paper shows a new method to perform supervised learning on SNNs, using Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) and homeostasis, aiming at training the network to identify spatial patterns. Spatial patterns refer to spike patterns without a time component, where all spike events occur simultaneously. The method is tested using the SpiNNaker digital architecture. A SNN is trained to recognise one or multiple patterns and performance metrics are extracted to measure the performance of the network. Some considerations are drawn from the results showing that, in the case of a single trained pattern, the network behaves as the ideal detector, with 100% accuracy in detecting the trained pattern. However, as the number of trained patterns on a single network increases, the accuracy of identification is linked to the similarities between these patterns. This method of training an SNN to detect spatial patterns may be applied to pattern recognition in static images or traffic analysis in computer networks, where each network packet represents a spatial pattern. It will be stipulated that the homeostatic factor may enable the network to detect patterns with some degree of similarity, rather than only perfectly matching patterns.The principles outlined in this article serve as the fundamental building blocks for more complex systems that utilise both spatial and temporal patterns by converting specific features of input signals into spikes.One example of such a system is a computer network packet classifier, tasked with real-time identification of packet streams based on features within the packet content</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 6 figures (figure 6 has 9 sub-figures) for a total of 14 images, 10 tables, submitted to the Journal of Neural Networks</p></details> |
| **[Spatially Structured Regression for Non-conformable Spaces: Integrating Pathology Imaging and Genomics Data in Cancer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16721v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial composition and cellular heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment plays a critical role in cancer development and progression. High-definition pathology imaging of tumor biopsies provide a high-resolution view of the spatial organization of different types of cells. This allows for systematic assessment of intra- and inter-patient spatial cellular interactions and heterogeneity by integrating accompanying patient-level genomics data. However, joint modeling across tumor biopsies presents unique challenges due to non-conformability (lack of a common spatial domain across biopsies) as well as high-dimensionality. To address this problem, we propose the Dual random effect and main effect selection model for Spatially structured regression model (DreameSpase). DreameSpase employs a Bayesian variable selection framework that facilitates the assessment of spatial heterogeneity with respect to covariates both within (through fixed effects) and between spaces (through spatial random effects) for non-conformable spatial domains. We demonstrate the efficacy of DreameSpase via simulations and integrative analyses of pathology imaging and gene expression data obtained from $335$ melanoma biopsies. Our findings confirm several existing relationships, e.g. neutrophil genes being associated with both inter- and intra-patient spatial heterogeneity, as well as discovering novel associations. We also provide freely available and computationally efficient software for implementing DreameSpase.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024; V2 adds new experiments</p></details> |
| **[Pareto Adversarial Robustness: Balancing Spatial Robustness and Sensitivity-based Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.01996v3)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial robustness, which primarily comprises sensitivity-based robustness and spatial robustness, plays an integral part in achieving robust generalization. In this paper, we endeavor to design strategies to achieve universal adversarial robustness. To achieve this, we first investigate the relatively less-explored realm of spatial robustness. Then, we integrate the existing spatial robustness methods by incorporating both local and global spatial vulnerability into a unified spatial attack and adversarial training approach. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive relationship between natural accuracy, sensitivity-based robustness, and spatial robustness, supported by strong evidence from the perspective of robust representation. Crucially, to reconcile the interplay between the mutual impacts of various robustness components into one unified framework, we incorporate the \textit{Pareto criterion} into the adversarial robustness analysis, yielding a novel strategy called Pareto Adversarial Training for achieving universal robustness. The resulting Pareto front, which delineates the set of optimal solutions, provides an optimal balance between natural accuracy and various adversarial robustness. This sheds light on solutions for achieving universal robustness in the future. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to consider universal adversarial robustness via multi-objective optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences (SCIS) in 2023.

However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs) encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,108 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and metadata. HEST-1k was assembled using HEST-Library from 131 public and internal cohorts encompassing 25 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 320 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 1.5 million expression--morphology pairs and 60 million nuclei. HEST-1k is tested on three use cases: (1) benchmarking foundation models for histopathology (HEST-Benchmark), (2) biomarker identification, and (3) multimodal representation learning. HEST-1k, HEST-Library, and HEST-Benchmark can be freely accessed via https://github.com/mahmoodlab/hest.</p></details> | Under review |

Transfer learning models can be leveraged to solve this problem, as they use alternate data sources to gain knowledge (i.e., data from data-rich regions). However, current transfer learning methodologies do not account for dependencies between the source and the target domains. We recognize this transfer problem as spatial transfer learning and propose a new feature named Latent Dependency Factor (LDF) that captures spatial and semantic dependencies of both domains and is subsequently added to the feature spaces of the domains. We generate LDF using a novel two-stage autoencoder model that learns from clusters of similar source and target domain data. Our experiments show that transfer learning models using LDF have a 19.34% improvement over the baselines. We additionally support our experiments with qualitative findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ECML-PKDD 2024</p></details> |

Learning good spatial representations is a fundamental problem for various downstream applications such as species distribution modeling, weather forecasting, trajectory generation, geographic question answering, etc. Even though SRL has become the foundation of almost all geospatial artificial intelligence (GeoAI) research, we have not yet seen significant efforts to develop an extensive deep learning framework and benchmark to support SRL model development and evaluation. To fill this gap, we propose TorchSpatial, a learning framework and benchmark for location (point) encoding, which is one of the most fundamental data types of spatial representation learning. TorchSpatial contains three key components: 1) a unified location encoding framework that consolidates 15 commonly recognized location encoders, ensuring scalability and reproducibility of the implementations; 2) the LocBench benchmark tasks encompassing 7 geo-aware image classification and 4 geo-aware image regression datasets; 3) a comprehensive suite of evaluation metrics to quantify geo-aware models' overall performance as well as their geographic bias, with a novel Geo-Bias Score metric. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis and insights into the model performance and geographic bias of different location encoders. We believe TorchSpatial will foster future advancement of spatial representation learning and spatial fairness in GeoAI research. The TorchSpatial model framework, LocBench, and Geo-Bias Score evaluation framework are available at https://github.com/seai-lab/TorchSpatial.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures.

Spatial confounding is thought to occur when there is multicollinearity between a covariate and the random effect in a spatial regression model. This multicollinearity is considered highly problematic when the inferential goal is estimating regression coefficients and various methodologies have been proposed to attempt to alleviate it. Recently, it has become apparent that many of these methodologies are flawed, yet the field continues to expand. In this paper, we offer a novel perspective of synthesizing the work in the field of spatial confounding. We propose that at least two distinct phenomena are currently conflated with the term spatial confounding. We refer to these as the ``analysis model'' and the ``data generation'' types of spatial confounding. We show that these two issues can lead to contradicting conclusions about whether spatial confounding exists and whether methods to alleviate it will improve inference. Our results also illustrate that in most cases, traditional spatial linear mixed models do help to improve inference on regression coefficients. Drawing on the insights gained, we offer a path forward for research in spatial confounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages main text; 8 figures; code available upon request</p></details> |
| **[Is A Picture Worth A Thousand Words? Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14852v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning -- a fundamental component of human cognition -- remains under-explored. We develop novel benchmarks that cover diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Path-planning from Speech Instructions with Spatial Concept-based Topometric Semantic Mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10820v3)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assisting individuals in their daily activities through autonomous mobile robots, especially for users without specialized knowledge, is crucial. Specifically, the capability of robots to navigate to destinations based on human speech instructions is essential. While robots can take different paths to the same goal, the shortest path is not always the best. A preferred approach is to accommodate waypoint specifications flexibly, planning an improved alternative path, even with detours. Additionally, robots require real-time inference capabilities. This study aimed to realize a hierarchical spatial representation using a topometric semantic map and path planning with speech instructions, including waypoints. This paper presents Spatial Concept-based Topometric Semantic Mapping for Hierarchical Path Planning (SpCoTMHP), integrating place connectivity. This approach offers a novel integrated probabilistic generative model and fast approximate inference across hierarchy levels. A formulation based on control as probabilistic inference theoretically supports the proposed path planning algorithm. We conducted experiments in home environments using the Toyota Human Support Robot on the SIGVerse simulator and in a lab-office environment with the real robot, Albert. Users issued speech commands specifying the waypoint and goal, such as "Go to the bedroom via the corridor." Navigation experiments using speech instructions with a waypoint demonstrated a performance improvement of SpCoTMHP over the baseline hierarchical path planning method with heuristic path costs (HPP-I), in terms of the weighted success rate at which the robot reaches the closest target and passes the correct waypoints, by 0.590. The computation time was significantly accelerated by 7.14 seconds with SpCoTMHP compared to baseline HPP-I in advanced tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Frontiers in Robotics and AI</p></details> |

We use the setting of spatially invariant systems as an idealization for which concrete and detailed results are given. Such estimators are known to have a degree of spatial localization in the sense that the estimator gains decay in space, with the spatial decay rates serving as a proxy for how far measurements need to be shared in an optimal distributed estimator. In particular, we examine the dependence of spatial decay rates on problem specifications such as system dynamics, measurement and process noise variances, as well as their spatial autocorrelations. We propose non-dimensional parameters that characterize the decay rates as a function of problem specifications. In particular, we find an interesting matching condition between the characteristic lengthscale of the dynamics and the measurement noise correlation lengthscale for which the optimal centralized estimator is completely decentralized. A new technique - termed the branch point locus - is introduced to quantify spatial decay rates in terms of analyticity regions in the complex spatial frequency plane. Our results are illustrated through two case studies of systems with dynamics modeled by diffusion and the Swift-Hohenberg equation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[STimage-1K4M: A histopathology image-gene expression dataset for spatial transcriptomics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06393v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multi-modal algorithms have driven and been driven by the increasing availability of large image-text datasets, leading to significant strides in various fields, including computational pathology. However, in most existing medical image-text datasets, the text typically provides high-level summaries that may not sufficiently describe sub-tile regions within a large pathology image. For example, an image might cover an extensive tissue area containing cancerous and healthy regions, but the accompanying text might only specify that this image is a cancer slide, lacking the nuanced details needed for in-depth analysis. In this study, we introduce STimage-1K4M, a novel dataset designed to bridge this gap by providing genomic features for sub-tile images. STimage-1K4M contains 1,149 images derived from spatial transcriptomics data, which captures gene expression information at the level of individual spatial spots within a pathology image. Specifically, each image in the dataset is broken down into smaller sub-image tiles, with each tile paired with 15,000-30,000 dimensional gene expressions. With 4,293,195 pairs of sub-tile images and gene expressions, STimage-1K4M offers unprecedented granularity, paving the way for a wide range of advanced research in multi-modal data analysis an innovative applications in computational pathology, and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[The neural correlates of logical-mathematical symbol systems processing resemble that of spatial cognition more than natural language processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14358v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to manipulate logical-mathematical symbols (LMS), encompassing tasks such as calculation, reasoning, and programming, is a cognitive skill arguably unique to humans. Considering the relatively recent emergence of this ability in human evolutionary history, it has been suggested that LMS processing may build upon more fundamental cognitive systems, possibly through neuronal recycling. Previous studies have pinpointed two primary candidates, natural language processing and spatial cognition. Existing comparisons between these domains largely relied on task-level comparison, which may be confounded by task idiosyncrasy. The present study instead compared the neural correlates at the domain level with both automated meta-analysis and synthesized maps based on three representative LMS tasks, reasoning, calculation, and mental programming. Our results revealed a more substantial cortical overlap between LMS processing and spatial cognition, in contrast to language processing. Furthermore, in regions activated by both spatial and language processing, the multivariate activation pattern for LMS processing exhibited greater multivariate similarity to spatial cognition than to language processing. A hierarchical clustering analysis further indicated that typical LMS tasks were indistinguishable from spatial cognition tasks at the neural level, suggesting an inherent connection between these two cognitive processes. Taken together, our findings support the hypothesis that spatial cognition is likely the basis of LMS processing, which may shed light on the limitations of large language models in logical reasoning, particularly those trained exclusively on textual data without explicit emphasis on spatial content.</p></details> |  |

The proposed work addresses this challenge within the context of the English Lake District, employing the Corpus of the Lake District Writing. The method utilizes a generative pre-trained transformer model to extract spatial relations from the textual descriptions in the corpus. The study applies this large language model to understand the spatial dimensions inherent in historical narratives comprehensively. The outcomes are presented as semantic triples, capturing the nuanced connections between entities and locations, and visualized as a network, offering a graphical representation of the spatial narrative. The study contributes to a deeper comprehension of the English Lake District's spatial tapestry and provides an approach to uncovering spatial relations within diverse historical contexts.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present EMUSES (Emerging-properties Mapping Using Spatial Embedding Statistics), an innovative approach employing Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to create high-dimensional embeddings that reveal latent structures within data. EMUSES facilitates the exploration and prediction of emergent properties by statistically analyzing these latent spaces. Using three distinct datasets--a handwritten digits dataset from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST, E. Alpaydin, 1998), the Chicago Face Database (Ma et al., 2015), and brain disconnection data post-stroke (Talozzi et al., 2023)--we demonstrate EMUSES' effectiveness in detecting and interpreting emergent properties. Our method not only predicts outcomes with high accuracy but also provides clear visualizations and statistical insights into the underlying interactions within the data. By bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and interpretability, EMUSES offers researchers a powerful tool to understand the multifactorial origins of complex phenomena.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |

This tool effectively simplifies the intricate and high-dimensional nature of ST data by offering a comprehensive workflow that includes data loading, region selection, gene expression analysis, and functional annotation. QuST-LLM employs LLMs to transform complex ST data into understandable and detailed biological narratives based on gene ontology annotations, thereby significantly improving the interpretability of ST data. Consequently, users can interact with their own ST data using natural language. Hence, QuST-LLM provides researchers with a potent functionality to unravel the spatial and functional complexities of tissues, fostering novel insights and advancements in biomedical research.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

The accuracy of land cover classification has gotten increasingly based on the improvement of remote sensing data. Land cover classification using satellite imageries has been explored and become more prevalent in recent years, but the methodologies remain some drawbacks of subjective and time-consuming. Some deep learning techniques have been utilized to overcome these limitations. However, most studies implemented just one image type to evaluate algorithms for land cover mapping. Therefore, our study conducted deep learning semantic segmentation in multispectral, hyperspectral, and high spatial aerial image datasets for landcover mapping. This research implemented a semantic segmentation method such as Unet, Linknet, FPN, and PSPnet for categorizing vegetation, water, and others (i.e., soil and impervious surface). The LinkNet model obtained high accuracy in IoU (Intersection Over Union) at 0.92 in all datasets, which is comparable with other mentioned techniques. In evaluation with different image types, the multispectral images showed higher performance with the IoU, and F1-score are 0.993 and 0.997, respectively. Our outcome highlighted the efficiency and broad applicability of LinkNet and multispectral image on land cover classification. This research contributes to establishing an approach on landcover segmentation via open source for long-term future application.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSUMamba: Spatial-Spectral Selective State Space Model for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01726v6)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising is a crucial preprocessing step for hyperspectral images (HSIs) due to noise arising from intraimaging mechanisms and environmental factors. Long-range spatial-spectral correlation modeling is beneficial for HSI denoising but often comes with high computational complexity. Based on the state space model (SSM), Mamba is known for its remarkable long-range dependency modeling capabilities and computational efficiency. Building on this, we introduce a memory-efficient spatial-spectral UMamba (SSUMamba) for HSI denoising, with the spatial-spectral continuous scan (SSCS) Mamba being the core component. SSCS Mamba alternates the row, column, and band in six different orders to generate the sequence and uses the bidirectional SSM to exploit long-range spatial-spectral dependencies. In each order, the images are rearranged between adjacent scans to ensure spatial-spectral continuity. Additionally, 3D convolutions are embedded into the SSCS Mamba to enhance local spatial-spectral modeling. Experiments demonstrate that SSUMamba achieves superior denoising results with lower memory consumption per batch compared to transformer-based methods. The source code is available at https://github.com/lronkitty/SSUMamba.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the lacking of physical world's corpus and knowledge during training, they usually fail to solve many real-life tasks in the urban space. In this paper, we propose CityGPT, a systematic framework for enhancing the capability of LLMs on understanding urban space and solving the related urban tasks by building a city-scale world model in the model. First, we construct a diverse instruction tuning dataset CityInstruction for injecting urban knowledge and enhancing spatial reasoning capability effectively. By using a mixture of CityInstruction and general instruction data, we fine-tune various LLMs (e.g., ChatGLM3-6B, Qwen1.5 and LLama3 series) to enhance their capability without sacrificing general abilities. To further validate the effectiveness of proposed methods, we construct a comprehensive benchmark CityEval to evaluate the capability of LLMs on diverse urban scenarios and problems. Extensive evaluation results demonstrate that small LLMs trained with CityInstruction can achieve competitive performance with commercial LLMs in the comprehensive evaluation of CityEval. The source codes are openly accessible to the research community via https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/CityGPT.</p></details> |  |

We encounter such geospatial videos on a daily basis and such videos have been growing in volume significantly. Yet, we do not have data management systems that allow users to interact with such data effectively. In this paper, we describe Spatialyze, a new framework for end-to-end querying of geospatial videos. Spatialyze comes with a domain-specific language where users can construct geospatial video analytic workflows using a 3-step, declarative, build-filter-observe paradigm. Internally, Spatialyze leverages the declarative nature of such workflows, the temporal-spatial metadata stored with videos, and physical behavior of real-world objects to optimize the execution of workflows.

However, models can easily fail to provide solutions in unobserved complex input compositions due to not achieving the level of abstraction required for generalizability. To alleviate this issue, we propose training the language models with neuro-symbolic techniques that can exploit the logical rules of reasoning as constraints and provide additional supervision sources to the model. Training models to adhere to the regulations of reasoning pushes them to make more effective abstractions needed for generalizability and transfer learning. We focus on a challenging problem of spatial reasoning over text. Our results on various benchmarks using multiple language models confirm our hypothesis of effective domain transfer based on neuro-symbolic training.</p></details> |  |

Despite its success, it remains an open question regarding DAM's performance on 360 images that enjoy a large field-of-view (180x360) but suffer from spherical distortions. To this end, we establish, to our knowledge, the first benchmark that aims to 1) evaluate the performance of DAM on 360 images and 2) develop a powerful 360 DAM for the benefit of the community. For this, we conduct a large suite of experiments that consider the key properties of 360 images, e.g., different 360 representations, various spatial transformations, and diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. This way, our benchmark unveils some key findings, e.g., DAM is less effective for diverse 360 scenes and sensitive to spatial transformations. To address these challenges, we first collect a large-scale unlabeled dataset including diverse indoor and outdoor scenes. We then propose a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework to learn a 360 DAM, dubbed Any360D. Under the umbrella of SSL, Any360D first learns a teacher model by fine-tuning DAM via metric depth supervision. Then, we train the student model by uncovering the potential of large-scale unlabeled data with pseudo labels from the teacher model. M\"obius transformation-based spatial augmentation (MTSA) is proposed to impose consistency regularization between the unlabeled data and spatially transformed ones. This subtly improves the student model's robustness to various spatial transformations even under severe distortions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Any360D outperforms DAM and many prior data-specific models, e.g., PanoFormer, across diverse scenes, showing impressive zero-shot capacity for being a 360 depth foundation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-scale Restoration of Missing Data in Optical Time-series Images with Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13358v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to factors such as thick cloud cover and sensor limitations, remote sensing images often suffer from significant missing data, resulting in incomplete time-series information. Existing methods for imputing missing values in remote sensing images do not fully exploit spatio-temporal auxiliary information, leading to limited accuracy in restoration. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach called MS2TAN (Multi-scale Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network), for reconstructing time-series remote sensing images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient spatio-temporal feature extractor based on Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention (MSTA), to obtain high-quality representations of the spatio-temporal neighborhood features in the missing regions. Secondly, a Multi-scale Restoration Network consisting of the MSTA-based Feature Extractors, is employed to progressively refine the missing values by exploring spatio-temporal neighborhood features at different scales. Thirdly, we propose a ``Pixel-Structure-Perception'' Multi-Objective Joint Optimization method to enhance the visual effects of the reconstruction results from multiple perspectives and preserve more texture structures. Furthermore, the proposed method reconstructs missing values in all input temporal phases in parallel (i.e., Multi-In Multi-Out), achieving higher processing efficiency. Finally, experimental evaluations on two typical missing data restoration tasks across multiple research areas demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an improvement of 0.40dB/1.17dB in mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (mPSNR) and 3.77/9.41 thousandths in mean structural similarity (mSSIM), while exhibiting stronger texture and structural consistency.</p></details> |  |

This skill rests on the ability to recognize and localize objects of interest and determine their spatial relation. Early vision and language models (VLMs) have been shown to struggle to recognize spatial relations. We extend the previously released What'sUp dataset and propose a novel comprehensive evaluation for spatial relationship understanding that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of 27 different models. In addition to the VLMs evaluated in What'sUp, our extensive evaluation encompasses 3 classes of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) that vary in their parameter sizes (ranging from 7B to 110B), training/instruction-tuning methods, and visual resolution to benchmark their performances and scrutinize the scaling laws in this task.</p></details> |  |

However, their ability to reason about spatial arrangements remains limited. In this work, we introduce Spatial Region GPT (SpatialRGPT) to enhance VLMs' spatial perception and reasoning capabilities. SpatialRGPT advances VLMs' spatial understanding through two key innovations: (1) a data curation pipeline that enables effective learning of regional representation from 3D scene graphs, and (2) a flexible plugin module for integrating depth information into the visual encoder of existing VLMs. During inference, when provided with user-specified region proposals, SpatialRGPT can accurately perceive their relative directions and distances. Additionally, we propose SpatialRGBT-Bench, a benchmark with ground-truth 3D annotations encompassing indoor, outdoor, and simulated environments, for evaluating 3D spatial cognition in VLMs. Our results demonstrate that SpatialRGPT significantly enhances performance in spatial reasoning tasks, both with and without local region prompts. The model also exhibits strong generalization capabilities, effectively reasoning about complex spatial relations and functioning as a region-aware dense reward annotator for robotic tasks.

This study proposes a multi-scale graph wavelet temporal convolution network (MSGWTCN) to predict the traffic states in complex transportation networks. Specifically, a multi-scale spatial block is designed to simultaneously capture the spatial information at different levels, and the gated temporal convolution network is employed to extract the temporal dependencies of the data. The model jointly learns to mount multiple levels of the spatial interactions by stacking graph wavelets with different scales. Two real-world datasets are used in this study to investigate the model performance, including a highway network in Seattle and a dense road network of Manhattan in New York City. Experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models. Furthermore, different scales of graph wavelets are found to be effective in extracting local, intermediate and global information at the same time and thus enable the model to learn a complex transportation network topology with various types of road segments. By carefully customizing the scales of wavelets, the model is able to improve the prediction performance and better adapt to different network configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Outbreaks Using a Latent Field: Part I -- Spatial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12810v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a method to estimate the infection-rate of a disease, over a region, as a field that varies in space and time. To do so, we use time-series of case-counts of symptomatic patients as observed in the areal units that comprise the region. We also extend an epidemiological model, initially developed to represent the temporal dynamics in a single areal unit, to encompass multiple areal units. This is done using a (parameterized) Gaussian random field, whose structure is modeled using the dynamics in the case-counts, and which serves as a spatial prior, in the estimation process. The estimation is performed using an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo method, using COVID-19 case-count data collected from three adjacent counties in New Mexico, USA. We find that we can estimate both the temporal and spatial variation of the infection with sufficient accuracy to be useful in forecasting. Further, the ability to "borrow" information from neighboring areal units allows us to regularize the estimation in areal units with high variance ("poor quality") data. The ability to forecast allows us to check whether the estimated infection-rate can be used to detect a change in the epidemiological dynamics e.g., the arrival of a new wave of infection, such as the fall wave of 2020 which arrived in New Mexico in mid-September 2020. We fashion a simple anomaly detector, conditioned on the estimated infection-rate and find that it performs better than a conventional surveillance algorithm that uses case-counts (and not the infection-rate) to detect the arrival of the same wave.</p></details> | 26 pages |

It is characterized by subtle morphological changes in the brain, particularly in the gray matter. These changes are often imperceptible through manual observation, demanding an automated approach to diagnosis. This study introduces a deep learning methodology for the classification of individuals with Schizophrenia. We achieve this by implementing a diversified attention mechanism known as Spatial Sequence Attention (SSA) which is designed to extract and emphasize significant feature representations from structural MRI (sMRI). Initially, we employ the transfer learning paradigm by leveraging pre-trained DenseNet to extract initial feature maps from the final convolutional block which contains morphological alterations associated with Schizophrenia. These features are further processed by the proposed SSA to capture and emphasize intricate spatial interactions and relationships across volumes within the brain. Our experimental studies conducted on a clinical dataset have revealed that the proposed attention mechanism outperforms the existing Squeeze & Excitation Network for Schizophrenia classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for the 21st IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI 2024)</p></details> |

Accurate real-time traffic prediction is essential to improve the safety, stability, and versatility of smart city systems, i.e., traffic control and optimal routing. The complex and highly dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies make effective predictions still face many challenges. Recent studies have shown that spatial-temporal graph neural networks exhibit great potential applied to traffic prediction, which combines sequential models with graph convolutional networks to jointly model temporal and spatial correlations. However, a survey study of graph learning, spatial-temporal graph models for traffic, as well as a fair comparison of baseline models are pending and unavoidable issues. In this paper, we first provide a systematic review of graph learning strategies and commonly used graph convolution algorithms. Then we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of recently proposed spatial-temporal graph network models. Furthermore, we build a study called STG4Traffic using the deep learning framework PyTorch to establish a standardized and scalable benchmark on two types of traffic datasets. We can evaluate their performance by personalizing the model settings with uniform metrics. Finally, we point out some problems in the current study and discuss future directions.

| **[Benchmarking Label Noise in Instance Segmentation: Spatial Noise Matters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10891v2)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining accurate labels for instance segmentation is particularly challenging due to the complex nature of the task. Each image necessitates multiple annotations, encompassing not only the object's class but also its precise spatial boundaries. These requirements elevate the likelihood of errors and inconsistencies in both manual and automated annotation processes. By simulating different noise conditions, we provide a realistic scenario for assessing the robustness and generalization capabilities of instance segmentation models in different segmentation tasks, introducing COCO-N and Cityscapes-N. We also propose a benchmark for weakly annotation noise, dubbed COCO-WAN, which utilizes foundation models and weak annotations to simulate semi-automated annotation tools and their noisy labels. This study sheds light on the quality of segmentation masks produced by various models and challenges the efficacy of popular methods designed to address learning with label noise.</p></details> |  |

The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model for Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10134v3)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction, an essential component for intelligent transportation systems, endeavours to use historical data to foresee future traffic features at specific locations. Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not improved. Recently, large language models have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pretraining while maintaining their fundamental structures. Motivated by these developments, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. In the ST-LLM, we define timesteps at each location as tokens and design a spatial-temporal embedding to learn the spatial location and global temporal patterns of these tokens. Additionally, we integrate these embeddings by a fusion convolution to each token for a unified spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, we innovate a partially frozen attention strategy to adapt the LLM to capture global spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM is a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios.

However, the cost for collecting ST data is much higher than acquiring histopathological images, and thus several studies attempt to predict the gene expression on ST by leveraging their corresponding histopathological images. Most of the existing image-based gene prediction models treat the prediction task on each spot of ST data independently, which ignores the spatial dependency among spots. In addition, while the histology images share phenotypic characteristics with the ST data, it is still challenge to extract such common information to help align paired image and expression representations. To address the above issues, we propose a Multi-view Graph Contrastive Learning framework with HSIC-bottleneck Regularization(ST-GCHB) aiming at learning shared representation to help impute the gene expression of the queried imagingspots by considering their spatial dependency.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we propose a novel generalized linear model to analyze such that using a von Mises Fisher (vMF) distributed error structure. Using a novel link function that relies on the transformation between Cartesian and spherical coordinates, we regress the vMF-distributed directional data on the external covariates. This regression model enables us to quantify the impact of external factors on the observed directional data. Furthermore, we impose the spatial dependence using an autoregressive model, appropriately accounting for the directional dependence in the outcome. This novel specification renders computational efficiency and flexibility. In addition, a comprehensive Bayesian inferential toolbox is thoroughly developed and applied to our analysis. Subsequently, employing our regression model to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data, we gain new insights into the relationship between cognitive impairment and the orientations of brain fibers along with examining empirical efficacy through simulation experiments.</p></details> |  |

Building upon its predecessor, VideoLLaMA 2 incorporates a tailor-made Spatial-Temporal Convolution (STC) connector, which effectively captures the intricate spatial and temporal dynamics of video data. Additionally, we integrate an Audio Branch into the model through joint training, thereby enriching the multimodal understanding capabilities of the model by seamlessly incorporating audio cues. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple-choice video question answering (MC-VQA), open-ended video question answering (OE-VQA), and video captioning (VC) tasks demonstrate that VideoLLaMA 2 consistently achieves competitive results among open-source models and even gets close to some proprietary models on several benchmarks. Furthermore, VideoLLaMA 2 exhibits reasonable improvements in audio-only and audio-video question-answering (AQA & OE-AVQA) benchmarks over existing models. These advancements underline VideoLLaMA 2's superior performance in multimodal comprehension, setting a new standard for intelligent video analysis systems.

| **[A causal inference framework for spatial confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2112.14946v9)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, addressing spatial confounding has become a major topic in spatial statistics. However, the literature has provided conflicting definitions, and many proposed definitions do not address the issue of confounding as it is understood in causal inference. We define spatial confounding as the existence of an unmeasured causal confounder with a spatial structure. We present a causal inference framework for nonparametric identification of the causal effect of a continuous exposure on an outcome in the presence of spatial confounding. We propose double machine learning (DML), a procedure in which flexible models are used to regress both the exposure and outcome variables on confounders to arrive at a causal estimator with favorable robustness properties and convergence rates, and we prove that this approach is consistent and asymptotically normal under spatial dependence. As far as we are aware, this is the first approach to spatial confounding that does not rely on restrictive parametric assumptions (such as linearity, effect homogeneity, or Gaussianity) for both identification and estimation. We demonstrate the advantages of the DML approach analytically and in simulations. We apply our methods and reasoning to a study of the effect of fine particulate matter exposure during pregnancy on birthweight in California.</p></details> | <details><summary>remov...</summary><p>remove extraneous text</p></details> |

Accurate estimation of ride-sharing improves service utilization and reliability and reduces travel time and traffic congestion. In this study, we employ two Bayesian models to estimate ride-sharing demand in the 77 Chicago community areas. We consider demographic, scoio-economic, transportation factors as well as land-use characteristics as explanatory variables. Our models assume conditional autoregression (CAR) prior for the explanatory variables. Moreover, the Bayesian frameworks estimate both the unstructured random error and the struc-tured errors for the spatial and the spatiotemporal correlation. We assessed the performance of the estimated models and the residuals of the spatial regression model have no left-over spatial structure. For the spatiotemporal model, the squared correlation between actual ride-shares and the fitted values is 0.95. Our analysis revealed that the demographic factors (populations size and registered crimes) positively impact the ride-sharing demand. Additionally, the ride-sharing demand increases with higher income and increase in the economically active propor-tion of the population as well as the residents with no cars. Moreover, the transit availability and the walkability indices are crucial determinants for the ridesharing in Chicago.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accurate and Fast Pixel Retrieval with Spatial and Uncertainty Aware Hypergraph Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11242v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel method designed to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of both image retrieval and pixel retrieval. Traditional diffusion methods struggle to propagate spatial information effectively in conventional graphs due to their reliance on scalar edge weights. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hypergraph-based framework, uniquely capable of efficiently propagating spatial information using local features during query time, thereby accurately retrieving and localizing objects within a database. Additionally, we innovatively utilize the structural information of the image graph through a technique we term "community selection". This approach allows for the assessment of the initial search result's uncertainty and facilitates an optimal balance between accuracy and speed. This is particularly crucial in real-world applications where such trade-offs are often necessary. Our experimental results, conducted on the (P)ROxford and (P)RParis datasets, demonstrate the significant superiority of our method over existing diffusion techniques. We achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy in both image-level and pixel-level retrieval, while also maintaining impressive processing speed. This dual achievement underscores the effectiveness of our hypergraph-based framework and community selection technique, marking a notable advancement in the field of content-based image retrieval.</p></details> |  |

In high-dimensional problems, this condition is never met. As a result, in high dimensions the Ensemble Kalman Filter's (EnKF) ensemble does not contain enough information to specify the prior covariance matrix accurately. This necessitates the need for regularization of the analysis (observation update) problem. We propose a regularization technique based on a new spatial model. The model is a constrained version of the general Gaussian process convolution model. The constraints include local stationarity and smoothness of local spectra. We regularize EnKF by postulating that its prior covariances obey the spatial model. Placing a hyperprior distribution on the model parameters and using the likelihood of the prior ensemble data allows for an optimized use of both the ensemble and the hyperprior. The respective estimator is shown to be consistent. Its neural Bayes implementation proved to be both accurate and computationally efficient. In simulation experiments, the new technique led to substantially better EnKF performance than several existing techniques.</p></details> | 46 pages, 9 figures |

Despite various pre-training methods tailored to the characteristics of RS data, a key limitation persists: the inability to effectively integrate spatial, temporal, and spectral information within a single unified model. To unlock the potential of RS data, we construct a Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Structured Dataset (STSSD) characterized by the incorporation of multiple RS sources, diverse coverage, unified locations within image sets, and heterogeneity within images. Building upon this structured dataset, we propose an Anchor-Aware Masked AutoEncoder method (A$^{2}$-MAE), leveraging intrinsic complementary information from the different kinds of images and geo-information to reconstruct the masked patches during the pre-training phase. A$^{2}$-MAE integrates an anchor-aware masking strategy and a geographic encoding module to comprehensively exploit the properties of RS images. Specifically, the proposed anchor-aware masking strategy dynamically adapts the masking process based on the meta-information of a pre-selected anchor image, thereby facilitating the training on images captured by diverse types of RS sources within one model. Furthermore, we propose a geographic encoding method to leverage accurate spatial patterns, enhancing the model generalization capabilities for downstream applications that are generally location-related. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves comprehensive improvements across various downstream tasks compared with existing RS pre-training methods, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and change detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

The FINCH mission, a 3U+ CubeSat equipped with a hyperspectral camera, aims to monitor crop residue cover in agricultural fields. Although hyperspectral imaging captures both spectral and spatial information, it is prone to various types of noise, including random noise, stripe noise, and dead pixels. Effective denoising of these images is crucial for downstream scientific tasks. Traditional methods, including hand-crafted techniques encoding strong priors, learned 2D image denoising methods applied across different hyperspectral bands, or diffusion generative models applied independently on bands, often struggle with varying noise strengths across spectral bands, leading to significant spectral distortion. This paper presents a novel approach to hyperspectral image denoising using latent diffusion models that integrate spatial and spectral information. We particularly do so by building a 3D diffusion model and presenting a 3-stage training approach on real and synthetically crafted datasets. The proposed method preserves image structure while reducing noise. Evaluations on both popular hyperspectral denoising datasets and synthetically crafted datasets for the FINCH mission demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in 38th Annual Small Satellite Conference</p></details> |

In spite of the recent adoption of vision language models (VLMs) to control robot behavior, VLMs struggle to precisely articulate robot actions using language. We introduce an automatic synthetic data generation pipeline that instruction-tunes VLMs to robotic domains and needs. Using the pipeline, we train RoboPoint, a VLM that predicts image keypoint affordances given language instructions. Compared to alternative approaches, our method requires no real-world data collection or human demonstration, making it much more scalable to diverse environments and viewpoints. In addition, RoboPoint is a general model that enables several downstream applications such as robot navigation, manipulation, and augmented reality (AR) assistance. Our experiments demonstrate that RoboPoint outperforms state-of-the-art VLMs (GPT-4o) and visual prompting techniques (PIVOT) by 21.8% in the accuracy of predicting spatial affordance and by 30.5% in the success rate of downstream tasks.

By reconstructing missing pixel/voxel information in visible patches, a ViT encoder can aggregate contextual information for downstream tasks. But, existing MAE pre-training methods, which were specifically developed with the ViT architecture, lack the ability to capture geometric shape and spatial information, which is critical for medical image segmentation tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel extension of known MAEs for self pre-training (i.e., models pre-trained on the same target dataset) for 3D medical image segmentation. (1) We propose a new topological loss to preserve geometric shape information by computing topological signatures of both the input and reconstructed volumes, learning geometric shape information. (2) We introduce a pre-text task that predicts the positions of the centers and eight corners of 3D crops, enabling the MAE to aggregate spatial information. (3) We extend the MAE pre-training strategy to a hybrid state-of-the-art (SOTA) medical image segmentation architecture and co-pretrain it alongside the ViT. (4) We develop a fine-tuned model for downstream segmentation tasks by complementing the pre-trained ViT encoder with our pre-trained SOTA model. Extensive experiments on five public 3D segmentation datasets show the effectiveness of our new approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Spatial-Temporal Consistency for Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10501v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been efforts to improve the performance in sign language recognition by designing self-supervised learning methods. However, these methods capture limited information from sign pose data in a frame-wise learning manner, leading to sub-optimal solutions. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective self-supervised contrastive learning framework to excavate rich context via spatial-temporal consistency from two distinct perspectives and learn instance discriminative representation for sign language recognition. On one hand, since the semantics of sign language are expressed by the cooperation of fine-grained hands and coarse-grained trunks, we utilize both granularity information and encode them into latent spaces. The consistency between hand and trunk features is constrained to encourage learning consistent representation of instance samples. On the other hand, inspired by the complementary property of motion and joint modalities, we first introduce first-order motion information into sign language modeling. Additionally, we further bridge the interaction between the embedding spaces of both modalities, facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer to enhance sign language representation. Our method is evaluated with extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance with a notable margin.

Using a Bayesian spatial model, we quantified patient-specific and neighborhood risks of stillbirth and preterm birth in the city of Philadelphia. We linked birth data from electronic health records at Penn Medicine hospitals from 2010 to 2017 with census-tract-level data from the United States Census Bureau. We found that both patient-level characteristics (e.g. self-identified race/ethnicity) and neighborhood-level characteristics (e.g. violent crime) were significantly associated with patients' risk of stillbirth or preterm birth. Our neighborhood analysis found that higher-risk census tracts had 2.68 times the average risk of stillbirth and 2.01 times the average risk of preterm birth compared to lower-risk census tracts. Higher neighborhood rates of women in poverty or on public assistance were significantly associated with greater neighborhood risk for these outcomes, whereas higher neighborhood rates of college-educated women or women in the labor force were significantly associated with lower risk. Several of these neighborhood associations were missed by the patient-level analysis. These results suggest that neighborhood-level analyses of adverse pregnancy outcomes can reveal nuanced relationships and, thus, should be considered by epidemiologists. Our findings can potentially guide place-based public health interventions to reduce stillbirth and preterm birth rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

By adopting a pre-determined star topology as a GWT prior to training, we balance edge reduction with efficient information propagation, reducing computational demands while maintaining high model performance. Both the time and memory computational complexity of generating adaptive spatial-temporal graphs is significantly reduced from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Our approach streamlines the ASTGNN deployment by eliminating the need for exhaustive training, pruning, and retraining cycles, and demonstrates empirically across various datasets that it is possible to achieve comparable performance to full models with substantially lower computational costs. Specifically, our approach enables training ASTGNNs on the largest scale spatial-temporal dataset using a single A6000 equipped with 48 GB of memory, overcoming the out-of-memory issue encountered during original training and even achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we delve into the effectiveness of the GWT from the perspective of spectral graph theory, providing substantial theoretical support. This advancement not only proves the existence of efficient sub-networks within ASTGNNs but also broadens the applicability of the LTH in resource-constrained settings, marking a significant step forward in the field of graph neural networks.

Although they are appealing to use with spatial models, where estimation is often a computational bottleneck, neural Bayes estimators in spatial applications have, to date, been restricted to data collected over a regular grid. These estimators are also currently dependent on a prescribed set of spatial locations, which means that the neural network needs to be re-trained for new data sets; this renders them impractical in many applications and impedes their widespread adoption. In this work, we employ graph neural networks to tackle the important problem of parameter point estimation from data collected over arbitrary spatial locations. In addition to extending neural Bayes estimation to irregular spatial data, our architecture leads to substantial computational benefits, since the estimator can be used with any configuration or number of locations and independent replicates, thus amortising the cost of training for a given spatial model. We also facilitate fast uncertainty quantification by training an accompanying neural Bayes estimator that approximates a set of marginal posterior quantiles. We illustrate our methodology on Gaussian and max-stable processes. Finally, we showcase our methodology on a data set of global sea-surface temperature, where we estimate the parameters of a Gaussian process model in 2161 spatial regions, each containing thousands of irregularly-spaced data points, in just a few minutes with a single graphics processing unit.</p></details> |  |

Unfortunately, the existing Transformer-based methods mainly focus on non-local modeling, neglecting the importance of locality in image denoising. Moreover, deep learning methods employ complex spectral learning mechanisms, thus introducing large computation costs. To address these problems, we propose a hybrid spatial-spectral denoising network (HSSD), in which we design a novel hybrid dual-path network inspired by CNN and Transformer characteristics, leading to capturing both local and non-local spatial details while suppressing noise efficiently. Furthermore, to reduce computational complexity, we adopt a simple but effective decoupling strategy that disentangles the learning of space and spectral channels, where multilayer perception with few parameters is utilized to learn the global correlations among spectra. The synthetic and real experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on spatial and spectral reconstruction.

However, efficiently serving multiple LLMs poses significant challenges for existing approaches due to varying popularity of LLMs. In the paper, we present MuxServe, a flexible spatial-temporal multiplexing system for efficient multiple LLM serving. The key insight behind is to colocate LLMs considering their popularity to multiplex memory resources, and leverage the characteristics of prefill and decoding phases to separate and flexibly colocate them to multiplex computation resources. MuxServe formally formulates the multiplexing problem, and proposes a novel placement algorithm and adaptive batch scheduling strategy to identify optimal colocations and maximize utilization. MuxServe designs a unified resource manager to enable flexible and efficient multiplexing. Evaluation results show that MuxServe can achieves up to $1.8\times$ higher throughput or processes $2.9\times$ more requests within $99\%$ SLO attainment.

| **[Variational Bayes Inference for Spatial Error Models with Missing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08685v1)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatial error model (SEM) is a type of simultaneous autoregressive (SAR) model for analysing spatially correlated data. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is one of the most widely used Bayesian methods for estimating SEM, but it has significant limitations when it comes to handling missing data in the response variable due to its high computational cost. Variational Bayes (VB) approximation offers an alternative solution to this problem. Two VB-based algorithms employing Gaussian variational approximation with factor covariance structure are presented, joint VB (JVB) and hybrid VB (HVB), suitable for both missing at random and not at random inference. When dealing with many missing values, the JVB is inaccurate, and the standard HVB algorithm struggles to achieve accurate inferences. Our modified versions of HVB enable accurate inference within a reasonable computational time, thus improving its performance. The performance of the VB methods is evaluated using simulated and real datasets.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we formulate the problem in terms of alignment between raw videos and spatio-temporal logic specifications. The alignment algorithm leverages a differentiable symbolic reasoner and a combination of contrastive, temporal, and semantics losses. It effectively and efficiently trains low-level perception models to extract a fine-grained video representation in the form of a spatio-temporal scene graph that conforms to the desired high-level specification. To practically reduce the manual effort of obtaining ground truth labels, we derive logic specifications from captions by employing a large language model with a generic prompting template. In doing so, we explore a novel methodology that weakly supervises the learning of spatio-temporal scene graphs with widely accessible video-caption data. We evaluate our method on three datasets with rich spatial and temporal specifications: 20BN-Something-Something, MUGEN, and OpenPVSG. We demonstrate that our method learns better fine-grained video semantics than existing baselines.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we target enhancing VLMs with a fine-grained structural spatio-temporal alignment learning method (namely Finsta). First of all, we represent the input texts and videos with fine-grained scene graph (SG) structures, both of which are further unified into a holistic SG (HSG) for bridging two modalities. Then, an SG-based framework is built, where the textual SG (TSG) is encoded with a graph Transformer, while the video dynamic SG (DSG) and the HSG are modeled with a novel recurrent graph Transformer for spatial and temporal feature propagation. A spatial-temporal Gaussian differential graph Transformer is further devised to strengthen the sense of the changes in objects across spatial and temporal dimensions. Next, based on the fine-grained structural features of TSG and DSG, we perform object-centered spatial alignment and predicate-centered temporal alignment respectively, enhancing the video-language grounding in both the spatiality and temporality. We design our method as a plug&play system, which can be integrated into existing well-trained VLMs for further representation augmentation, without training from scratch or relying on SG annotations in downstream applications. On 6 representative VL modeling tasks over 12 datasets in both standard and long-form video scenarios, Finsta consistently improves the existing 13 strong-performing VLMs persistently, and refreshes the current state-of-the-art end task performance significantly in both the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning. The code and datasets of STBench are released on https://github.com/LwbXc/STBench.</p></details> |  |

However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings: CNN are constrained by a limited receptive field that may hinder their ability to capture broader spatial contexts, while Transformers are computationally intensive, making them costly to train and deploy on large datasets. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data.

Despite remarkable breakthroughs in pretrained natural language models that enable one model to handle diverse tasks, a universal solution for spatio-temporal prediction remains challenging Existing prediction approaches are typically tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive domain-specific training data. In this study, we introduce UniST, a universal model designed for general urban spatio-temporal prediction across a wide range of scenarios. Inspired by large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) utilizing diverse spatio-temporal data from different scenarios, (ii) effective pre-training to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (iii) knowledge-guided prompts to enhance generalization capabilities. These designs together unlock the potential of building a universal model for various scenarios Extensive experiments on more than 20 spatio-temporal scenarios demonstrate UniST's efficacy in advancing state-of-the-art performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot prediction. The datasets and code implementation are released on https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniST.</p></details> |  |

While a few researchers focus on learning ice layer patterns from echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors via different convolutional neural networks, the noise in the echogram images proves to be a major obstacle. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features. We found that our proposed network can consistently outperform the current non-inductive or non-physical model in predicting deep ice layer thickness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Monotonic Modeling with Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Awareness in Diverse Marketing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14132v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the mobile internet era, the Online Food Ordering Service (OFOS) emerges as an integral component of inclusive finance owing to the convenience it brings to people. OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 7 pages |

Matrix factorization is employed to decompose spatio-temporal data into spatial and temporal components. To improve clarity in the temporal patterns, we introduce a nonnegativity constraint on the time domain along with regularization in the frequency domain. Specifically, regularization in the frequency domain involves selecting features in the frequency space, making an interpretation in the frequency domain more convenient. We propose two methods in the frequency domain: soft and hard regularizations, and provide convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points of the corresponding constrained optimization problem. While our primary motivation stems from geophysical data analysis based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data, our methodology has the potential for wider application. Consequently, when applying our methodology to GRACE data, we find that the results with the proposed methodology are comparable to previous research in the field of geophysical sciences but offer clearer interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, Final version</p></details> |

Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

| **[Enhancing Spatio-temporal Quantile Forecasting with Curriculum Learning: Lessons Learned](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12709v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training models on spatio-temporal (ST) data poses an open problem due to the complicated and diverse nature of the data itself, and it is challenging to ensure the model's performance directly trained on the original ST data. While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> |  |

Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in KDD 2024</p></details> |

This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by a recently proposed state space model named Mamba, which has shown remarkable capability of capturing long-range dependency, we propose a new STG forecasting framework named SpoT-Mamba. SpoT-Mamba generates node embeddings by scanning various node-specific walk sequences. Based on the node embeddings, it conducts temporal scans to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies.

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-temporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical system's perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

Specifically, in the context of estimation, we seek the most likely evolution realizing measured spatio-temporal marginals of killed particles. In the context of control, we seek a suitable control action directing the killed process toward spatio-temporal probabilistic constraints. To this end, we derive a new Schr\"odinger system of coupled, in space and time, partial differential equations to construct the solution of the proposed problem. Further, we show that a Fortet-Sinkhorn type of algorithm is available to attain the associated bridge. A key feature of our framework is that the obtained bridge retains the Markovian structure in the prior process, and thereby, the corresponding controller takes the form of state feedback.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Mainstream approaches employ bidirectional feature propagation, spatio-temporal transformers, or a combination of both to extract information from the video sequence. However, limitations in memory and computational resources constraints the temporal window length of the spatio-temporal transformer, preventing the extraction of longer temporal contextual information from the video sequence. Additionally, bidirectional feature propagation is highly sensitive to inaccurate optical flow in blurry frames, leading to error accumulation during the propagation process. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{BSSTNet}, \textbf{B}lur-aware \textbf{S}patio-temporal \textbf{S}parse \textbf{T}ransformer Network. It introduces the blur map, which converts the originally dense attention into a sparse form, enabling a more extensive utilization of information throughout the entire video sequence. Specifically, BSSTNet (1) uses a longer temporal window in the transformer, leveraging information from more distant frames to restore the blurry pixels in the current frame. (2) introduces bidirectional feature propagation guided by blur maps, which reduces error accumulation caused by the blur frame. The experimental results demonstrate the proposed BSSTNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the GoPro and DVD datasets.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work & Under review; 27 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables; Github Repo: https://github.com/yyysjz1997/Awesome-TimeSeries-SpatioTemporal-Diffusion-Model</p></details> |

However, significant individual variation in the organisation of the human cerebral cortex makes it difficult to identify population-level trends in these signals. Recently, Surface Vision Transformers (SiTs) have emerged as a promising approach for modelling cortical signals, yet they face some limitations in low-data scenarios due to the lack of inductive biases in their architecture. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the surface Masked AutoEncoder (sMAE) and video surface Masked AutoEncoder (vsMAE) - for multivariate and spatio-temporal pre-training of cortical signals over regular icosahedral grids. These models are trained to reconstruct cortical feature maps from masked versions of the input by learning strong latent representations of cortical structure and function. Such representations translate into better modelling of individual phenotypes and enhanced performance in downstream tasks. The proposed approach was evaluated on cortical phenotype regression using data from the young adult Human Connectome Project (HCP) and developing HCP (dHCP). Results show that (v)sMAE pre-trained models improve phenotyping prediction performance on multiple tasks by $\ge 26\%$, and offer faster convergence relative to models trained from scratch. Finally, we show that pre-training vision transformers on large datasets, such as the UK Biobank (UKB), supports transfer learning to low-data regimes. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available at https://github.com/metrics-lab/surface-masked-autoencoders .</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publications for MIDL 2024; 20 figures; 7 figures</p></details> |

Considering the spatio-temporal nature of EEG data, one of our frameworks is based on a CNN-BiLSTM model. The other involves a CNN-Transformer architecture which inherently involves the more versatile attention based learning paradigm. In both cases, a special 1D-CNN feature extraction module is used to generate the initial embeddings with 1D convolutions in the time and the EEG channel domains. Considering the EEG signals are noisy, non stationary and the discriminative features are even less clear (than in semantically structured data such as text or image), we also follow a window-based classification followed by majority voting during inference, to yield labels at a signal level. To illustrate how brain patterns correlate with different image classes, we visualize t-SNE plots of the BiLSTM embeddings alongside brain activation maps for the top 10 classes. These visualizations provide insightful revelations into the distinct neural signatures associated with each visual category, showcasing the BiLSTM's capability to capture and represent the discriminative brain activity linked to visual stimuli. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on the updated EEG-Imagenet dataset with positive comparisons with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been submitted at ICPR 2024.

However, tackling the video camouflage object detection (VCOD) task presents a unique challenge. Camouflaged objects typically blend into the background, making them difficult to distinguish in still images. Additionally, ensuring temporal consistency in this context is a challenging problem. As a result, SAM encounters limitations and falls short when applied to the VCOD task. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new method called the SAM Propagation Module (SAM-PM). Our propagation module enforces temporal consistency within SAM by employing spatio-temporal cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, we exclusively train the propagation module while keeping the SAM network weights frozen, allowing us to integrate task-specific insights with the vast knowledge accumulated by the large model. Our method effectively incorporates temporal consistency and domain-specific expertise into the segmentation network with an addition of less than 1% of SAM's parameters. Extensive experimentation reveals a substantial performance improvement in the VCOD benchmark when compared to the most recent state-of-the-art techniques.

The prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL) of batteries is crucial for ensuring reliable and efficient operation, as well as reducing maintenance costs. However, determining the life cycle of batteries in real-world scenarios is challenging, and existing methods have limitations in predicting the number of cycles iteratively. In addition, existing works often oversimplify the datasets, neglecting important features of the batteries such as temperature, internal resistance, and material type. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a two-stage RUL prediction scheme for Lithium-ion batteries using a spatio-temporal multimodal attention network (ST-MAN). The proposed ST-MAN is to capture the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in the battery data, including the features that are often neglected in existing works. Despite operating without prior knowledge of end-of-life (EOL) events, our method consistently achieves lower error rates, boasting mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE) of 0.0275 and 0.0014, respectively, compared to existing convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)-based methods. The proposed method has the potential to improve the reliability and efficiency of battery operations and is applicable in various industries.</p></details> |  |

We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian mixture model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We also investigate transductive and inductive-learning perspectives of graph U-Nets with proposed improvements. In the transductive setting, they effectively predict quantities for unseen nodes within the trained graph. In the inductive setting, they successfully perform in mesh scenarios with different vortex-shedding periods, showing 98\% improvement in predicting the future flow fields compared to a model trained without the inductive settings. It is found that graph U-Nets without pooling operations, i.e. without reducing and restoring the node dimensionality of the graph data, perform better in inductive settings due to their ability to learn from the detailed structure of each graph. Meanwhile, we also discover that the choice of normalization technique significantly impacts graph U-Net performance.</p></details> |  |

Considering the sparsity of data due to the high maintenance cost of the stations, good inference algorithms can effectively save the cost and refine the data granularity. While spatio-temporal graph neural networks have made excellent progress on this problem, their non-Euclidean and discrete data structure modeling of reality limits its potential.

Although these methods have shown some potential in creating immersive experiences, two drawbacks limit their ubiquity: (i) a significant reduction in reconstruction quality when the computing budget is limited, and (ii) a lack of semantic understanding of the underlying scenes. To address these issues, we introduce Gear-NeRF, which leverages semantic information from powerful image segmentation models. Our approach presents a principled way for learning a spatio-temporal (4D) semantic embedding, based on which we introduce the concept of gears to allow for stratified modeling of dynamic regions of the scene based on the extent of their motion. Such differentiation allows us to adjust the spatio-temporal sampling resolution for each region in proportion to its motion scale, achieving more photo-realistic dynamic novel view synthesis. At the same time, almost for free, our approach enables free-viewpoint tracking of objects of interest - a functionality not yet achieved by existing NeRF-based methods. Empirical studies validate the effectiveness of our method, where we achieve state-of-the-art rendering and tracking performance on multiple challenging datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to IEEE/CVF CVPR 2024 (Spotlight).

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated with non-separable effects such as diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonoumous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |

In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML2024 |

The existing video adversarial attack methods mainly take a gradient-based approach and generate adversarial videos with noticeable perturbations. In this paper, we propose a novel Sparse Adversarial Video Attack via Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Networks (SVASTIN) to generate adversarial videos through spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging. It consists of a Guided Target Video Learning (GTVL) module to balance the perturbation budget and optimization speed and a Spatio-Temporal Invertible Neural Network (STIN) module to perform spatio-temporal feature space information exchanging between a source video and the target feature tensor learned by GTVL module. Extensive experiments on UCF-101 and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our proposed SVASTIN can generate adversarial examples with higher imperceptibility than the state-of-the-art methods with the higher fooling rate.

We infer mechanisms with a Bayesian hierarchical dyadic model that scales well with large data sets and that accounts for spatial and temporal dependence. We construct a fully-connected network comprising spatio-temporal data for the dyadic model and use normalized composite likelihoods to account for the dependence structure in space and time. We develop a dyadic model to account for physical mechanisms commonly found in physical-statistical models and apply our methods to ancient human DNA data to infer the mechanisms that affected human movement in Bronze Age Europe.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 7 figures, 3 appendices, code on GitHub</p></details> |

Many recent studies have concentrated on meticulously reconciling various advantages, leading to designed models that are neither simple nor practical. To address this issue, this paper presents a systematic study on existing shortcomings faced by off-the-shelf models, including lack of local fidelity, poor prediction performance over long time-steps,low scalability, and inefficiency. To systematically address the aforementioned problems, we propose an EarthFarseer, a concise framework that combines parallel local convolutions and global Fourier-based transformer architectures, enabling dynamically capture the local-global spatial interactions and dependencies. EarthFarseer also incorporates a multi-scale fully convolutional and Fourier architectures to efficiently and effectively capture the temporal evolution. Our proposal demonstrates strong adaptability across various tasks and datasets, with fast convergence and better local fidelity in long time-steps predictions. Extensive experiments and visualizations over eight human society physical and natural physical datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of EarthFarseer.

Consequently, methods for predicting and preventing traffic accidents have been researched for many years. With advancements in the field of artificial intelligence, various studies have applied Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to traffic accident prediction. Modern traffic conditions change rapidly by the minute, and these changes vary significantly across different roads. In other words, the risk of traffic accidents changes minute by minute in various patterns for each road. Therefore, it is desirable to predict traffic accident risk at the Minute-Level and Road-Level. However, because roads have close and complex relationships with adjacent roads, research on predicting traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level is challenging. Thus, it is essential to build a model that can reflect the spatial and temporal characteristics of roads for traffic accident prediction. Consequently, recent attempts have been made to use Graph Convolutional Networks to capture the spatial characteristics of roads and Recurrent Neural Networks to capture their temporal characteristics for predicting traffic accident risk. This paper proposes the Sequential based Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks (SST-GCN), which combines GCN and LSTM, to predict traffic accidents at the Minute-Level and Road-Level using a road dataset constructed in Seoul, the capital of South Korea. Experiments have demonstrated that SST-GCN outperforms other state-of-the-art models in Minute-Level predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19121v2)** | 2024-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs) are widely used for learning on graph-structured data. However, key limitations of l-step MPGNNs are that their "receptive field" is typically limited to the l-hop neighborhood of a node and that information exchange between distant nodes is limited by over-squashing. Motivated by these limitations, we propose Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Networks (S$^2$GNNs) -- a new modeling paradigm for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that synergistically combines spatially and spectrally parametrized graph filters. Parameterizing filters partially in the frequency domain enables global yet efficient information propagation. We show that S$^2$GNNs vanquish over-squashing and yield strictly tighter approximation-theoretic error bounds than MPGNNs. Further, rethinking graph convolutions at a fundamental level unlocks new design spaces. For example, S$^2$GNNs allow for free positional encodings that make them strictly more expressive than the 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test. Moreover, to obtain general-purpose S$^2$GNNs, we propose spectrally parametrized filters for directed graphs. S$^2$GNNs outperform spatial MPGNNs, graph transformers, and graph rewirings, e.g., on the peptide long-range benchmark tasks, and are competitive with state-of-the-art sequence modeling. On a 40 GB GPU, S$^2$GNNs scale to millions of nodes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 27 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |

Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) sequences, recognized as the golden standard for diagnosing CVDs, can clearly visualize the dynamic flow and reveal pathological conditions within the cerebrovasculature. Therefore, precise segmentation of cerebral arteries (CAs) and classification between their main trunks and branches are crucial for physicians to accurately quantify diseases. However, achieving accurate CA segmentation in DSA sequences remains a challenging task due to small vessels with low contrast, and ambiguity between vessels and residual skull structures. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets limits exploration in the field. In this paper, we introduce a DSA Sequence-based Cerebral Artery segmentation dataset (DSCA), the first publicly accessible dataset designed specifically for pixel-level semantic segmentation of CAs. Additionally, we propose DSANet, a spatio-temporal network for CA segmentation in DSA sequences. Unlike existing DSA segmentation methods that focus only on a single frame, the proposed DSANet introduces a separate temporal encoding branch to capture dynamic vessel details across multiple frames. To enhance small vessel segmentation and improve vessel connectivity, we design a novel TemporalFormer module to capture global context and correlations among sequential frames. Furthermore, we develop a Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF) module to effectively integrate spatial and temporal features from the encoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DSANet outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in CA segmentation, achieving a Dice of 0.9033.</p></details> |  |

The primary challenge in achieving precise load forecasting for EVCS lies in accounting for the nonlinear of charging behaviors, the spatial interactions among different stations, and the intricate temporal variations in usage patterns. To address these challenges, we propose a Multiscale Spatio-Temporal Enhanced Model (MSTEM) for effective load forecasting at EVCS. MSTEM incorporates a multiscale graph neural network to discern hierarchical nonlinear temporal dependencies across various time scales. Besides, it also integrates a recurrent learning component and a residual fusion mechanism, enhancing its capability to accurately capture spatial and temporal variations in charging patterns. The effectiveness of the proposed MSTEM has been validated through comparative analysis with six baseline models using three evaluation metrics. The case studies utilize real-world datasets for both fast and slow charging loads at EVCS in Perth, UK. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MSTEM in short-term continuous load forecasting for EVCS.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, AEEES 2024</p></details> |

To this end, we combine local representation learning, which focuses on leveraging fine-grained spatial information, with a global representation encoding that captures higher-level representations and incorporates both in a joint approach. To evaluate this challenging task in a real-life setting, a new benchmark dataset is proposed providing dense spatio-temporal grounding annotations in long, untrimmed, multi-action instructional videos for over 5K events.

However, this is a nontrivial problem and poses two critical challenges: sparse spatio-temporal correlation between audio-video pairs and multimodal correlation overwriting that forgets audio-video relations. To tackle this problem, we propose a new continual audio-video pre-training method with two novel ideas: (1) Localized Patch Importance Scoring: we introduce a multimodal encoder to determine the importance score for each patch, emphasizing semantically intertwined audio-video patches. (2) Replay-guided Correlation Assessment: to reduce the corruption of previously learned audiovisual knowledge due to drift, we propose to assess the correlation of the current patches on the past steps to identify the patches exhibiting high correlations with the past steps. Based on the results from the two ideas, we perform probabilistic patch selection for effective continual audio-video pre-training. Experimental validation on multiple benchmarks shows that our method achieves a 3.69%p of relative performance gain in zero-shot retrieval tasks compared to strong continual learning baselines, while reducing memory consumption by ~45%.</p></details> | ICML 2024 |

Despite the significant strides made by graph-based networks in spatio-temporal forecasting, there remain two pivotal factors closely related to forecasting performance that need further consideration: time delays in propagation dynamics and multi-scale high-dimensional interactions. In this work, we present a Series-Aligned Multi-Scale Graph Learning (SAMSGL) framework, aiming to enhance forecasting performance. In order to handle time delays in spatial interactions, we propose a series-aligned graph convolution layer to facilitate the aggregation of non-delayed graph signals, thereby mitigating the influence of time delays for the improvement in accuracy. To understand global and local spatio-temporal interactions, we develop a spatio-temporal architecture via multi-scale graph learning, which encompasses two essential components: multi-scale graph structure learning and graph-fully connected (Graph-FC) blocks. The multi-scale graph structure learning includes a global graph structure to learn both delayed and non-delayed node embeddings, as well as a local one to learn node variations influenced by neighboring factors. The Graph-FC blocks synergistically fuse spatial and temporal information to boost prediction accuracy. To evaluate the performance of SAMSGL, we conduct experiments on meteorological and traffic forecasting datasets, which demonstrate its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> | Accepted by Chaos |

In order to summarise information encompassed in such data, we combine two well known statistical modelling methods. To account for the spatial dimension, we use the intrinsic modification of the conditional autoregression, and incorporate it with the hidden Markov model, allowing the spatial patterns to vary over time. We apply our method into parish register data considering deaths caused by measles in Finland in 1750-1850, and gain novel insight of previously undiscovered infection dynamics. Five distinctive, reoccurring states describing spatially and temporally differing infection burden and potential routes of spread are identified. We also find that there is a change in the occurrences of the most typical spatial patterns circa 1812, possibly due to changes in communication routes after major administrative transformations in Finland.</p></details> |  |

In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over the large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the dynamic evolution of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</p></details> |  |

This issue is particularly challenging in spatio-temporal analyses, where it has been less explored so far. To study the effects of air pollution on mortality in Italy, we argue that a model that simultaneously accounts for spatio-temporal confounding and for the non-linear form of the effect of interest is needed. To this end, we propose a Bayesian dynamic generalized linear model, which allows for a non-linear association and for a decomposition of the exposure effect into two components. This decomposition accommodates associations with the outcome at fine and coarse temporal and spatial scales of variation. These features, when combined, allow reducing the spatio-temporal confounding bias and recovering the true shape of the association, as demonstrated through simulation studies. The results from the real-data application indicate that the exposure effect seems to have different magnitudes in different seasons, with peaks in the summer. We hypothesize that this could be due to possible interactions between the exposure variable with air temperature and unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | 40 pages, 11 figures |

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. We evaluate STC-ViT against a operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT performs competitively with current data-driven methods in global forecasting while only being trained at lower resolution data and with less compute power.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing methodologies, often focusing on synchronous BOLD signals from functional MRI (fMRI), may not capture directional influences among brain regions and rarely tackle temporal functional dynamics. In this study, we first construct the brain-effective network via the dynamic causal model. Subsequently, we introduce an interpretable graph learning framework termed Spatio-Temporal Embedding ODE (STE-ODE). This framework incorporates specifically designed directed node embedding layers, aiming at capturing the dynamic interplay between structural and effective networks via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model, which characterizes spatial-temporal brain dynamics. Our framework is validated on several clinical phenotype prediction tasks using two independent publicly available datasets (HCP and OASIS). The experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our model compared to several state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing equivariant Graph Neural Network (GNN) based methods have encapsulated the symmetry of physics, \emph{e.g.}, translations, rotations, etc, leading to better generalization ability. Nevertheless, their frame-to-frame formulation of the task overlooks the non-Markov property mainly incurred by unobserved dynamics in the environment. In this paper, we reformulate dynamics simulation as a spatio-temporal prediction task, by employing the trajectory in the past period to recover the Non-Markovian interactions. We propose Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Attentive Graph Networks (ESTAG), an equivariant version of spatio-temporal GNNs, to fulfill our purpose. At its core, we design a novel Equivariant Discrete Fourier Transform (EDFT) to extract periodic patterns from the history frames, and then construct an Equivariant Spatial Module (ESM) to accomplish spatial message passing, and an Equivariant Temporal Module (ETM) with the forward attention and equivariant pooling mechanisms to aggregate temporal message. We evaluate our model on three real datasets corresponding to the molecular-, protein- and macro-level. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of ESTAG compared to typical spatio-temporal GNNs and equivariant GNNs.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been published to the conference of NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |

However, their performance is constrained by the reliance on extensive data for training on specific tasks, which limits their adaptability to new urban domains with varied demands. Although transfer learning has been proposed to address this problem by leveraging knowledge across domains, cross-task generalization remains underexplored in spatio-temporal graph transfer learning methods due to the absence of a unified framework. To bridge this gap, we propose Spatio-Temporal Graph Prompting (STGP), a prompt-enhanced transfer learning framework capable of adapting to diverse tasks in data-scarce domains. Specifically, we first unify different tasks into a single template and introduce a task-agnostic network architecture that aligns with this template. This approach enables the capture of spatio-temporal dependencies shared across tasks. Furthermore, we employ learnable prompts to achieve domain and task transfer in a two-stage prompting pipeline, enabling the prompts to effectively capture domain knowledge and task-specific properties at each stage. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STGP outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in three downstream tasks forecasting, kriging, and extrapolation by a notable margin.</p></details> |  |

Although deep learning approaches have achieved considerable success in predicting RUL, challenges such as low prediction accuracy and interpretability pose significant challenges, hindering their practical implementation. In this work, we introduce a Spatio-temporal Attention-based Hidden Physics-informed Neural Network (STA-HPINN) for RUL prediction, which can utilize the associated physics of the system degradation. The spatio-temporal attention mechanism can extract important features from the input data. With the self-attention mechanism on both the sensor dimension and time step dimension, the proposed model can effectively extract degradation information. The hidden physics-informed neural network is utilized to capture the physics mechanisms that govern the evolution of RUL. With the constraint of physics, the model can achieve higher accuracy and reasonable predictions. The approach is validated on a benchmark dataset, demonstrating exceptional performance when compared to cutting-edge methods, especially in the case of complex conditions.</p></details> |  |

The co-dynamics can be mediated by immunosuppression or -modulation, shared environmental or climatic drivers, or competition for susceptible hosts. Research and statistical methods in epidemiology often concentrate on large pooled datasets, or high quality data from cities, leaving rural areas underrepresented in literature. Data considering rural populations are typically sparse and scarce, especially in the case of historical data sources, which may introduce considerable methodological challenges. In order to overcome many obstacles due to such data, we present a general Bayesian spatio-temporal model for disease co-dynamics. Applying the proposed model on historical (1820-1850) Finnish parish register data, we study the spread of infectious diseases in pre-healthcare Finland. We observe that measles, pertussis, and smallpox exhibit positively correlated dynamics, which could be attributed to immunosuppressive effects or, for example, the general weakening of the population due to recurring infections or poor nutritional conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Khronos: A Unified Approach for Spatio-Temporal Metric-Semantic SLAM in Dynamic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13817v2)** | 2024-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Perceiving and understanding highly dynamic and changing environments is a crucial capability for robot autonomy. While large strides have been made towards developing dynamic SLAM approaches that estimate the robot pose accurately, a lesser emphasis has been put on the construction of dense spatio-temporal representations of the robot environment. A detailed understanding of the scene and its evolution through time is crucial for long-term robot autonomy and essential to tasks that require long-term reasoning, such as operating effectively in environments shared with humans and other agents and thus are subject to short and long-term dynamics. To address this challenge, this work defines the Spatio-temporal Metric-semantic SLAM (SMS) problem, and presents a framework to factorize and solve it efficiently. We show that the proposed factorization suggests a natural organization of a spatio-temporal perception system, where a fast process tracks short-term dynamics in an active temporal window, while a slower process reasons over long-term changes in the environment using a factor graph formulation. We provide an efficient implementation of the proposed spatio-temporal perception approach, that we call Khronos, and show that it unifies exiting interpretations of short-term and long-term dynamics and is able to construct a dense spatio-temporal map in real-time. We provide simulated and real results, showing that the spatio-temporal maps built by Khronos are an accurate reflection of a 3D scene over time and that Khronos outperforms baselines across multiple metrics. We further validate our approach on two heterogeneous robots in challenging, large-scale real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems, 2024.

| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v3)** | 2024-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'2024 as Full Paper</p></details> |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10832v1)** | 2024-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection (STAD) is an important fine-grained video understanding task. Current methods require box and label supervision for all action classes in advance. However, in real-world applications, it is very likely to come across new action classes not seen in training because the action category space is large and hard to enumerate. Also, the cost of data annotation and model training for new classes is extremely high for traditional methods, as we need to perform detailed box annotations and re-train the whole network from scratch. In this paper, we propose a new challenging setting by performing open-vocabulary STAD to better mimic the situation of action detection in an open world. Open-vocabulary spatio-temporal action detection (OV-STAD) requires training a model on a limited set of base classes with box and label supervision, which is expected to yield good generalization performance on novel action classes. For OV-STAD, we build two benchmarks based on the existing STAD datasets and propose a simple but effective method based on pretrained video-language models (VLM). To better adapt the holistic VLM for the fine-grained action detection task, we carefully fine-tune it on the localized video region-text pairs. This customized fine-tuning endows the VLM with better motion understanding, thus contributing to a more accurate alignment between video regions and texts. Local region feature and global video feature fusion before alignment is adopted to further improve the action detection performance by providing global context. Our method achieves a promising performance on novel classes.</p></details> |  |

In the 1990s, the US EPA enacted the reformulated gasoline program in select areas of the US, which drastically reduced ambient TRAP in affected areas. This created an ideal quasi-experiment to study the effects of TRAP on childhood hematologic cancers. However, existing methods for quasi-experimental analyses can perform poorly when outcomes are rare and unstable, as with childhood cancer incidence. We develop Bayesian spatio-temporal matrix completion methods to conduct causal inference in quasi-experimental settings with rare outcomes. Selective information sharing across space and time enables stable estimation, and the Bayesian approach facilitates uncertainty quantification. We evaluate the methods through simulations and apply them to estimate the causal effects of TRAP on childhood leukemia and lymphoma.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Tidy Framework and Infrastructure to Systematically Assemble Spatio-temporal Indexes from Multivariate Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05812v2)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indexes are useful for summarizing multivariate information into single metrics for monitoring, communicating, and decision-making. While most work has focused on defining new indexes for specific purposes, more attention needs to be directed towards making it possible to understand index behavior in different data conditions, and to determine how their structure affects their values and variation in values. Here we discuss a modular data pipeline recommendation to assemble indexes. It is universally applicable to index computation and allows investigation of index behavior as part of the development procedure. One can compute indexes with different parameter choices, adjust steps in the index definition by adding, removing, and swapping them to experiment with various index designs, calculate uncertainty measures, and assess indexes robustness. The paper presents three examples to illustrate the pipeline framework usage: comparison of two different indexes designed to monitor the spatio-temporal distribution of drought in Queensland, Australia; the effect of dimension reduction choices on the Global Gender Gap Index (GGGI) on countries ranking; and how to calculate bootstrap confidence intervals for the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). The methods are supported by a new R package, called tidyindex.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fighter flight trajectory prediction based on spatio-temporal graphcial attention network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08034v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quickly and accurately predicting the flight trajectory of a blue army fighter in close-range air combat helps a red army fighter gain a dominant situation, which is the winning factor in later air combat. However,due to the high speed and even hypersonic capabilities of advanced fighters, the diversity of tactical maneuvers,and the instantaneous nature of situational transitions,it is difficult to meet the requirements of practical combat applications in terms of prediction accuracy.To improve prediction accuracy,this paper proposes a spatio-temporal graph attention network (ST-GAT) using encoding and decoding structures to predict the flight trajectory. The encoder adopts a parallel structure of Transformer and GAT branches embedded with the multi-head self-attention mechanism in each front end. The Transformer branch network is used to extract the temporal characteristics of historical trajectories and capture the impact of the fighter's historical state on future trajectories, while the GAT branch network is used to extract spatial features in historical trajectories and capture potential spatial correlations between fighters.Then we concatenate the outputs of the two branches into a new feature vector and input it into a decoder composed of a fully connected network to predict the future position coordinates of the blue army fighter.The computer simulation results show that the proposed network significantly improves the prediction accuracy of flight trajectories compared to the enhanced CNN-LSTM network (ECNN-LSTM), with improvements of 47% and 34% in both ADE and FDE indicators,providing strong support for subsequent autonomous combat missions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual-based Attention Physics-informed Neural Networks for Efficient Spatio-Temporal Lifetime Assessment of Transformers Operated in Renewable Power Plants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06443v1)** | 2024-05-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers are vital assets for the reliable and efficient operation of power and energy systems. They support the integration of renewables to the grid through improved grid stability and operation efficiency. Monitoring the health of transformers is essential to ensure grid reliability and efficiency. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex and expensive and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing computationally-efficient HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces an efficient spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational efficiency of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, which are validated through PDE resolution models and fiber optic sensor measurements, respectively. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, aiding transformer health management decision-making and providing insights into localized thermal ageing phenomena in the transformer insulation. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operated on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

Neuromorphic disciplines view the brain as a coevolved system, simultaneously optimizing the hardware and the algorithms running on it. There are clear efficiency gains when bringing the computations into a physical substrate, but we presently lack theories to guide efficient implementations. Here, we present a principled computational model for neuromorphic systems in terms of spatio-temporal receptive fields, based on affine Gaussian kernels over space and leaky-integrator and leaky integrate-and-fire models over time. Our theory is provably covariant to spatial affine and temporal scaling transformations, and with close similarities to the visual processing in mammalian brains. We use these spatio-temporal receptive fields as a prior in an event-based vision task, and show that this improves the training of spiking networks, which otherwise is known as problematic for event-based vision. This work combines efforts within scale-space theory and computational neuroscience to identify theoretically well-founded ways to process spatio-temporal signals in neuromorphic systems. Our contributions are immediately relevant for signal processing and event-based vision, and can be extended to other processing tasks over space and time, such as memory and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/jegp/nrf</p></details> |

Despite significant strides in ST modeling in recent years, there remains a need to emphasize harnessing the potential of information from different modalities. Robust MoST forecasting is more challenging because it possesses (i) high-dimensional and complex internal structures and (ii) dynamic heterogeneity caused by temporal, spatial, and modality variations. In this study, we propose a novel MoST learning framework via Self-Supervised Learning, namely MoSSL, which aims to uncover latent patterns from temporal, spatial, and modality perspectives while quantifying dynamic heterogeneity. Experiment results on two real-world MoST datasets verify the superiority of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art baselines.

As one of the important application domains of foundation models, earth observation has attracted attention and various approaches have been developed. When considering earth observation as a single image capture, earth observation imagery can be processed as an image with three or more channels, and when it comes with multiple image captures of different timestamps at one location, the temporal observation can be considered as a set of continuous image resembling video frames or medical SCAN slices. This paper presents Spatio-Temporal SwinMAE (ST-SwinMAE), an architecture which particularly focuses on representation learning for spatio-temporal image processing. Specifically, it uses a hierarchical Masked Auto-encoder (MAE) with Video Swin Transformer blocks. With the architecture, we present a pretrained model named Degas 100M as a geospatial foundation model. Also, we propose an approach for transfer learning with Degas 100M, which both pretrained encoder and decoder of MAE are utilized with skip connections added between them to achieve multi-scale information communication, forms an architecture named Spatio-Temporal SwinUNet (ST-SwinUNet). Our approach shows significant improvements of performance over existing state-of-the-art of foundation models. Specifically, for transfer learning of the land cover downstream task on the PhilEO Bench dataset, it shows 10.4\% higher accuracy compared with other geospatial foundation models on average.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint covariance properties under geometric image transformations for spatio-temporal receptive fields according to the generalized Gaussian derivative model for visual receptive fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10543v5)** | 2024-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The influence of natural image transformations on receptive field responses is crucial for modelling visual operations in computer vision and biological vision. In this regard, covariance properties with respect to geometric image transformations in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy are essential for expressing robust image operations, and for formulating invariant visual operations at higher levels. This paper defines and proves a set of joint covariance properties under compositions of spatial scaling transformations, spatial affine transformations, Galilean transformations and temporal scaling transformations, which make it possible to characterize how different types of image transformations interact with each other and the associated spatio-temporal receptive field responses. In this regard, we also extend the notion of scale-normalized derivatives to affine-normalized derivatives, to be able to obtain true affine-covariant properties of spatial derivatives, that are computed based on spatial smoothing with affine Gaussian kernels. The derived relations show how the parameters of the receptive fields need to be transformed, in order to match the output from spatio-temporal receptive fields under composed spatio-temporal image transformations. As a side effect, the presented proof for the joint covariance property over the integrated combination of the different geometric image transformations also provides specific proofs for the individual transformation properties, which have not previously been fully reported in the literature. The paper also presents an in-depth theoretical analysis of geometric interpretations of the derived covariance properties, as well as outlines a number of biological interpretations of these results.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 13 figures.

In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved state-of-the-art results in the context of numerous traffic forecasting challenges. This work aims at expanding upon the conventional spatio-temporal graph neural network architectures in a manner that may facilitate the inclusion of information regarding the examined regions, as well as the populations that traverse them, in order to establish a more efficient prediction model. The end-product of this scientific endeavour is a novel spatio-temporal graph neural network architecture that is referred to as WEST (WEighted STacked) GCN-LSTM. Furthermore, the inclusion of the aforementioned information is conducted via the use of two novel dedicated algorithms that are referred to as the Shared Borders Policy and the Adjustable Hops Policy. Through information fusion and distillation, the proposed solution manages to significantly outperform its competitors in the frame of an experimental evaluation that consists of 19 forecasting models, across several datasets. Finally, an additional ablation study determined that each of the components of the proposed solution contributes towards enhancing its overall performance.</p></details> |  |

Our work primarily addresses this, introducing more realistic and flexible models for spatio-temporal random fields. We break away from the traditional confines of the classic frozen field by either relaxing the assumption of a single deterministic velocity or rethinking the hypothesis regarding the spectrum shape, thus enhancing the realism of our models. While the proposed models stand out for their realism and flexibility, they are also paired with simulation algorithms that are equally or less computationally complex than the commonly used circulant embedding for Gaussian random fields in $\mathbb{R}^{2+1}$. This combination of realistic modeling with efficient simulation methods creates an effective solution for better understanding traveling phenomena.</p></details> |  |

Additionally, the knowledge map displays spatial and temporal distributions via spatial maps and time axes, respectively. Our visualization technology addresses the limitations inherent in single-view approaches and the deficiency of interaction in spatio-temporal perspectives evident in existing visualization methods.

When using the physics informed neural network (PINN) to simulate the long time evolution, it is necessary to decompose the time domain to capture the transition of solutions in different time. Moreover, the baseline PINN can't maintain the mass conservation property for the equations. We propose a mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN. This method adaptively dividing the time domain according to the rate of energy decrease, and solves the Cahn-Hilliard equation in each time step using an independent neural network. To improve the prediction accuracy, spatial adaptive sampling is employed in the subdomain to select points with large residual value and add them to the training samples. Additionally, a mass constraint is added to the loss function to compensate the mass degradation problem of the PINN method in solving the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The mass-preserving spatio-temporal adaptive PINN is employed to solve a series of numerical examples. These include the Cahn-Hilliard equations with different bulk potentials, the three dimensional Cahn-Hilliard equation with singularities, and the set of Cahn-Hilliard equations. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian predictive inference allows for coherently incorporating uncertainty about unknown quantities by making use of methods or models that produce predictive distributions, which in turn inform decision problems. By formalizing these decision problems into properties with the help of spatio-temporal logic, we can formulate and predict how likely such properties are to be satisfied in the future at a certain location. Moreover, we can leverage our methodology to evaluate and compare models directly on their ability to predict the satisfaction of application-driven properties. The approach is illustrated in an urban mobility application, where the crowdedness in the center of Milan is proxied by aggregated mobile phone traffic data. We specify several desirable spatio-temporal properties related to city crowdedness such as a fault-tolerant network or the reachability of hospitals. After verifying these properties on draws from the posterior predictive distributions, we compare several spatio-temporal Bayesian models based on their overall and property-based predictive performance.</p></details> |  |

Albeit recent advancements, existing powerful methods are still prone to making ambiguous predictions under scarce labeled data, embodied as the limitation of distinguishing different actions with similar spatio-temporal information. In this paper, we approach this problem by empowering the model two aspects of capability, namely discriminative spatial modeling and temporal structure modeling for learning discriminative spatio-temporal representations. Specifically, we propose an Adaptive Contrastive Learning~(ACL) strategy. It assesses the confidence of all unlabeled samples by the class prototypes of the labeled data, and adaptively selects positive-negative samples from a pseudo-labeled sample bank to construct contrastive learning. Additionally, we introduce a Multi-scale Temporal Learning~(MTL) strategy. It could highlight informative semantics from long-term clips and integrate them into the short-term clip while suppressing noisy information. Afterwards, both of these two new techniques are integrated in a unified framework to encourage the model to make accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on UCF101, HMDB51 and Kinetics400 show the superiority of our method over prior state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, 56 conferences</p></details> |

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, submitted to the ACM for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Replay-based Continuous Learning Framework for Spatio-Temporal Prediction on Streaming Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14999v1)** | 2024-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread deployment of wireless and mobile devices results in a proliferation of spatio-temporal data that is used in applications, e.g., traffic prediction, human mobility mining, and air quality prediction, where spatio-temporal prediction is often essential to enable safety, predictability, or reliability. Many recent proposals that target deep learning for spatio-temporal prediction suffer from so-called catastrophic forgetting, where previously learned knowledge is entirely forgotten when new data arrives. Such proposals may experience deteriorating prediction performance when applied in settings where data streams into the system. To enable spatio-temporal prediction on streaming data, we propose a unified replay-based continuous learning framework. The framework includes a replay buffer of previously learned samples that are fused with training data using a spatio-temporal mixup mechanism in order to preserve historical knowledge effectively, thus avoiding catastrophic forgetting. To enable holistic representation preservation, the framework also integrates a general spatio-temporal autoencoder with a carefully designed spatio-temporal simple siamese (STSimSiam) network that aims to ensure prediction accuracy and avoid holistic feature loss by means of mutual information maximization. The framework further encompasses five spatio-temporal data augmentation methods to enhance the performance of STSimSiam. Extensive experiments on real data offer insight into the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |
| **[ICST-DNET: An Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network for Traffic Speed Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13853v1)** | 2024-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic speed prediction is significant for intelligent navigation and congestion alleviation. However, making accurate predictions is challenging due to three factors: 1) traffic diffusion, i.e., the spatial and temporal causality existing between the traffic conditions of multiple neighboring roads, 2) the poor interpretability of traffic data with complicated spatio-temporal correlations, and 3) the latent pattern of traffic speed fluctuations over time, such as morning and evening rush. Jointly considering these factors, in this paper, we present a novel architecture for traffic speed prediction, called Interpretable Causal Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Network (ICST-DNET). Specifically, ICST-DENT consists of three parts, namely the Spatio-Temporal Causality Learning (STCL), Causal Graph Generation (CGG), and Speed Fluctuation Pattern Recognition (SFPR) modules. First, to model the traffic diffusion within road networks, an STCL module is proposed to capture both the temporal causality on each individual road and the spatial causality in each road pair. The CGG module is then developed based on STCL to enhance the interpretability of the traffic diffusion procedure from the temporal and spatial perspectives. Specifically, a time causality matrix is generated to explain the temporal causality between each road's historical and future traffic conditions. For spatial causality, we utilize causal graphs to visualize the diffusion process in road pairs. Finally, to adapt to traffic speed fluctuations in different scenarios, we design a personalized SFPR module to select the historical timesteps with strong influences for learning the pattern of traffic speed fluctuations. Extensive experimental results prove that ICST-DNET can outperform all existing baselines, as evidenced by the higher prediction accuracy, ability to explain causality, and adaptability to different scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Typical fine-tuning based adaptation paradigm is prone to overfitting in the few-shot learning scenarios and offers little modeling flexibility for learning temporal features in video data. In this work we present the Disentangled-and-Deformable Spatio-Temporal Adapter (D$^2$ST-Adapter), which is a novel adapter tuning framework well-suited for few-shot action recognition due to lightweight design and low parameter-learning overhead. It is designed in a dual-pathway architecture to encode spatial and temporal features in a disentangled manner. In particular, we devise the anisotropic Deformable Spatio-Temporal Attention module as the core component of D$^2$ST-Adapter, which can be tailored with anisotropic sampling densities along spatial and temporal domains to learn spatial and temporal features specifically in corresponding pathways, allowing our D$^2$ST-Adapter to encode features in a global view in 3D spatio-temporal space while maintaining a lightweight design. Extensive experiments with instantiations of our method on both pre-trained ResNet and ViT demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods for few-shot action recognition. Our method is particularly well-suited to challenging scenarios where temporal dynamics are critical for action recognition.</p></details> |  |

To identify the common drivers and extent of spatio-temporal similarity of PM2.5 and ozone, this paper proposed a log Gaussian-Gumbel Bayesian hierarchical model allowing for sharing a SPDE-AR(1) spatio-temporal interaction structure. The proposed model outperforms in terms of estimation accuracy and prediction capacity for its increased parsimony and reduced uncertainty, especially for the shared ozone sub-model. Besides the consistently significant influence of temperature (positive), extreme drought (positive), fire burnt area (positive), and wind speed (negative) on both PM2.5 and ozone, surface pressure and GDP per capita (precipitation) demonstrate only positive associations with PM2.5 (ozone), while population density relates to neither. In addition, our results show the distinct spatio-temporal interactions and different seasonal patterns of PM2.5 and ozone, with peaks of PM2.5 and ozone in cold and hot seasons, respectively. Finally, with the aid of the excursion function, we see that the areas around the intersection of San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties are likely to exceed the unhealthy ozone level for sensitive groups throughout the year. Our findings provide new insights for regional and seasonal strategies in the co-control of PM2.5 and ozone. Our methodology is expected to be utilized when interest lies in multiple interrelated processes in the fields of environment and epidemiology.</p></details> |  |
| **[DST-GTN: Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network for Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11996v1)** | 2024-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate traffic forecasting is essential for effective urban planning and congestion management. Deep learning (DL) approaches have gained colossal success in traffic forecasting but still face challenges in capturing the intricacies of traffic dynamics. In this paper, we identify and address this challenges by emphasizing that spatial features are inherently dynamic and change over time. A novel in-depth feature representation, called Dynamic Spatio-Temporal (Dyn-ST) features, is introduced, which encapsulates spatial characteristics across varying times. Moreover, a Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer Network (DST-GTN) is proposed by capturing Dyn-ST features and other dynamic adjacency relations between intersections. The DST-GTN can model dynamic ST relationships between nodes accurately and refine the representation of global and local ST characteristics by adopting adaptive weights in low-pass and all-pass filters, enabling the extraction of Dyn-ST features from traffic time-series data. Through numerical experiments on public datasets, the DST-GTN achieves state-of-the-art performance for a range of traffic forecasting tasks and demonstrates enhanced stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal patterns of diurnal temperature: a random matrix approach I-case of India](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11747v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the spatio-temporal gridded daily diurnal temperature range (DTR) data across India during the 72-year period 1951--2022. We augment this data with information on the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and on the climatic regions (Stamp's and Koeppen's classification) and four seasons of India. We use various matrix theory approaches to trim out strong but routine signals, random matrix theory to remove noise, and novel empirical generalised singular-value distributions to establish retention of essential signals in the trimmed data. We make use of the spatial Bergsma statistics to measure spatial association and identify temporal change points in the spatial-association. In particular, our investigation captures a yet unknown change-point over the 72 years under study with drastic changes in spatial-association of DTR in India. It also brings out changes in spatial association with regard to ENSO. We conclude that while studying/modelling Indian DTR data, due consideration should be granted to the strong spatial association that is being persistently exhibited over decades, and provision should be kept for potential change points in the temporal behaviour, which in turn can bring moderate to dramatic changes in the spatial association pattern. Some of our analysis also reaffirms the conclusions made by other authors, regarding spatial and temporal behavior of DTR, adding our own insights. We consider the data from the yearly, seasonal and climatic zones points of view, and discover several new and interesting statistical structures which should be of interest, especially to climatologists and statisticians. Our methods are not country specific and could be used profitably for DTR data from other geographical areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivariant Spatio-Temporal Self-Supervision for LiDAR Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11737v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular representation learning methods encourage feature invariance under transformations applied at the input. However, in 3D perception tasks like object localization and segmentation, outputs are naturally equivariant to some transformations, such as rotation. Using pre-training loss functions that encourage equivariance of features under certain transformations provides a strong self-supervision signal while also retaining information of geometric relationships between transformed feature representations. This can enable improved performance in downstream tasks that are equivariant to such transformations. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal equivariant learning framework by considering both spatial and temporal augmentations jointly. Our experiments show that the best performance arises with a pre-training approach that encourages equivariance to translation, scaling, and flip, rotation and scene flow. For spatial augmentations, we find that depending on the transformation, either a contrastive objective or an equivariance-by-classification objective yields best results. To leverage real-world object deformations and motion, we consider sequential LiDAR scene pairs and develop a novel 3D scene flow-based equivariance objective that leads to improved performance overall. We show our pre-training method for 3D object detection which outperforms existing equivariant and invariant approaches in many settings.</p></details> | technical report |

Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos/code available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning based Traffic Signal Control through Spatio-temporal Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11014v1)** | 2024-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic signal control systems (TSCSs) are integral to intelligent traffic management, fostering efficient vehicle flow. Traditional approaches often simplify road networks into standard graphs, which results in a failure to consider the dynamic nature of traffic data at neighboring intersections, thereby neglecting higher-order interconnections necessary for real-time control. To address this, we propose a novel TSCS framework to realize intelligent traffic control. This framework collaborates with multiple neighboring edge computing servers to collect traffic information across the road network. To elevate the efficiency of traffic signal control, we have crafted a multi-agent soft actor-critic (MA-SAC) reinforcement learning algorithm. Within this algorithm, individual agents are deployed at each intersection with a mandate to optimize traffic flow across the entire road network collectively. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph learning into the critic network of MA-SAC to enable the spatio-temporal interactions from multiple intersections in the road network. This method fuses hypergraph and spatio-temporal graph structures to encode traffic data and capture the complex spatial and temporal correlations between multiple intersections. Our empirical evaluation, tested on varied datasets, demonstrates the superiority of our framework in minimizing average vehicle travel times and sustaining high-throughput performance. This work facilitates the development of more intelligent and reactive urban traffic management solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A spatio-temporal model to detect potential outliers in disease mapping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09882v1)** | 2024-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal disease mapping models are commonly used to estimate the relative risk of a disease over time and across areas. For each area and time point, the disease count is modelled with a Poisson distribution whose mean is the product of an offset and the disease relative risk. This relative risk is commonly decomposed in the log scale as the sum of fixed and latent effects. The Rushworth model allows for spatio-temporal autocorrelation of the random effects. We build on the Rushworth model to accommodate and identify potentially outlying areas with respect to their disease relative risk evolution, after taking into account the fixed effects. An area may display outlying behaviour at some points in time but not all. At each time point, we assume the latent effects to be spatially structured and include scaling parameters in the precision matrix, to allow for heavy-tails. Two prior specifications are considered for the scaling parameters: one where they are independent across space and one with spatial autocorrelation. We investigate the performance of the different prior specifications of the proposed model through simulation studies and analyse the weekly evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases across the 33 boroughs of Montreal and the 96 French departments during the second wave. In Montreal, 6 boroughs are found to be potentially outlying. In France, the model with spatially structured scaling parameters identified 21 departments as potential outliers. We find that these departments tend to be close to each other and within common French regions.</p></details> |  |

To bridge the gap of learning accurate representations with efficient and flexible mechanisms, we introduce Efflex, a comprehensive pipeline for transformative graph modeling and representation learning of the large-volume spatio-temporal trajectories. Efflex pioneers the incorporation of a multi-scale k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm with feature fusion for graph construction, marking a leap in dimensionality reduction techniques by preserving essential data features. Moreover, the groundbreaking graph construction mechanism and the high-performance lightweight GCN increase embedding extraction speed by up to 36 times faster. We further offer Efflex in two versions, Efflex-L for scenarios demanding high accuracy, and Efflex-B for environments requiring swift data processing. Comprehensive experimentation with the Porto and Geolife datasets validates our approach, positioning Efflex as the state-of-the-art in the domain. Such enhancements in speed and accuracy highlight the versatility of Efflex, underscoring its wide-ranging potential for deployment in time-sensitive and computationally constrained applications.</p></details> |  |

Addressing this distinctive attribute, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-temporal CNN-Transformer network (MSSTNet). Our approach takes spatial features of different scales extracted by CNN and feeds them into a Multi-scale Embedding Layer (MELayer). The MELayer extracts multi-scale spatial information and encodes these features before sending them into a Temporal Transformer (T-Former). The T-Former simultaneously extracts temporal information while continually integrating multi-scale spatial information. This process culminates in the generation of multi-scale spatio-temporal features that are utilized for the final classification. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results on two in-the-wild datasets. Furthermore, a series of ablation experiments and visualizations provide further validation of our approach's proficiency in leveraging spatio-temporal information within DFER.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2024 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07919v1)** | 2024-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is crucial in real-world dynamic systems, predicting future changes using historical data from diverse locations. Existing methods often prioritize the development of intricate neural networks to capture the complex dependencies of the data, yet their accuracy fails to show sustained improvement. Besides, these methods also overlook node heterogeneity, hindering customized prediction modules from handling diverse regional nodes effectively. In this paper, our goal is not to propose a new model but to present a novel low-rank adaptation framework as an off-the-shelf plugin for existing spatial-temporal prediction models, termed ST-LoRA, which alleviates the aforementioned problems through node-level adjustments. Specifically, we first tailor a node adaptive low-rank layer comprising multiple trainable low-rank matrices. Additionally, we devise a multi-layer residual fusion stacking module, injecting the low-rank adapters into predictor modules of various models. Across six real-world traffic datasets and six different types of spatio-temporal prediction models, our approach minimally increases the parameters and training time of the original models by less than 4%, still achieving consistent and sustained performance enhancement.</p></details> |  |

The associated challenges are exacerbated when solutions to these interconnected problems need to both maximize task performance and respect practical constraints on time and resources. In this work, we formulate a new class of spatio-temporal heterogeneous task allocation problems that consider these complexities. We contribute a novel framework, named Quality-Optimized Incremental Task Allocation Graph Search (Q-ITAGS), to solve such problems. Q-ITAGS builds upon our prior work in trait-based coordination and offers a flexible interleaved framework that i) explicitly models and optimizes the effect of collective capabilities on task performance via learnable trait-quality maps, and ii) respects both resource constraints and spatio-temporal constraints, including a user-specified time budget (i.e., maximum makespan). In addition to algorithmic contributions, we derive theoretical suboptimality bounds in terms of task performance that varies as a function of a single hyperparameter. Our detailed experiments involving a simulated emergency response task and a real-world video game dataset reveal that i) Q-ITAGS results in superior team performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also respecting complex spatio-temporal and resource constraints, ii) Q-ITAGS efficiently learns trait-quality maps to enable effective trade-off between task performance and resource constraints, and iii) Q-ITAGS' suboptimality bounds consistently hold in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2209.13092</p></details> |

The restoration and enhancement have proven to be highly beneficial. However, there are only a limited number of enhancement methods explicitly designed for videos acquired in low-light conditions. We propose a Spatio-Temporal Aligned SUNet (STA-SUNet) model using a Swin Transformer as a backbone to capture low light video features and exploit their spatio-temporal correlations. The STA-SUNet model is trained on a novel, fully registered dataset (BVI), which comprises dynamic scenes captured under varying light conditions. It is further analysed comparatively against various other models over three test datasets. The model demonstrates superior adaptivity across all datasets, obtaining the highest PSNR and SSIM values. It is particularly effective in extreme low-light conditions, yielding fairly good visualisation results.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we utilize SeasFire, a comprehensive global wildfire dataset with climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, to enable seasonal wildfire forecasting with machine learning. For the predictive analysis, we train deep learning models with different architectures that capture the spatio-temporal context leading to wildfires. Our investigation focuses on assessing the effectiveness of these models in predicting the presence of burned areas at varying forecasting time horizons globally, extending up to six months into the future, and on how different spatial or/and temporal context affects the performance of the models. Our findings demonstrate the great potential of deep learning models in seasonal fire forecasting; longer input time-series leads to more robust predictions across varying forecasting horizons, while integrating spatial information to capture wildfire spatio-temporal dynamics boosts performance. Finally, our results hint that in order to enhance performance at longer forecasting horizons, a larger receptive field spatially needs to be considered.</p></details> |  |

However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |

Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Computational Curse of Big Data for Bayesian Additive Regression Trees: A Hitting Time Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19958v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is a popular Bayesian non-parametric regression model that is commonly used in causal inference and beyond. Its strong predictive performance is supported by theoretical guarantees that its posterior distribution concentrates around the true regression function at optimal rates under various data generative settings and for appropriate prior choices. In this paper, we show that the BART sampler often converges slowly, confirming empirical observations by other researchers. Assuming discrete covariates, we show that, while the BART posterior concentrates on a set comprising all optimal tree structures (smallest bias and complexity), the Markov chain's hitting time for this set increases with $n$ (training sample size), under several common data generative settings. As $n$ increases, the approximate BART posterior thus becomes increasingly different from the exact posterior (for the same number of MCMC samples), contrasting with earlier concentration results on the exact posterior. This contrast is highlighted by our simulations showing worsening frequentist undercoverage for approximate posterior intervals and a growing ratio between the MSE of the approximate posterior and that obtainable by artificially improving convergence via averaging multiple sampler chains. Finally, based on our theoretical insights, possibilities are discussed to improve the BART sampler convergence performance.</p></details> |  |

We wished to establish the extent to which predictions of time of relapse from such a model could be improved upon using Bayesian methods. The same dataset was reanalysed with a Bayesian skew-Student mixture model. Predictions were made of which of any pair of patients would relapse first and of the time of relapse. The benefit of using these biomarkers relative to predictions made without them was measured by the apparent Shannon information, using as prior an exponential attrition model of relapse time independent of input variables. Using half the dataset for training and the other half for testing, predictions of relapse time from the strict Cox model gave $-\infty$ nepers of apparent Shannon information (it predicts that relapse can only occur at times when patients in the training set relapsed). Deliberately smoothed predictions from the Cox model gave -0.001 (-0.131 to +0.120) nepers, while the Bayesian model gave +0.109 (+0.021 to +0.192) nepers (mean, 2.5 to 97.5 centiles), being positive with posterior probability 0.993 and beating the blurred Cox model with posterior probability 0.927. These predictions from the Bayesian model thus outperform those of the Cox model, but the overall yield of predictive information leaves scope for improvement of the range of biomarkers in use. The Bayesian model presented here is the first such model for prostate cancer to consider the variation of relapse hazard with biomarker concentrations to be smooth, as is intuitive. It is also the first to be shown to provide more apparent Shannon information than the Cox model or to be shown to provide positive apparent information relative to an exponential prior.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures; v2 clarifies that Gleason grade and stage were also included in the data vector for each patient</p></details> |

To do so, we present an algorithm to efficiently maintain a coreset, a compressed version of the dataset, that allows easy computation of a clustering solution at query time. Our coreset algorithm has near-optimal update time of $\tilde O(k)$ in general metric spaces, which reduces to $\tilde O(d)$ in the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$. The query time is $O(k^2)$ in general metrics, and $O(kd)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$. To maintain a constant-factor approximation for $k$-median and $k$-means clustering in Euclidean space, this directly leads to an algorithm update time $\tilde O(d)$, and query time $\tilde O(kd + k^2)$. To maintain a $O(polylog~k)$-approximation, the query time is reduced to $\tilde O(kd)$.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ESA 2024</p></details> |
| **[The Relationship Between Time and Distance Perception in Egocentric and Discrete Virtual Locomotion (Teleportation)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19895v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traveling distances in the real world inherently involves time, as moving to a desired location is a continuous process. This temporal component plays a role when estimating the distance covered. However, in virtual environments, this relationship is often changed or absent. Common teleportation techniques enable instantaneous transitions, lacking any temporal element that might aid in distance perception. Since distances are found to be commonly underestimated in virtual environments, we investigate the influence of time on this misperception, specifically in target-selection-based teleportation interfaces. Our first experiment explores how introducing a delay proportional to the distance covered by teleportation affects participants' perception of distances, focusing on underestimation, accuracy, and precision. Participants are required to teleport along a predefined path with varying delays. A second experiment is designed to determine whether this effect manifests in a more application-specific scenario. The results indicate a significant reduction in distance underestimation, improving from 27% to 16.8% with a delayed teleportation method. Other sub-scales of distance estimation hardly differ. Despite targeted adaptations of previous study designs, participants have again found strategies supporting them in estimating distances. We conclude that time is a factor affecting distance perception and should be considered alongside other factors identified in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Existing research in this field has mostly focused on learning linear temporal properties specified using popular logics, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) and Signal Temporal Logic (STL). Branching-time logics such as Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL), despite being extensively used in specifying and verifying distributed and multi-agent systems, have not received adequate attention. Thus, in this paper, we investigate the problem of learning CTL and ATL formulas from examples of system behavior. As input to the learning problems, we rely on the typical representations of branching behavior as Kripke structures and concurrent game structures, respectively. Given a sample of structures, we learn concise formulas by encoding the learning problem into a satisfiability problem, most notably by symbolically encoding both the search for prospective formulas and their fixed-point based model checking algorithms. We also study the decision problem of checking the existence of prospective ATL formulas for a given sample. We implement our algorithms in an Python prototype and have evaluated them to extract several common CTL and ATL formulas used in practical applications.</p></details> |  |

The language verification power of finite-state verifiers is known to be sensitive to the difference between private and public randomization. These machines also lack the capability of imposing worst-case superlinear bounds on their own runtime, and long interactions with untrustable provers can involve the risk of being fooled to loop forever. We analyze such verifiers under different bounds on the numbers of private and public random bits that they are allowed to use. This separate accounting for the private and public coin budgets as resource functions of the input length provides interesting characterizations of the collections of the associated languages. When the randomness bound is constant, the verifiable class is $\rm NL$ for private-coin machines, but equals just the regular languages when one uses public coins. Increasing the public coin budget while keeping the number of private coins constant augments the power: We show that the set of languages that are verifiable by such machines in expected polynomial time (with an arbitrarily small positive probability of looping) equals the complexity class $\rm P$. This hints that allowing a minuscule probability of looping may add significant power to polynomial-time finite-state automata, since it is still not known whether those machines can verify all of $\rm P$ when required to halt with probability 1, even with no bound on their private coin usage. We also show that logarithmic-space machines which hide a constant number of their coins are limited to verifying the languages in $\rm P$.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, of which 7 pages are appendix, substantially extended version of an earlier conference version that was published in the proceedings of ICTCS 2023</p></details> |

Its primary objective is to learn the normal patterns of time series data, thereby identifying deviations in test samples. Most existing TSAD methods focus on modeling data from the temporal dimension, while ignoring the semantic information in the spatial dimension. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach, called Spatial-Temporal Normality learning (STEN). STEN is composed of a sequence Order prediction-based Temporal Normality learning (OTN) module that captures the temporal correlations within sequences, and a Distance prediction-based Spatial Normality learning (DSN) module that learns the relative spatial relations between sequences in a feature space. By synthesizing these two modules, STEN learns expressive spatial-temporal representations for the normal patterns hidden in the time series data. Extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks show that STEN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/STEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted in ECML PKDD2024</p></details> |

While the existing approaches for functional data and survival outcomes lean on the well-established Cox model, the proportional hazard (PH) assumption might not always be suitable in real-world applications. Motivated by physiological signals encountered in digital medicine, we develop a more general and flexible functional time-transformation model for estimating the conditional survival function with both functional and scalar covariates. A partially functional regression model is used to directly model the survival time on the covariates through an unknown monotone transformation and a known error distribution. We use Bernstein polynomials to model the monotone transformation function and the smooth functional coefficients. A sieve method of maximum likelihood is employed for estimation. Numerical simulations illustrate a satisfactory performance of the proposed method in estimation and inference. We demonstrate the application of the proposed model through two case studies involving wearable data i) Understanding the association between diurnal physical activity pattern and all-cause mortality based on accelerometer data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014 and ii) Modelling Time-to-Hypoglycemia events in a cohort of diabetic patients based on distributional representation of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) data. The results provide important epidemiological insights into the direct association between survival times and the physiological signals and also exhibit superior predictive performance compared to traditional summary based biomarkers in the CGM study.</p></details> |  |

For such discretizations, we give sufficient conditions for existence and uniqueness of their solutions. Two approaches are explored: the Lax-Milgram Theorem and the eigenfunction expansion. The resulting sufficient conditions, which involve certain $m\times m$ matrices (where $m$ is the order of the collocation scheme), are verified both analytically, for all $m\ge 1$ and all sets of collocation points, and computationally, for all $ m\le 20$. The semilinear case is also addressed.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |

Previous approaches either suffer from prolonged computational time caused by solving complex non-convex optimization problems or are limited by the inherent smoothness of polynomial trajectory representations, thereby restricting the flexibility of movement. In this work, we present a safe reinforcement learning approach for autonomous drone racing with time-optimal flight in cluttered environments. The reinforcement learning policy, trained using safety and terminal rewards specifically designed to enforce near time-optimal and collision-free flight, outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in achieving both minimum flight time and obstacle avoidance objectives in complex environments, with a commendable $66.7\%$ success rate in unseen, challenging settings.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures, |

However, cardiac ultrasound images are characterized by a low signal-to-noise ratio and small differences between adjacent frames, coupled with significant dimension variations between 2D frames and 3D volumes to be registered, resulting in real-time and accurate cardiac ultrasound frame-to-volume registration being a very challenging task. This paper introduces a lightweight end-to-end Cardiac Ultrasound frame-to-volume Registration network, termed CU-Reg. Specifically, the proposed model leverages epicardium prompt-guided anatomical clues to reinforce the interaction of 2D sparse and 3D dense features, followed by a voxel-wise local-global aggregation of enhanced features, thereby boosting the cross-dimensional matching effectiveness of low-quality ultrasound modalities. We further embed an inter-frame discriminative regularization term within the hybrid supervised learning to increase the distinction between adjacent slices in the same ultrasound volume to ensure registration stability. Experimental results on the reprocessed CAMUS dataset demonstrate that our CU-Reg surpasses existing methods in terms of registration accuracy and efficiency, meeting the guidance requirements of clinical cardiac interventional surgery.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by MICCAI 2024</p></details> |

Persistent homology serves as a tool to track changes of homology in the filtration. The outcome of the topological analysis of data varies depending on the choice of filtration, making the selection of filtration crucial. Filtration learning is an attempt to find an optimal filtration that minimizes the loss function. Exact Multi-parameter Persistent Homology (EMPH) has been recently proposed, particularly for topological time-series analysis, that utilizes the exact formula of rank invariant instead of calculating it. In this paper, we propose a framework for filtration learning of EMPH. We formulate an optimization problem and propose an algorithm for solving the problem. We then apply the proposed algorithm to several classification problems. Particularly, we derive the exact formula of the gradient of the loss function with respect to the filtration parameter, which makes it possible to directly update the filtration without using automatic differentiation, significantly enhancing the learning process.</p></details> | 28 pages |

This data has become instrumental in analyzing the quality of manufacturing process and equipment. Engineers and data analysts, in particular, require extensive time-series data for seasonal cycle analysis. However, due to computational resource constraints, they are often limited to querying short-term data multiple times or resorting to the use of summarized data in which key patterns may be overlooked. This study proposes a novel solution to overcome these limitations; the advanced resolution-based pixel preemption data filtering (AR-PPF) algorithm. This technology allows for efficient visualization of time-series charts over long periods while significantly reducing the time required to retrieve data. We also demonstrates how this approach not only enhances the efficiency of data analysis but also ensures that key feature is not lost, thereby providing a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of the data.</p></details> | <details><summary>7page...</summary><p>7pages, preprint, '24 Samsung Best Paper Awards</p></details> |

In these settings, prompt programs are repeatedly called with different user queries or data instances. A big practical challenge is optimizing such prompt programs. Recent work has mostly focused on either simple prompt programs or assumed that the general structure of a prompt program is fixed. We introduce SAMMO, a framework to perform symbolic prompt program search for compile-time optimizations of prompt programs. SAMMO represents prompt programs on a symbolic level which allows for a rich set of transformations that can be searched over during optimization. We show that SAMMO generalizes previous methods and improves the performance of complex prompts on (1) instruction tuning, (2) RAG pipeline tuning, and (3) prompt compression, across several different LLMs. We make all code available open-source at https://github.com/microsoft/sammo .</p></details> |  |
| **[Fearless Asynchronous Communications with Timed Multiparty Session Protocols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19541v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session types using affinity and exception handling mechanisms have been developed to ensure the communication safety of protocols implemented in concurrent and distributed programming languages. Nevertheless, current affine session types are inadequate for specifying real-world asynchronous protocols, as they are usually imposed by time constraints which enable timeout exceptions to prevent indefinite blocking while awaiting valid messages. This paper proposes the first formal integration of affinity, time constraints, timeouts, and time-failure handling based on multiparty session types for supporting reliability in asynchronous distributed systems. With this theory, we statically guarantee that asynchronous timed communication is deadlock-free, communication safe, while being fearless -- never hindered by timeout errors or abrupt terminations. To implement our theory, we introduce a Rust toolchain designed to facilitate the implementation of safe affine timed protocols. Our toolchain leverages generic types and the time library to handle timed communications, integrated with optional types for affinity. We evaluate our approach by extending diverse examples from the literature to incorporate time and timeouts, demonstrating that our solution incurs negligible overhead compared with an untimed implementation. We also showcase the correctness by construction of our approach by implementing various real-world use cases, including a remote data protocol from the Internet of Remote Things domain, as well as protocols from real-time systems like Android motion sensors and smartwatches.</p></details> | ECOOP24 |

Specifically, ReXTime focuses on reasoning across time, i.e. human-like understanding when the question and its corresponding answer occur in different video segments. This form of reasoning, requiring advanced understanding of cause-and-effect relationships across video segments, poses significant challenges to even the frontier multimodal large language models. To facilitate this evaluation, we develop an automated pipeline for generating temporal reasoning question-answer pairs, significantly reducing the need for labor-intensive manual annotations. Our benchmark includes 921 carefully vetted validation samples and 2,143 test samples, each manually curated for accuracy and relevance. Evaluation results show that while frontier large language models outperform academic models, they still lag behind human performance by a significant 14.3% accuracy gap. Additionally, our pipeline creates a training dataset of 9,695 machine generated samples without manual effort, which empirical studies suggest can enhance the across-time reasoning via fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

We present a single-step-trajectory probability analysis to time-dependent stochastic systems. Based on this analysis, we revisit several time-dependent kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) algorithms designed for systems under open-loop-control protocols. Our analysis provides an unified alternative proof to these algorithms, summarized into a pedagogical tutorial. Moreover, with the trajectory probability analysis, we present a novel feedback-controlled KMC algorithm that accurately captures the dynamics systems controlled by external signal based on measurements of the system's state. Our method correctly captures the system dynamics and avoids the artificial Zeno effect that arises from incorrectly applying the direct Gillespie algorithm to feedback-controlled systems. This work provides a unified perspective on existing open-loop-control KMC algorithms and also offers a powerful and accurate tool for simulating stochastic systems with feedback control.</p></details> |  |

This work is based on the following interesting finding: in transformer-based image classification, the class token at the first transformer encoder layer can be learned to capture the domain-specific characteristics of target samples during test-time adaptation. This learned token, when combined with input image patch embeddings, is able to gradually remove the domain-specific information from the feature representations of input samples during the transformer encoding process, thereby significantly improving the test-time adaptation performance of the source model across different domains. We refer to this class token as visual conditioning token (VCT). To successfully learn the VCT, we propose a bi-level learning approach to capture the long-term variations of domain-specific characteristics while accommodating local variations of instance-specific characteristics. Experimental results on the benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed bi-level visual conditioning token learning method is able to achieve significantly improved test-time adaptation performance by up to 1.9%.</p></details> | accepted by TMM |

However, the plethora of model formulations, the inconsistent use of terminology, and the various inferential approaches and software packages can be overwhelming to practitioners, especially when they are new to this area. With this review-like paper, we thus aim to provide guidance for both statisticians and practitioners working with latent Markov models by offering a unifying view on what otherwise are often considered separate model classes, from hidden Markov models over state-space models to Markov-modulated Poisson processes. In particular, we provide a roadmap for identifying a suitable latent Markov model formulation given the data to be analysed. Furthermore, we emphasise that it is key to applied work with any of these model classes to understand how recursive techniques exploiting the models' dependence structure can be used for inference. The R package LaMa adapts this unified view and provides an easy-to-use framework for very fast (C++ based) evaluation of the likelihood of any of the models discussed in this paper, allowing users to tailor a latent Markov model to their data using a Lego-type approach.</p></details> | 41 pages, 7 figures |

However, CDCMs face limitations in workspace and control accuracy due to non-linear cable effects causing hysteresis. This paper introduces an extensible CDCM with a Semi-active Mechanism (SAM) to expand the workspace via translational motion without additional mechanical elements or actuation. We collect a hysteresis dataset using 8 fiducial markers and RGBD sensing. Based on this dataset, we develop a real-time hysteresis compensation control algorithm using the trained Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) with a 1ms time latency, effectively estimating the manipulator's hysteresis behavior. Performance validation through random trajectory tracking tests and box pointing tasks shows the proposed controller significantly reduces hysteresis by up to 69.5% in joint space and approximately 26% in the box pointing task.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

In this study, we present Diffusion-based EXpressive TTS (DEX-TTS), an acoustic model designed for reference-based speech synthesis with enhanced style representations. Based on a general diffusion TTS framework, DEX-TTS includes encoders and adapters to handle styles extracted from reference speech. Key innovations contain the differentiation of styles into time-invariant and time-variant categories for effective style extraction, as well as the design of encoders and adapters with high generalization ability. In addition, we introduce overlapping patchify and convolution-frequency patch embedding strategies to improve DiT-based diffusion networks for TTS. DEX-TTS yields outstanding performance in terms of objective and subjective evaluation in English multi-speaker and emotional multi-speaker datasets, without relying on pre-training strategies. Lastly, the comparison results for the general TTS on a single-speaker dataset verify the effectiveness of our enhanced diffusion backbone. Demos are available here.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, despite their considerable advantages over traditional statistical approaches, current deep learning-based predictive models often exhibit a significant deviation between their forecasting outcomes and the ground truth. This discrepancy is largely due to an insufficient emphasis on extracting the sequence's latent information, particularly its global information within the frequency domain and the relationship between different variables. To address this issue, we propose a novel model Frequency-domain Attention In Two Horizons, which decomposes time series into trend and seasonal components using a multi-scale sequence adaptive decomposition and fusion architecture, and processes them separately. FAITH utilizes Frequency Channel feature Extraction Module and Frequency Temporal feature Extraction Module to capture inter-channel relationships and temporal global information in the sequence, significantly improving its ability to handle long-term dependencies and complex patterns. Furthermore, FAITH achieves theoretically linear complexity by modifying the time-frequency domain transformation method, effectively reducing computational costs. Extensive experiments on 6 benchmarks for long-term forecasting and 3 benchmarks for short-term forecasting demonstrate that FAITH outperforms existing models in many fields, such as electricity, weather and traffic, proving its effectiveness and superiority both in long-term and short-term time series forecasting tasks. Our codes and data are available at https://github.com/LRQ577/FAITH.</p></details> |  |

(2019, 2022) to dynamically partitioned systems arising from adaptive mesh refinement. The P-ERK schemes enable multirate time-integration with no changes in the spatial discretization methodology, making them readily implementable in existing codes that employ a method-of-lines approach. We show that speedup compared to a range of state of the art Runge-Kutta methods can be realized, despite additional overhead due to the dynamic re-assignment of flagging variables and restricting nonlinear stability properties. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated for a range of simulation setups for viscous and inviscid convection-dominated compressible flows for which we provide a reproducibility repository. In addition, we perform a thorough investigation of the nonlinear stability properties of the Paired-Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes regarding limitations due to the violation of monotonicity properties of the underlying spatial discretization. Furthermore, we present a novel approach for estimating the relevant eigenvalues of large Jacobians required for the optimization of stability polynomials.</p></details> |  |

Prior machine learning approaches for counterfactual predictions under time-varying treatments focus on static time-varying treatment regimes where treatments do not depend on previous covariate history. In this work, we present G-Transformer, a Transformer-based framework supporting g-computation for counterfactual prediction under dynamic and time-varying treatment strategies. G-Transfomer captures complex, long-range dependencies in time-varying covariates using a Transformer architecture. G-Transformer estimates the conditional distribution of relevant covariates given covariate and treatment history at each time point using an encoder architecture, then produces Monte Carlo estimates of counterfactual outcomes by simulating forward patient trajectories under treatment strategies of interest. We evaluate G-Transformer extensively using two simulated longitudinal datasets from mechanistic models, and a real-world sepsis ICU dataset from MIMIC-IV. G-Transformer outperforms both classical and state-of-the-art counterfactual prediction models in these settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Transformer-based architecture for counterfactual outcome prediction under dynamic and time-varying treatment strategies.</p></details> |  |

We show that popular time estimates based on FLOPs are poor estimates, and construct a more accurate proxy based on memory copies. We show that with some simple accounting, we can estimate the training speed of a transformer model from its hyperparameters. Combined with a scaling law curve like Chinchilla, this lets us estimate the final loss of the model. We fit our estimate to real data with a linear regression, and apply the result to rewrite Chinchilla in terms of a model's estimated training time as opposed to the amount of training data. This gives an expression for the loss in terms of the model's hyperparameters alone. We show that this expression is accurate across a wide range of model hyperparameter values, enabling us to analytically make architectural decisions and train models more efficiently.</p></details> |  |

This data, for instance, can help address the lower than 50% response rates to cancer immunotherapy. However, current clinical imaging modalities lack the molecular contrast, resolution, and chronic usability for rapid and accurate response assessments. Here, we present a fully wireless image sensor featuring a 2.5$\times$5 mm$^2$ CMOS integrated circuit for multicolor fluorescence imaging deep in tissue. The sensor operates wirelessly via ultrasound (US) at 5 cm depth in oil, harvesting energy with 221 mW/cm$^{2}$ incident US power density (31% of FDA limits) and backscattering data at 13 kbps with a bit error rate <$10^{-6}$. In-situ fluorescence excitation is provided by micro-laser diodes controlled with a programmable on-chip driver. An optical frontend combining a multi-bandpass interference filter and a fiber optic plate provides >6 OD excitation blocking and enables three-color imaging for detecting multiple cell types. A 36$\times$40-pixel array captures images with <125 $\mu$m resolution. We demonstrate wireless, dual-color fluorescence imaging of both effector and suppressor immune cells in ex vivo mouse tumor samples with and without immunotherapy.

However, their non-convex nature significantly slows down the optimization and control processes, limiting their application in real-time decision-making processes. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Input Convex Long Short-Term Memory (ICLSTM) network to enhance the computational efficiency of neural network-based optimization. Through two case studies employing real-time neural network-based optimization for optimizing energy and chemical systems, we demonstrate the superior performance of ICLSTM-based optimization in terms of runtime. Specifically, in a real-time optimization problem of a real-world solar photovoltaic (PV) energy system at LHT Holdings in Singapore, ICLSTM-based optimization achieved an 8-fold speedup compared to conventional LSTM-based optimization. These results highlight the potential of ICLSTM networks to significantly enhance the efficiency of neural network-based optimization and control in practical applications.

Over the past few years, deep learning models especially Transformers have achieved advanced performance in LTSF tasks. However, LTSF faces inherent challenges such as long-term dependencies capturing and sparse semantic characteristics. Recently, a new state space model (SSM) named Mamba is proposed. With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba has shown great potential in balancing predicting performance and computational efficiency compared to Transformers. To enhance Mamba's ability to preserve historical information in a longer range, we design a novel Mamba+ block by adding a forget gate inside Mamba to selectively combine the new features with the historical features in a complementary manner. Furthermore, we apply Mamba+ both forward and backward and propose Bi-Mamba+, aiming to promote the model's ability to capture interactions among time series elements. Additionally, multivariate time series data in different scenarios may exhibit varying emphasis on intra- or inter-series dependencies. Therefore, we propose a series-relation-aware decider that controls the utilization of channel-independent or channel-mixing tokenization strategy for specific datasets. Extensive experiments on 8 real-world datasets show that our model achieves more accurate predictions compared with state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>New M...</summary><p>New Mamba-based architecture.

Existing methods primarily focus on optimizing LMs for a single reward function, limiting their adaptability to varied objectives. Here, we propose $\textbf{multi-objective decoding (MOD)}$, a decoding-time algorithm that outputs the next token from a linear combination of predictions of all base models, for any given weightings over different objectives. We exploit a common form among a family of $f$-divergence regularized alignment approaches (such as PPO, DPO, and their variants) to identify a closed-form solution by Legendre transform, and derive an efficient decoding strategy. Theoretically, we show why existing approaches can be sub-optimal even in natural settings and obtain optimality guarantees for our method. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm. For example, compared to a parameter-merging baseline, MOD achieves 12.8% overall reward improvement when equally optimizing towards $3$ objectives. Moreover, we experiment with MOD on combining three fully-finetuned LLMs of different model sizes, each aimed at different objectives such as safety, coding, and general user preference. Unlike traditional methods that require careful curation of a mixture of datasets to achieve comprehensive improvement, we can quickly experiment with preference weightings using MOD to find the best combination of models. Our best combination reduces toxicity on Toxigen to nearly 0% and achieves 7.9--33.3% improvement across other three metrics ($\textit{i.e.}$, Codex@1, GSM-COT, BBH-COT).</p></details> |  |
| **[System Identification for Continuous-time Linear Dynamical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.11933v3)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of system identification for the Kalman filter, relying on the expectation-maximization (EM) procedure to learn the underlying parameters of a dynamical system, has largely been studied assuming that observations are sampled at equally-spaced time points. However, in many applications this is a restrictive and unrealistic assumption. This paper addresses system identification for the continuous-discrete filter, with the aim of generalizing learning for the Kalman filter by relying on a solution to a continuous-time It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) for the latent state and covariance dynamics. We introduce a novel two-filter, analytical form for the posterior with a Bayesian derivation, which yields analytical updates which do not require the forward-pass to be pre-computed. Using this analytical and efficient computation of the posterior, we provide an EM procedure which estimates the parameters of the SDE, naturally incorporating irregularly sampled measurements. Generalizing the learning of latent linear dynamical systems (LDS) to continuous-time may extend the use of the hybrid Kalman filter to data which is not regularly sampled or has intermittent missing values, and can extend the power of non-linear system identification methods such as switching LDS (SLDS), which rely on EM for the linear discrete-time Kalman filter as a sub-unit for learning locally linearized behavior of a non-linear system. We apply the method by learning the parameters of a latent, multivariate Fokker-Planck SDE representing a toggle-switch genetic circuit using biologically realistic parameters, and compare the efficacy of learning relative to the discrete-time Kalman filter as the step-size irregularity and spectral-radius of the dynamics-matrix increases.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 3 figures.

As study complexity for participant interactions increases, translating study protocols to supporting application code becomes challenging. A collaboration exists between the University of Kentucky and Arizona State University to determine the efficacy of time-restricted eating in improving metabolic risk among postmenopausal women. This study utilizes a graph-based approach to monitor and support adherence to a designated schedule, enabling the validation and step-wise audit of participants' statuses to derive dependable conclusions. A texting service, driven by a participant graph, automatically manages interactions and collects data. Participant data is then accessible to the research study team via a website, which enables viewing, management, and exportation.

In contrast to existing benchmarks that focus on the visual quality and textual relevance of generated videos, ChronoMagic-Bench focuses on the model's ability to generate time-lapse videos with significant metamorphic amplitude and temporal coherence. The benchmark probes T2V models for their physics, biology, and chemistry capabilities, in a free-form text query. For these purposes, ChronoMagic-Bench introduces 1,649 prompts and real-world videos as references, categorized into four major types of time-lapse videos: biological, human-created, meteorological, and physical phenomena, which are further divided into 75 subcategories. This categorization comprehensively evaluates the model's capacity to handle diverse and complex transformations. To accurately align human preference with the benchmark, we introduce two new automatic metrics, MTScore and CHScore, to evaluate the videos' metamorphic attributes and temporal coherence. MTScore measures the metamorphic amplitude, reflecting the degree of change over time, while CHScore assesses the temporal coherence, ensuring the generated videos maintain logical progression and continuity. Based on the ChronoMagic-Bench, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of ten representative T2V models, revealing their strengths and weaknesses across different categories of prompts, and providing a thorough evaluation framework that addresses current gaps in video generation research. Moreover, we create a large-scale ChronoMagic-Pro dataset, containing 460k high-quality pairs of 720p time-lapse videos and detailed captions ensuring high physical pertinence and large metamorphic amplitude.</p></details> | 31 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A simple deterministic near-linear time approximation scheme for transshipment with arbitrary positive edge costs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07440v3)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a simple deterministic near-linear time approximation scheme for uncapacitated minimum cost flow in undirected graphs with real edge weights, a problem also known as transshipment. Specifically, our algorithm takes as input a (connected) undirected graph $G = (V, E)$, vertex demands $b \in \mathbb{R}^V$ such that $\sum_{v \in V} b(v) = 0$, positive edge costs $c \in \mathbb{R}_{>0}^E$, and a parameter $\varepsilon > 0$. In $O(\varepsilon^{-2} m \log^{O(1)} n)$ time, it returns a flow $f$ such that the net flow out of each vertex is equal to the vertex's demand and the cost of the flow is within a $(1 + \varepsilon)$ factor of optimal. Our algorithm is combinatorial and has no running time dependency on the demands or edge costs. With the exception of a recent result presented at STOC 2022 for polynomially bounded edge weights, all almost- and near-linear time approximation schemes for transshipment relied on randomization to embed the problem instance into low-dimensional space. Our algorithm instead deterministically approximates the cost of routing decisions that would be made if the input were subject to a random tree embedding. To avoid computing the $\Omega(n^2)$ vertex-vertex distances that an approximation of this kind suggests, we also take advantage of the clustering method used in the well-known Thorup-Zwick distance oracle.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for ESA 2024 v3: ESA 2024 reviewer suggestions</p></details> |
| **[ICTSurF: Implicit Continuous-Time Survival Functions with Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05818v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Survival analysis is a widely known method for predicting the likelihood of an event over time. The challenge of dealing with censored samples still remains. Traditional methods, such as the Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model, hinge on the limitations due to the strong assumptions of proportional hazards and the predetermined relationships between covariates. The rise of models based on deep neural networks (DNNs) has demonstrated enhanced effectiveness in survival analysis. This research introduces the Implicit Continuous-Time Survival Function (ICTSurF), built on a continuous-time survival model, and constructs survival distribution through implicit representation. As a result, our method is capable of accepting inputs in continuous-time space and producing survival probabilities in continuous-time space, independent of neural network architecture. Comparative assessments with existing methods underscore the high competitiveness of our proposed approach. Our implementation of ICTSurF is available at https://github.com/44REAM/ICTSurF.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the stability and robustness of frequently utilized time-discretization numerical schemes for solving the Allen-Cahn equation, with focuses on the Backward Euler, Crank-Nicolson (CN), convex splitting of modified CN, and Diagonally Implicit Runge-Kutta (DIRK) methods. Our stability analysis reveals that the Convex Splitting of the Modified CN scheme exhibits unconditional stability, allowing greater flexibility in time step selection, while the other schemes are conditionally stable. Additionally, our robustness analysis highlights that the Backward Euler method converges to correct physical solutions regardless of initial conditions. In contrast, the other methods studied in this work show sensitivity to initial conditions and may converge to incorrect physical solutions if the initial conditions are not carefully chosen. This study introduces a comprehensive approach to assessing stability and robustness in numerical methods for solving the Allen-Cahn equation, providing a new perspective for evaluating numerical techniques for general nonlinear differential equations.</p></details> |  |

ITI operates by shifting model activations during inference, following a set of directions across a limited number of attention heads. This intervention significantly improves the performance of LLaMA models on the TruthfulQA benchmark. On an instruction-finetuned LLaMA called Alpaca, ITI improves its truthfulness from 32.5% to 65.1%. We identify a tradeoff between truthfulness and helpfulness and demonstrate how to balance it by tuning the intervention strength. ITI is minimally invasive and computationally inexpensive. Moreover, the technique is data efficient: while approaches like RLHF require extensive annotations, ITI locates truthful directions using only few hundred examples. Our findings suggest that LLMs may have an internal representation of the likelihood of something being true, even as they produce falsehoods on the surface.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2023 spotlight; code: https://github.com/likenneth/honest_llama</p></details> |

In particular, this study addresses to the analysis of transit-time ultrasonic meters which rely on the propagation of acoustic waves to measure fluids flow rate. Accurate and efficient simulations of the physics related to the transport of ultrasounds are therefore crucial for studying and enhancing these devices. Starting from the description of the linearized Euler equations (LEE) model and presenting the general theory of explicit-time DG methods for hyperbolic systems, we then motivate the use of a spectral basis and introduce a novel high-accuracy method for the imposition of absorbing and resistive walls which analyses the incident wave direction across the boundary surface. The proposed implementation is both accurate and efficient, making it suitable for industrial applications of acoustic wave propagation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Early Classification of Time Series: Taxonomy and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18332v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many situations, the measurements of a studied phenomenon are provided sequentially, and the prediction of its class needs to be made as early as possible so as not to incur too high a time penalty, but not too early and risk paying the cost of misclassification. This problem has been particularly studied in the case of time series, and is known as Early Classification of Time Series (ECTS). Although it has been the subject of a growing body of literature, there is still a lack of a systematic, shared evaluation protocol to compare the relative merits of the various existing methods. This document begins by situating these methods within a principle-based taxonomy. It defines dimensions for organizing their evaluation, and then reports the results of a very extensive set of experiments along these dimensions involving nine state-of-the art ECTS algorithms. In addition, these and other experiments can be carried out using an open-source library in which most of the existing ECTS algorithms have been implemented (see \url{https://github.com/ML-EDM/ml_edm}).</p></details> |  |

Prior methods, such as DynamicNeRF, have shown impressive performance by leveraging time-varying dynamic radiation fields. However, these methods have limitations when it comes to accurately modeling the motion of complex objects, which can lead to inaccurate and blurry renderings of details. To address this limitation, we propose a novel approach that builds upon a recent generalization NeRF, which aggregates nearby views onto new viewpoints. However, such methods are typically only effective for static scenes. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a module that operates in both the time and frequency domains to aggregate the features of object motion. This allows us to learn the relationship between frames and generate higher-quality images. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods on dynamic scene datasets. Specifically, our approach outperforms existing methods in terms of both the accuracy and visual quality of the synthesized views.

Previous methods have achieved remarkable progress in audio-visual synchronization, but there is still a significant gap between current results and practical applications. The challenges are two-fold: 1) Preserving unique individual traits for achieving high-precision lip synchronization. 2) Generating high-quality facial renderings in real-time performance. In this paper, we propose a novel generalized audio-driven framework RealTalk, which consists of an audio-to-expression transformer and a high-fidelity expression-to-face renderer. In the first component, we consider both identity and intra-personal variation features related to speaking lip movements. By incorporating cross-modal attention on the enriched facial priors, we can effectively align lip movements with audio, thus attaining greater precision in expression prediction. In the second component, we design a lightweight facial identity alignment (FIA) module which includes a lip-shape control structure and a face texture reference structure. This novel design allows us to generate fine details in real-time, without depending on sophisticated and inefficient feature alignment modules. Our experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, on public datasets demonstrate the clear advantages of our method in terms of lip-speech synchronization and generation quality. Furthermore, our method is efficient and requires fewer computational resources, making it well-suited to meet the needs of practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Meta-Learning Method for Estimation of Causal Excursion Effects to Assess Time-Varying Moderation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16297v2)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Twin revolutions in wearable technologies and health interventions delivered by smartphones have greatly increased the accessibility of mobile health (mHealth) interventions. Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) are designed to assess the effectiveness of the mHealth intervention and introduce a novel class of causal estimands called "causal excursion effects." These estimands enable the evaluation of how intervention effects change over time and are influenced by individual characteristics or context. However, existing analysis methods for causal excursion effects require prespecified features of the observed high-dimensional history to build a working model for a critical nuisance parameter. Machine learning appears ideal for automatic feature construction, but their naive application can lead to bias under model misspecification. To address this issue, this paper revisits the estimation of causal excursion effects from a meta-learner perspective, where the analyst remains agnostic to the supervised learning algorithms used to estimate nuisance parameters. We present the bidirectional asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators and compare them both theoretically and through extensive simulations. The results show relative efficiency gains and support the suggestion of a doubly robust alternative to existing methods. Finally, the proposed methods' practical utilities are demonstrated by analyzing data from a multi-institution cohort of first-year medical residents in the United States (NeCamp et al., 2020).</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Structure Flow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18031v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article introduces the structure flow field; a flow field that can provide high-speed robo-centric motion information for motion control of highly dynamic robotic devices and autonomous vehicles. Structure flow is the angular 3D velocity of the scene at a given pixel. We show that structure flow posses an elegant evolution model in the form of a Partial Differential Equation (PDE) that enables us to create dense flow predictions forward in time. We exploit this structure to design a predictor-update algorithm to compute structure flow in real time using image and depth measurements. The prediction stage takes the previous estimate of the structure flow and propagates it forward in time using a numerical implementation of the structure flow PDE. The predicted flow is then updated using new image and depth data. The algorithm runs up to 600 Hz on a Desktop GPU machine for 512x512 images with flow values up to 8 pixels. We provide ground truth validation on high-speed synthetic image sequences as well as results on real-life video on driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Finite-Time Analysis of TD Learning with Linear Function Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02476v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the finite-time convergence of TD learning with linear function approximation under Markovian sampling. Existing proofs for this setting either assume a projection step in the algorithm to simplify the analysis, or require a fairly intricate argument to ensure stability of the iterates. We ask: \textit{Is it possible to retain the simplicity of a projection-based analysis without actually performing a projection step in the algorithm?} Our main contribution is to show this is possible via a novel two-step argument. In the first step, we use induction to prove that under a standard choice of a constant step-size $\alpha$, the iterates generated by TD learning remain uniformly bounded in expectation. In the second step, we establish a recursion that mimics the steady-state dynamics of TD learning up to a bounded perturbation on the order of $O(\alpha^2)$ that captures the effect of Markovian sampling. Combining these pieces leads to an overall approach that considerably simplifies existing proofs. We conjecture that our inductive proof technique will find applications in the analyses of more complex stochastic approximation algorithms, and conclude by providing some examples of such applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounding Stochastic Safety: Leveraging Freedman's Inequality with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05745v4)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical robust safety methods achieve their guarantees by always assuming that the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) and c-martingales to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive safety constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as input-to-state safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is stronger. Finally, we present simulation examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

This combination allows for a more comprehensive and flexible representation of sequential and temporal data. We demonstrate through studies that our SigKANs with learnable path signatures perform better than conventional methods across a range of function approximation challenges. By leveraging path signatures in neural networks, this method offers intriguing opportunities to enhance performance in time series analysis and time series forecasting, among other fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.07344, arXiv:2406.02486</p></details> |

However, the resource-intensive nature of these models poses challenges for deployment on low-computational power and low-memory devices, like embedded and edge devices. This work empirically investigates the optimization of such complex DL models to analyze their functionality on an embedded device, particularly on the NVIDIA Jetson Nano. It evaluates the effectiveness of the optimized models in terms of their inference speed for image classification and video action detection. The experimental results reveal that, on average, optimized models exhibit a 16.11% speed improvement over their non-optimized counterparts. This not only emphasizes the critical need to consider hardware constraints and environmental sustainability in model development and deployment but also underscores the pivotal role of model optimization in enabling the widespread deployment of AI-assisted technologies on resource-constrained computational systems. It also serves as proof that prioritizing hardware-specific model optimization leads to efficient and scalable solutions that substantially decrease energy consumption and carbon footprint.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Reward Steering with Evolutionary Heuristics for Decoding-time Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15193v3)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread applicability and increasing omnipresence of LLMs have instigated a need to align LLM responses to user and stakeholder preferences. Many preference optimization approaches have been proposed that fine-tune LLM parameters to achieve good alignment. However, such parameter tuning is known to interfere with model performance on many tasks. Moreover, keeping up with shifting user preferences is tricky in such a situation. Decoding-time alignment with reward model guidance solves these issues at the cost of increased inference time. However, most of such methods fail to strike the right balance between exploration and exploitation of reward -- often due to the conflated formulation of these two aspects - to give well-aligned responses. To remedy this we decouple these two aspects and implement them in an evolutionary fashion: exploration is enforced by decoding from mutated instructions and exploitation is represented as the periodic replacement of poorly-rewarded generations with well-rewarded ones. Empirical evidences indicate that this strategy outperforms many preference optimization and decode-time alignment approaches on two widely accepted alignment benchmarks AlpacaEval 2 and MT-Bench. Our implementation will be available at: https://darwin-alignment.github.io.</p></details> |  |

The extremum graph is a substructure of the Morse-Smale complex. It captures the adjacency relationship between cells in the Morse decomposition of a scalar field. We define the TVEG as a time-varying extension of the extremum graph and demonstrate how it captures salient feature tracks within a dynamic scalar field. We formulate the construction of the TVEG as an optimization problem and describe an algorithm for computing the graph. We also demonstrate the capabilities of \TVEG towards identification and exploration of topological events such as deletion, generation, split, and merge within a dynamic scalar field via comprehensive case studies including a viscous fingers and a 3D von K\'arm\'an vortex street dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[BayTTA: Uncertainty-aware medical image classification with optimized test-time augmentation using Bayesian model averaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17640v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time augmentation (TTA) is a well-known technique employed during the testing phase of computer vision tasks. It involves aggregating multiple augmented versions of input data. Combining predictions using a simple average formulation is a common and straightforward approach after performing TTA. This paper introduces a novel framework for optimizing TTA, called BayTTA (Bayesian-based TTA), which is based on Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). First, we generate a model list associated with different variations of the input data created through TTA. Then, we use BMA to combine model predictions weighted by their respective posterior probabilities. Such an approach allows one to take into account model uncertainty, and thus to enhance the predictive performance of the related machine learning or deep learning model. We evaluate the performance of BayTTA on various public data, including three medical image datasets comprising skin cancer, breast cancer, and chest X-ray images and two well-known gene editing datasets, CRISPOR and GUIDE-seq. Our experimental results indicate that BayTTA can be effectively integrated into state-of-the-art deep learning models used in medical image analysis as well as into some popular pre-trained CNN models such as VGG-16, MobileNetV2, DenseNet201, ResNet152V2, and InceptionRes-NetV2, leading to the enhancement in their accuracy and robustness performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Querying Labeled Time Series Data with Scenario Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17627v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to ensure autonomous vehicles are safe for on-road deployment, simulation-based testing has become an integral complement to on-road testing. The rise in simulation testing and validation reflects a growing need to verify that AV behavior is consistent with desired outcomes even in edge case scenarios $-$ which may seldom or never appear in on-road testing data. This raises a critical question: to what extent are AV failures in simulation consistent with data collected from real-world testing? As a result of the gap between simulated and real sensor data (sim-to-real gap), failures in simulation can either be spurious (simulation- or simulator-specific issues) or relevant (safety-critical AV system issues). One possible method for validating if simulated time series failures are consistent with real world time series sensor data could involve retrieving instances of the failure scenario from a real-world time series dataset, in order to understand AV performance in these scenarios. Adopting this strategy, we propose a formal definition of what constitutes a match between a real-world labeled time series data item and a simulated scenario written from a fragment of the Scenic probabilistic programming language for simulation generation. With this definition of a match, we develop a querying algorithm that identifies the subset of a labeled time series dataset matching a given scenario. To allow this approach to be used to verify the safety of other cyber-physical systems (CPS), we present a definition and algorithm for matching scalable beyond the autonomous vehicles domain. Experiments demonstrate the precision and scalability of the algorithm for a set of challenging and uncommon time series scenarios identified from the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset. We include a full system implementation of the querying algorithm freely available for use across a wide range of CPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 6 figures, 5 algorithms.

Instead of employing hand-crafted transforms or functions on the input test image to create multiple views for test-time augmentation, we advocate for the utilization of an advanced domain-fine-tuned generative model (GM), e.g., stable diffusion (SD), for test-time augmentation. Given that the GM has been trained to comprehend and encapsulate comprehensive domain data knowledge, it is superior than segmentation models in terms of representing the data characteristics and distribution. Hence, by integrating the GM into test-time augmentation, we can effectively generate multiple views of a given test sample, aligning with the content and appearance characteristics of the sample and the related local data distribution. This approach renders the augmentation process more adaptable and resilient compared to conventional handcrafted transforms. Comprehensive experiments conducted across three medical image segmentation tasks (nine datasets) demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed TTGA in enhancing segmentation outcomes. Moreover, TTGA significantly improves pixel-wise error estimation, thereby facilitating the deployment of a more reliable segmentation system. Code will be released at: https://github.com/maxiao0234/TTGA.</p></details> | 12pages, 2figures |

Previous studies typically focus on specific aspects of time, lacking a comprehensive temporal reasoning benchmark. To address this, we propose TimeBench, a comprehensive hierarchical temporal reasoning benchmark that covers a broad spectrum of temporal reasoning phenomena. TimeBench provides a thorough evaluation for investigating the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models. We conduct extensive experiments on GPT-4, LLaMA2, and other popular LLMs under various settings. Our experimental results indicate a significant performance gap between the state-of-the-art LLMs and humans, highlighting that there is still a considerable distance to cover in temporal reasoning. Besides, LLMs exhibit capability discrepancies across different reasoning categories. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyze the impact of multiple aspects on temporal reasoning and emphasize the associated challenges.

Its primary objective is to learn the normal patterns of time series data, thereby identifying deviations in test samples. Most existing TSAD methods focus on modeling data from the temporal dimension, while ignoring the semantic information in the spatial dimension. To address this issue, we introduce a novel approach, called Spatial-Temporal Normality learning (STEN). STEN is composed of a sequence Order prediction-based Temporal Normality learning (OTN) module that captures the temporal correlations within sequences, and a Distance prediction-based Spatial Normality learning (DSN) module that learns the relative spatial relations between sequences in a feature space. By synthesizing these two modules, STEN learns expressive spatial-temporal representations for the normal patterns hidden in the time series data. Extensive experiments on five popular TSAD benchmarks show that STEN substantially outperforms state-of-the-art competing methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/mala-lab/STEN.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, accepted in ECML PKDD2024</p></details> |

The scene classification layer (SCL) inside the S2 product provides rich information for training, such as filtering images with high cloud coverage. However, there is more potential in this. We propose a technique to assess the clean optical coverage of a region, expressed by a SITS and calculated with the S2-based SCL data. With a manual threshold and specific labels in the SCL, the proposed technique assigns a percentage of spatial and temporal coverage across the time series and a high/low assessment. By evaluating the AI4EO challenge for Enhanced Agriculture, we show that the assessment is correlated to the predictive results of ML models. The classification results in a region with low spatial and temporal coverage is worse than in a region with high coverage. Finally, we applied the technique across all continents of the global dataset LandCoverNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium 2024</p></details> |
| **[Directly Training Temporal Spiking Neural Network with Sparse Surrogate Gradient](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19645v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have attracted much attention due to their event-based computing and energy-efficient features. However, the spiking all-or-none nature has prevented direct training of SNNs for various applications. The surrogate gradient (SG) algorithm has recently enabled spiking neural networks to shine in neuromorphic hardware. However, introducing surrogate gradients has caused SNNs to lose their original sparsity, thus leading to the potential performance loss. In this paper, we first analyze the current problem of direct training using SGs and then propose Masked Surrogate Gradients (MSGs) to balance the effectiveness of training and the sparseness of the gradient, thereby improving the generalization ability of SNNs. Moreover, we introduce a temporally weighted output (TWO) method to decode the network output, reinforcing the importance of correct timesteps. Extensive experiments on diverse network structures and datasets show that training with MSG and TWO surpasses the SOTA technique.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel cell tracking algorithm named DenseTrack, which integrates deep learning with mathematical model-based strategies to effectively establish correspondences between consecutive frames and detect cell division events in crowded scenarios. We formulate the cell tracking problem as a deep learning-based temporal sequence classification task followed by solving a constrained one-to-one matching optimization problem exploiting the classifier's confidence scores. Additionally, we present an eigendecomposition-based cell division detection strategy that leverages knowledge of cellular geometry. The performance of the proposed approach has been evaluated by tracking densely packed cells in 3D time-lapse image sequences of bacterial biofilm development. The experimental results on simulated as well as experimental fluorescence image sequences suggest that the proposed tracking method achieves superior performance in terms of both qualitative and quantitative evaluation measures compared to recent state-of-the-art cell tracking approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context Matters: An Empirical Study of the Impact of Contextual Information in Temporal Question Answering Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19538v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with temporal reasoning, crucial for tasks like historical event analysis and time-sensitive information retrieval. Despite advancements, state-of-the-art models falter in handling temporal information, especially when faced with irrelevant or noisy contexts. This paper addresses this gap by empirically examining the robustness of temporal question-answering (TQA) systems trained on various context types, including relevant, irrelevant, slightly altered, and no context. Our findings indicate that training with a mix of these contexts enhances model robustness and accuracy. Additionally, we show that the position of context relative to the question significantly impacts performance, with question-first positioning yielding better results. We introduce two new context-rich TQA datasets, ContextAQA and ContextTQE, and provide comprehensive evaluations and guidelines for training robust TQA models. Our work lays the foundation for developing reliable and context-aware temporal QA systems, with broader implications for enhancing LLM robustness against diverse and potentially adversarial information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distance to Transitivity: New Parameters for Taming Reachability in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19514v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A temporal graph is a graph whose edges only appear at certain points in time. Reachability in these graphs is defined in terms of paths that traverse the edges in chronological order (temporal paths). This form of reachability is neither symmetric nor transitive, the latter having important consequences on the computational complexity of even basic questions, such as computing temporal connected components. In this paper, we introduce several parameters that capture how far a temporal graph $\mathcal{G}$ is from being transitive, namely, \emph{vertex-deletion distance to transitivity} and \emph{arc-modification distance to transitivity}, both being applied to the reachability graph of $\mathcal{G}$. We illustrate the impact of these parameters on the temporal connected component problem, obtaining several tractability results in terms of fixed-parameter tractability and polynomial kernels. Significantly, these results are obtained without restrictions of the underlying graph, the snapshots, or the lifetime of the input graph. As such, our results isolate the impact of non-transitivity and confirm the key role that it plays in the hardness of temporal graph problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Finite Sample Performance of Causal Discovery by Exploiting Temporal Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19503v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods of causal discovery aim to identify causal structures in a data driven way. Existing algorithms are known to be unstable and sensitive to statistical errors, and are therefore rarely used with biomedical or epidemiological data. We present an algorithm that efficiently exploits temporal structure, so-called tiered background knowledge, for estimating causal structures. Tiered background knowledge is readily available from, e.g., cohort or registry data. When used efficiently it renders the algorithm more robust to statistical errors and ultimately increases accuracy in finite samples. We describe the algorithm and illustrate how it proceeds. Moreover, we offer formal proofs as well as examples of desirable properties of the algorithm, which we demonstrate empirically in an extensive simulation study. To illustrate its usefulness in practice, we apply the algorithm to data from a children's cohort study investigating the interplay of diet, physical activity and other lifestyle factors for health outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Video-Language Representations with Structural Spatio-Temporal Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19255v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-training large-scale video-language models (VLMs) has shown remarkable potential for various downstream video-language tasks, existing VLMs can still suffer from certain commonly seen limitations, e.g., coarse-grained cross-modal aligning , under-modeling of temporal dynamics, detached video-language view. In this work, we target enhancing VLMs with a fine-grained structural spatio-temporal alignment learning method (namely Finsta). First of all, we represent the input texts and videos with fine-grained scene graph (SG) structures, both of which are further unified into a holistic SG (HSG) for bridging two modalities. Then, an SG-based framework is built, where the textual SG (TSG) is encoded with a graph Transformer, while the video dynamic SG (DSG) and the HSG are modeled with a novel recurrent graph Transformer for spatial and temporal feature propagation. A spatial-temporal Gaussian differential graph Transformer is further devised to strengthen the sense of the changes in objects across spatial and temporal dimensions. Next, based on the fine-grained structural features of TSG and DSG, we perform object-centered spatial alignment and predicate-centered temporal alignment respectively, enhancing the video-language grounding in both the spatiality and temporality. We design our method as a plug&play system, which can be integrated into existing well-trained VLMs for further representation augmentation, without training from scratch or relying on SG annotations in downstream applications. On 6 representative VL modeling tasks over 12 datasets in both standard and long-form video scenarios, Finsta consistently improves the existing 13 strong-performing VLMs persistently, and refreshes the current state-of-the-art end task performance significantly in both the fine-tuning and zero-shot settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TPAMI 2024</p></details> |

CD involves utilizing bi-temporal images to identify changes over time. The bi-temporal spatial relationships between features at the same location at different times play a key role in this process. However, existing change detection networks often do not fully leverage these spatial relationships during bi-temporal feature extraction and fusion. In this work, we propose SRC-Net: a bi-temporal spatial relationship concerned network for CD. The proposed SRC-Net includes a Perception and Interaction Module that incorporates spatial relationships and establishes a cross-branch perception mechanism to enhance the precision and robustness of feature extraction. Additionally, a Patch-Mode joint Feature Fusion Module is introduced to address information loss in current methods. It considers different change modes and concerns about spatial relationships, resulting in more expressive fusion features. Furthermore, we construct a novel network using these two relationship concerned modules and conducted experiments on the LEVIR-CD and WHU Building datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our network outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods while maintaining a modest parameter count. We believe our approach sets a new paradigm for change detection and will inspire further advancements in the field.

However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning. The code and datasets of STBench are released on https://github.com/LwbXc/STBench.</p></details> |  |

Blind modulation identification is its key building block, which blindly identifies the modulation type of an incompatible signal without any prior knowledge. Recent blind modulation identification schemes are built upon deep neural networks, which are limited to single-carrier signal recognition thus not pragmatic for identifying spectro-temporal OFDMA signals whose modulation varies with time and frequency. Therefore, this paper proposes RiSi, a semantic segmentation neural network designed to work on OFDMA's spectrograms, that employs flattened convolutions to better identify the grid-like pattern of OFDMA's resource blocks. We trained RiSi with a realistic OFDMA dataset including various channel impairments, and achieved the modulation identification accuracy of 86% on average over four modulation types of BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM. Then, we enhanced the generalization performance of RiSi by applying domain generalization methods while treating varying FFT size or varying CP length as different domains, showing that thus-generalized RiSi can perform reasonably well with unseen data.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, in Proceedings of IEEE WoWMoM 2024</p></details> |

Given a collection of observed temporal graphs, is it possible to predict the evolution of an unseen network from the same domain? To answer this question, we first present the Temporal Graph Scaling (TGS) dataset, a large collection of temporal graphs consisting of eighty-four ERC20 token transaction networks collected from 2017 to 2023. Next, we evaluate the transferability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for the temporal graph property prediction task by pre-training on a collection of up to sixty-four token transaction networks and then evaluating the downstream performance on twenty unseen token networks. We find that the neural scaling law observed in NLP and Computer Vision also applies in temporal graph learning, where pre-training on greater number of networks leads to improved downstream performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of the transferability of temporal graphs learning. On downstream token networks, the largest pre-trained model outperforms single model TGNNs on thirteen unseen test networks. Therefore, we believe that this is a promising first step towards building foundation models for temporal graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 15 figures, preprint version</p></details> |

This behavior is captured by the temporal graphs model, which has recently become a trending topic in theoretical computer science. A core open problem in the field is to prove the existence of linear-size temporal spanners in temporal cliques, i.e., sparse subgraphs of complete temporal graphs that ensure all-pairs reachability via temporal paths. So far, the best known result is the existence of temporal spanners with $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ many edges. We present significant progress towards proving that linear-size temporal spanners exist in all temporal cliques. We adapt techniques used in previous works and heavily expand and generalize them to provide a simpler and more intuitive proof of the $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ bound. Moreover, we use our novel approach to show that a large class of temporal cliques, called edge-pivot graphs, admit linear-size temporal spanners. To contrast this, we investigate other classes of temporal cliques that do not belong to the class of edge-pivot graphs. We introduce two such graph classes and we develop novel techniques for establishing the existence of linear temporal spanners in these graph classes as well.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

Though super-resolution (SR) techniques can alleviate this problem, existing deep learning models recover pathology image in a black-box manner, which can lead to untruthful biological details and misdiagnosis. Additionally, current methods allocate the same computational resources to recover each pixel of pathology image, leading to the sub-optimal recovery issue due to the large variation of pathology image. In this paper, we propose the first hierarchical reinforcement learning framework named Spatial-Temporal hierARchical Reinforcement Learning (STAR-RL), mainly for addressing the aforementioned issues in pathology image super-resolution problem. We reformulate the SR problem as a Markov decision process of interpretable operations and adopt the hierarchical recovery mechanism in patch level, to avoid sub-optimal recovery. Specifically, the higher-level spatial manager is proposed to pick out the most corrupted patch for the lower-level patch worker. Moreover, the higher-level temporal manager is advanced to evaluate the selected patch and determine whether the optimization should be stopped earlier, thereby avoiding the over-processed problem. Under the guidance of spatial-temporal managers, the lower-level patch worker processes the selected patch with pixel-wise interpretable actions at each time step. Experimental results on medical images degraded by different kernels show the effectiveness of STAR-RL. Furthermore, STAR-RL validates the promotion in tumor diagnosis with a large margin and shows generalizability under various degradations.

However, both architectures have inherent shortcomings: CNN are constrained by a limited receptive field that may hinder their ability to capture broader spatial contexts, while Transformers are computationally intensive, making them costly to train and deploy on large datasets. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on state space models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing CD tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge Visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features, thereby obtaining accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex training strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture in CD tasks. Further experiments show that our architecture is quite robust to degraded data.

However, collecting, preprocessing, and annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since it is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present change data generators based on generative models, which are cheap and automatic, alleviating these data problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic change process over time. We describe the stochastic change process as a probabilistic graphical model (GPCM), which factorizes the complex simulation problem into two more tractable sub-problems, i.e., change event simulation and semantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present Changen2, a GPCM with a resolution-scalable diffusion transformer which can generate time series of images and their semantic and change labels from labeled or unlabeled single-temporal images. Changen2 is a generative change foundation model that can be trained at scale via self-supervision, and can produce change supervisory signals from unlabeled single-temporal images. Unlike existing foundation models, Changen2 synthesizes change data to train task-specific foundation models for change detection. The resulting model possesses inherent zero-shot change detection capabilities and excellent transferability. Experiments suggest Changen2 has superior spatiotemporal scalability, e.g., Changen2 model trained on 256$^2$ pixel single-temporal images can yield time series of any length and resolutions of 1,024$^2$ pixels. Changen2 pre-trained models exhibit superior zero-shot performance (narrowing the performance gap to 3% on LEVIR-CD and approximately 10% on both S2Looking and SECOND, compared to fully supervised counterparts) and transferability across multiple types of change tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The enhanced extension of our ICCV 2023 (Changen)</p></details> |

They usually need to be adjusted before being used in impact studies. The suite of statistical methods that enable such adjustments is called bias correction (BC). However, BC methods currently struggle to adjust temporal biases. Because they mostly disregard the dependence between consecutive time points. As a result, climate statistics with long-range temporal properties, such as heatwave duration and frequency, cannot be corrected accurately. This makes it more difficult to produce reliable impact studies on such climate statistics. This paper offers a novel BC methodology to correct temporal biases. This is made possible by rethinking the philosophy behind BC. We will introduce BC as a time-indexed regression task with stochastic outputs. Rethinking BC enables us to adapt state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) attention models and thereby learn different types of biases, including temporal asynchronicities. With a case study of heatwave duration statistics in Abuja, Nigeria, and Tokyo, Japan, we show more accurate results than current climate model outputs and alternative BC methods.</p></details> | 38 pages, 31 figures |

While the problem has been studied extensively in static networks, much remains to be explored for temporal networks. In this work we introduce the novel problem of identifying the temporal motif densest subnetwork, i.e., the densest subnetwork with respect to temporal motifs, which are high-order patterns characterizing temporal networks. This problem significantly differs from analogous formulations for dense temporal (or static) subnetworks as these do not account for temporal motifs. Identifying temporal motifs is an extremely challenging task, and thus, efficient methods are required. To this end, we design two novel randomized approximation algorithms with rigorous probabilistic guarantees that provide high-quality solutions. We perform extensive experiments showing that our methods outperform baselines. Furthermore, our algorithms scale on networks with up to billions of temporal edges, while baselines cannot handle such large networks. We use our techniques to analyze a financial network and show that our formulation reveals important network structures, such as bursty temporal events and communities of users with similar interests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the accepted KDD'24 paper</p></details> |

Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in many fields, including criminal analysis and psychotherapy. However, MER is challenging since MEs have low intensity and ME datasets are small in size. To this end, a three-stream temporal-shift attention network based on self-knowledge distillation (SKD-TSTSAN) is proposed in this paper. Firstly, to address the low intensity of ME muscle movements, we utilize learning-based motion magnification modules to enhance the intensity of ME muscle movements. Secondly, we employ efficient channel attention (ECA) modules in the local-spatial stream to make the network focus on facial regions that are highly relevant to MEs. In addition, temporal shift modules (TSMs) are used in the dynamic-temporal stream, which enables temporal modeling with no additional parameters by mixing ME motion information from two different temporal domains. Furthermore, we introduce self-knowledge distillation (SKD) into the MER task by introducing auxiliary classifiers and using the deepest section of the network for supervision, encouraging all blocks to fully explore the features of the training set. Finally, extensive experiments are conducted on four ME datasets: CASME II, SAMM, MMEW, and CAS(ME)3. The experimental results demonstrate that our SKD-TSTSAN outperforms other existing methods and achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be available at https://github.com/GuanghaoZhu663/SKD-TSTSAN.</p></details> |  |

Remote sensing has the potential to mitigate these effects by supporting sustainable development strategies with accurate information on urban growth. Deep learning-based methods have achieved promising urban change detection results from optical satellite image pairs using convolutional neural networks (ConvNets), transformers, and a multi-task learning setup. However, transformers have not been leveraged for urban change detection with multi-temporal data, i.e., >2 images, and multi-task learning methods lack integration approaches that combine change and segmentation outputs. To fill this research gap, we propose a continuous urban change detection method that identifies changes in each consecutive image pair of a satellite image time series. Specifically, we propose a temporal feature refinement (TFR) module that utilizes self-attention to improve ConvNet-based multi-temporal building representations. Furthermore, we propose a multi-task integration (MTI) module that utilizes Markov networks to find an optimal building map time series based on segmentation and dense change outputs. The proposed method effectively identifies urban changes based on high-resolution satellite image time series acquired by the PlanetScope constellation (F1 score 0.551) and Gaofen-2 (F1 score 0.440). Moreover, our experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to bi-temporal and multi-temporal urban change detection and segmentation methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, Code will be available at https://github.com/SebastianHafner/ContUrbanCD.git</p></details> |
| **[Constructing Behavior Trees from Temporal Plans for Robotic Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17379v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Executing temporal plans in the real and open world requires adapting to uncertainty both in the environment and in the plan actions. A plan executor must therefore be flexible to dispatch actions based on the actual execution conditions. In general, this involves considering both event and time-based constraints between the actions in the plan. A simple temporal network (STN) is a convenient framework for specifying the constraints between actions in the plan. Likewise, a behavior tree (BT) is a convenient framework for controlling the execution flow of the actions in the plan. The principle contributions of this paper are i) an algorithm for transforming a plan into an STN, and ii) an algorithm for transforming an STN into a BT. When combined, these algorithms define a systematic approach for executing total-order (time-triggered) plans in robots operating in the real world. Our approach is based on creating a graph describing a deordered (state-triggered) plan and then creating a BT representing a partial-order (determined at runtime) plan. This approach ensures the correct execution of plans, including those with required concurrency. We demonstrate the validity of our approach within the PlanSys2 framework on real robots.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal-Channel Modeling in Multi-head Self-Attention for Synthetic Speech Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17376v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent synthetic speech detectors leveraging the Transformer model have superior performance compared to the convolutional neural network counterparts. This improvement could be due to the powerful modeling ability of the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in the Transformer model, which learns the temporal relationship of each input token. However, artifacts of synthetic speech can be located in specific regions of both frequency channels and temporal segments, while MHSA neglects this temporal-channel dependency of the input sequence. In this work, we proposed a Temporal-Channel Modeling (TCM) module to enhance MHSA's capability for capturing temporal-channel dependencies. Experimental results on the ASVspoof 2021 show that with only 0.03M additional parameters, the TCM module can outperform the state-of-the-art system by 9.25% in EER. Further ablation study reveals that utilizing both temporal and channel information yields the most improvement for detecting synthetic speech.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Prototype-Aware Learning for Active Voltage Control on Power Distribution Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17818v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active Voltage Control (AVC) on the Power Distribution Networks (PDNs) aims to stabilize the voltage levels to ensure efficient and reliable operation of power systems. With the increasing integration of distributed energy resources, recent efforts have explored employing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) techniques to realize effective AVC. Existing methods mainly focus on the acquisition of short-term AVC strategies, i.e., only learning AVC within the short-term training trajectories of a singular diurnal cycle. However, due to the dynamic nature of load demands and renewable energy, the operation states of real-world PDNs may exhibit significant distribution shifts across varying timescales (e.g., daily and seasonal changes). This can render those short-term strategies suboptimal or even obsolete when performing continuous AVC over extended periods. In this paper, we propose a novel temporal prototype-aware learning method, abbreviated as TPA, to learn time-adaptive AVC under short-term training trajectories. At the heart of TPA are two complementary components, namely multi-scale dynamic encoder and temporal prototype-aware policy, that can be readily incorporated into various MARL methods. The former component integrates a stacked transformer network to learn underlying temporal dependencies at different timescales of the PDNs, while the latter implements a learnable prototype matching mechanism to construct a dedicated AVC policy that can dynamically adapt to the evolving operation states. Experimental results on the AVC benchmark with different PDN sizes demonstrate that the proposed TPA surpasses the state-of-the-art counterparts not only in terms of control performance but also by offering model transferability.

However, existing methods still struggle with limited and unevenly distributed annotated data. Therefore, inspired by the abundant global knowledge stored within pre-trained language models (PLMs), we propose a multi-task prompt learning framework for TRE (TemPrompt), incorporating prompt tuning and contrastive learning to tackle these issues. To elicit more effective prompts for PLMs, we introduce a task-oriented prompt construction approach that thoroughly takes the myriad factors of TRE into consideration for automatic prompt generation. In addition, we present temporal event reasoning as a supplement to bolster the model's focus on events and temporal cues. The experimental results demonstrate that TemPrompt outperforms all compared baselines across the majority of metrics under both standard and few-shot settings. A case study is provided to validate its effectiveness in crowdsourcing scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Multi-class Temporal Logic Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12397v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time-series data can represent the behaviors of autonomous systems, such as drones and self-driving cars. The task of binary and multi-class classification for time-series data has become a prominent area of research. Neural networks represent a popular approach to classifying data; However, they lack interpretability, which poses a significant challenge in extracting meaningful information from them. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is a formalism that describes the properties of timed behaviors. We propose a method that combines all of the above: neural networks that represent STL specifications for multi-class classification of time-series data. We offer two key contributions: 1) We introduce a notion of margin for multi-class classification, and 2) we introduce STL-based attributes for enhancing the interpretability of the results. We evaluate our method on two datasets and compare it with state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian temporal biclustering with applications to multi-subject neuroscience studies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17131v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of analyzing multivariate time series collected on multiple subjects, with the goal of identifying groups of subjects exhibiting similar trends in their recorded measurements over time as well as time-varying groups of associated measurements. To this end, we propose a Bayesian model for temporal biclustering featuring nested partitions, where a time-invariant partition of subjects induces a time-varying partition of measurements. Our approach allows for data-driven determination of the number of subject and measurement clusters as well as estimation of the number and location of changepoints in measurement partitions. To efficiently perform model fitting and posterior estimation with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we derive a blocked update of measurements' cluster-assignment sequences. We illustrate the performance of our model in two applications to functional magnetic resonance imaging data and to an electroencephalogram dataset. The results indicate that the proposed model can combine information from potentially many subjects to discover a set of interpretable, dynamic patterns. Experiments on simulated data compare the estimation performance of the proposed model against ground-truth values and other statistical methods, showing that it performs well at identifying ground-truth subject and measurement clusters even when no subject or time dependence is present.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Temporal Distances: Contrastive Successor Features Can Provide a Metric Structure for Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17098v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal distances lie at the heart of many algorithms for planning, control, and reinforcement learning that involve reaching goals, allowing one to estimate the transit time between two states. However, prior attempts to define such temporal distances in stochastic settings have been stymied by an important limitation: these prior approaches do not satisfy the triangle inequality. This is not merely a definitional concern, but translates to an inability to generalize and find shortest paths. In this paper, we build on prior work in contrastive learning and quasimetrics to show how successor features learned by contrastive learning (after a change of variables) form a temporal distance that does satisfy the triangle inequality, even in stochastic settings. Importantly, this temporal distance is computationally efficient to estimate, even in high-dimensional and stochastic settings. Experiments in controlled settings and benchmark suites demonstrate that an RL algorithm based on these new temporal distances exhibits combinatorial generalization (i.e., "stitching") and can sometimes learn more quickly than prior methods, including those based on quasimetrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |
| **[CausalFormer: An Interpretable Transformer for Temporal Causal Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16708v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal causal discovery is a crucial task aimed at uncovering the causal relations within time series data. The latest temporal causal discovery methods usually train deep learning models on prediction tasks to uncover the causality between time series. They capture causal relations by analyzing the parameters of some components of the trained models, e.g., attention weights and convolution weights. However, this is an incomplete mapping process from the model parameters to the causality and fails to investigate the other components, e.g., fully connected layers and activation functions, that are also significant for causal discovery. To facilitate the utilization of the whole deep learning models in temporal causal discovery, we proposed an interpretable transformer-based causal discovery model termed CausalFormer, which consists of the causality-aware transformer and the decomposition-based causality detector. The causality-aware transformer learns the causal representation of time series data using a prediction task with the designed multi-kernel causal convolution which aggregates each input time series along the temporal dimension under the temporal priority constraint. Then, the decomposition-based causality detector interprets the global structure of the trained causality-aware transformer with the proposed regression relevance propagation to identify potential causal relations and finally construct the causal graph. Experiments on synthetic, simulated, and real datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of CausalFormer on discovering temporal causality. Our code is available at https://github.com/lingbai-kong/CausalFormer.</p></details> |  |

This study analyses whether historical knowledge, which includes viral mutations detected in all genotypic tests before therapy, their temporal occurrence, and concomitant viral load measurements, can bring improvements. We introduce a method to weigh mutations, considering the previously enumerated factors and the reference mutation-drug Stanford resistance tables. We compare a model encompassing history (H) with one not using it (NH). Results: The H-model demonstrates superior discriminative ability, with a higher ROC-AUC score (76.34%) than the NH-model (74.98%). Significant Wilcoxon test results confirm that incorporating historical information improves consistently predictive accuracy for treatment outcomes. The better performance of the H-model might be attributed to its consideration of latent HIV reservoirs, probably obtained when leveraging historical information. The findings emphasize the importance of temporal dynamics in mutations, offering insights into HIV infection complexities. However, our result also shows that prediction accuracy remains relatively high even when no historical information is available. Supplementary information: Supplementary material is available.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Inference of Sequential Patterns for Neural Message Passing in Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16552v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The modelling of temporal patterns in dynamic graphs is an important current research issue in the development of time-aware GNNs. Whether or not a specific sequence of events in a temporal graph constitutes a temporal pattern not only depends on the frequency of its occurrence. We consider whether it deviates from what is expected in a temporal graph where timestamps are randomly shuffled. While accounting for such a random baseline is important to model temporal patterns, it has mostly been ignored by current temporal graph neural networks. To address this issue we propose HYPA-DBGNN, a novel two-step approach that combines (i) the inference of anomalous sequential patterns in time series data on graphs based on a statistically principled null model, with (ii) a neural message passing approach that utilizes a higher-order De Bruijn graph whose edges capture overrepresented sequential patterns. Our method leverages hypergeometric graph ensembles to identify anomalous edges within both first- and higher-order De Bruijn graphs, which encode the temporal ordering of events. The model introduces an inductive bias that enhances model interpretability. We evaluate our approach for static node classification using benchmark datasets and a synthetic dataset that showcases its ability to incorporate the observed inductive bias regarding over- and under-represented temporal edges. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in detecting similar patterns within empirical datasets, resulting in superior performance compared to baseline methods in node classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to introduce statistically informed GNNs that leverage temporal and causal sequence anomalies. HYPA-DBGNN represents a path for bridging the gap between statistical graph inference and neural graph representation learning, with potential applications to static GNNs.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniST: A Prompt-Empowered Universal Model for Urban Spatio-Temporal Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11838v4)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Urban spatio-temporal prediction is crucial for informed decision-making, such as traffic management, resource optimization, and emergence response. Despite remarkable breakthroughs in pretrained natural language models that enable one model to handle diverse tasks, a universal solution for spatio-temporal prediction remains challenging Existing prediction approaches are typically tailored for specific spatio-temporal scenarios, requiring task-specific model designs and extensive domain-specific training data. In this study, we introduce UniST, a universal model designed for general urban spatio-temporal prediction across a wide range of scenarios. Inspired by large language models, UniST achieves success through: (i) utilizing diverse spatio-temporal data from different scenarios, (ii) effective pre-training to capture complex spatio-temporal dynamics, (iii) knowledge-guided prompts to enhance generalization capabilities. These designs together unlock the potential of building a universal model for various scenarios Extensive experiments on more than 20 spatio-temporal scenarios demonstrate UniST's efficacy in advancing state-of-the-art performance, especially in few-shot and zero-shot prediction. The datasets and code implementation are released on https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/UniST.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes to resolve the above issues from a spatial-temporal modeling perspective. First, we propose a novel Temporally-smooth Procrustean Alignment module that estimates 3D deforming shapes and adjusts the camera motion by aligning the 3D shape sequence consecutively. Our new alignment module remedies the requirement of complex reference 3D shape during alignment, which is more conductive to non-isotropic deformation modeling. Second, we propose a spatial-weighted approach to enforce the low-rank constraint adaptively at different locations to accommodate drastic spatially-variant deformation reconstruction better. Our modeling outperform existing low-rank based methods, and extensive experiments across different datasets validate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024; V2 adds new experiments</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Scale Temporal Difference Transformer for Video-Text Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16111v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, in the field of video-text retrieval, there are many transformer-based methods. Most of them usually stack frame features and regrade frames as tokens, then use transformers for video temporal modeling. However, they commonly neglect the inferior ability of the transformer modeling local temporal information. To tackle this problem, we propose a transformer variant named Multi-Scale Temporal Difference Transformer (MSTDT). MSTDT mainly addresses the defects of the traditional transformer which has limited ability to capture local temporal information. Besides, in order to better model the detailed dynamic information, we make use of the difference feature between frames, which practically reflects the dynamic movement of a video. We extract the inter-frame difference feature and integrate the difference and frame feature by the multi-scale temporal transformer. In general, our proposed MSTDT consists of a short-term multi-scale temporal difference transformer and a long-term temporal transformer. The former focuses on modeling local temporal information, the latter aims at modeling global temporal information. At last, we propose a new loss to narrow the distance of similar samples. Extensive experiments show that backbone, such as CLIP, with MSTDT has attained a new state-of-the-art result.</p></details> |  |

Despite promising progress, existing methods still face challenges in capturing rich temporal context to establish long-term dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical model named SEDMamba, which incorporates the selective state space model (SSM) into surgical error detection, facilitating efficient long sequence modelling with linear complexity. SEDMamba enhances selective SSM with bottleneck mechanism and fine-to-coarse temporal fusion (FCTF) to detect and temporally localize surgical errors in long videos. The bottleneck mechanism compresses and restores features within their spatial dimension, thereby reducing computational complexity. FCTF utilizes multiple dilated 1D convolutional layers to merge temporal information across diverse scale ranges, accommodating errors of varying durations. Besides, we deploy an established observational clinical human reliability assessment tool (OCHRA) to annotate the errors of suturing tasks in an open-source radical prostatectomy dataset (SAR-RARP50), constructing the first frame-level in-vivo surgical error detection dataset to support error detection in real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our SEDMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods with at least 1.82% AUC and 3.80% AP performance gain with significantly reduced computational complexity.</p></details> | 8 pages |

A fundamental aspect of plans is the temporal order in which their steps needs to be executed, which reflects the underlying causal dependencies between them. We introduce CaT-Bench, a benchmark of Step Order Prediction questions, which test whether a step must necessarily occur before or after another in cooking recipe plans. We use this to evaluate how well frontier LLMs understand causal and temporal dependencies. We find that SOTA LLMs are underwhelming (best zero-shot is only 0.59 in F1), and are biased towards predicting dependence more often, perhaps relying on temporal order of steps as a heuristic. While prompting for explanations and using few-shot examples improve performance, the best F1 result is only 0.73. Further, human evaluation of explanations along with answer correctness show that, on average, humans do not agree with model reasoning. Surprisingly, we also find that explaining after answering leads to better performance than normal chain-of-thought prompting, and LLM answers are not consistent across questions about the same step pairs. Overall, results show that LLMs' ability to detect dependence between steps has significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified and Dynamic Graph for Temporal Character Grouping in Long Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14105v3)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video temporal character grouping locates appearing moments of major characters within a video according to their identities. To this end, recent works have evolved from unsupervised clustering to graph-based supervised clustering. However, graph methods are built upon the premise of fixed affinity graphs, bringing many inexact connections. Besides, they extract multi-modal features with kinds of models, which are unfriendly to deployment. In this paper, we present a unified and dynamic graph (UniDG) framework for temporal character grouping. This is accomplished firstly by a unified representation network that learns representations of multiple modalities within the same space and still preserves the modality's uniqueness simultaneously. Secondly, we present a dynamic graph clustering where the neighbors of different quantities are dynamically constructed for each node via a cyclic matching strategy, leading to a more reliable affinity graph. Thirdly, a progressive association method is introduced to exploit spatial and temporal contexts among different modalities, allowing multi-modal clustering results to be well fused. As current datasets only provide pre-extracted features, we evaluate our UniDG method on a collected dataset named MTCG, which contains each character's appearing clips of face and body and speaking voice tracks. We also evaluate our key components on existing clustering and retrieval datasets to verify the generalization ability. Experimental results manifest that our method can achieve promising results and outperform several state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Temporal Supervised Learning for Universal Remote Sensing Change Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15694v1)** | 2024-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bitemporal supervised learning paradigm always dominates remote sensing change detection using numerous labeled bitemporal image pairs, especially for high spatial resolution (HSR) remote sensing imagery. However, it is very expensive and labor-intensive to label change regions in large-scale bitemporal HSR remote sensing image pairs. In this paper, we propose single-temporal supervised learning (STAR) for universal remote sensing change detection from a new perspective of exploiting changes between unpaired images as supervisory signals. STAR enables us to train a high-accuracy change detector only using unpaired labeled images and can generalize to real-world bitemporal image pairs. To demonstrate the flexibility and scalability of STAR, we design a simple yet unified change detector, termed ChangeStar2, capable of addressing binary change detection, object change detection, and semantic change detection in one architecture. ChangeStar2 achieves state-of-the-art performances on eight public remote sensing change detection datasets, covering above two supervised settings, multiple change types, multiple scenarios.

However, this flexibility poses significant challenges, as the model must recognize not only the action categories seen during training but also novel categories specified at inference. Unlike standard temporal action localization, where training and test categories are predetermined, OVTAL requires understanding contextual cues that reveal the semantics of novel categories. To address these challenges, we introduce OVFormer, a novel open-vocabulary framework extending ActionFormer with three key contributions. First, we employ task-specific prompts as input to a large language model to obtain rich class-specific descriptions for action categories. Second, we introduce a cross-attention mechanism to learn the alignment between class representations and frame-level video features, facilitating the multimodal guided features. Third, we propose a two-stage training strategy which includes training with a larger vocabulary dataset and finetuning to downstream data to generalize to novel categories. OVFormer extends existing TAL methods to open-vocabulary settings. Comprehensive evaluations on the THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-1.3 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and pretrained models will be publicly released.</p></details> |  |

While a few researchers focus on learning ice layer patterns from echogram images captured by airborne snow radar sensors via different convolutional neural networks, the noise in the echogram images proves to be a major obstacle. Instead, we focus on geometric deep learning based on graph neural networks to learn the spatio-temporal patterns from thickness information of shallow ice layers and make predictions for deep layers. In this paper, we propose a physics-informed hybrid graph neural network that combines the GraphSAGE framework for graph feature learning with the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure for learning temporal changes, and introduce measurements of physical ice properties from Model Atmospheric Regional (MAR) weather model as physical node features. We found that our proposed network can consistently outperform the current non-inductive or non-physical model in predicting deep ice layer thickness.</p></details> |  |

However, the dynamics of human-AI interaction in the collaborative writing process are not well understood, and thus it remains largely unknown how human learning can be effectively supported with such cutting-edge GAI technologies. In this study, we aim to bridge this gap by investigating how humans employ GAI in collaborative writing and examining the interplay between the patterns of GAI usage and human writing behaviors. Considering the potential varying degrees to which people rely on GAI usage, we proposed to use Dynamic Time Warping time-series clustering for the identification and analysis of common temporal patterns in AI usage during the human-AI collaborative writing processes. Additionally, we incorporated Epistemic Network Analysis to reveal the correlation between GAI usage and human writing behaviors that reflect cognitive processes (i.e., knowledge telling, knowledge transformation, and cognitive presence), aiming to offer insights for developing better approaches and tools to support human to learn effectively via such human-AI collaborative writing activities. Our findings reveal four major distinct temporal patterns in AI utilization and highlight significant correlations between these patterns and human writing behaviors. These findings have significant implications for effectively supporting human learning with GAI in educational writing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper aims at developing a recurrent version of stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) for problem solving, where we have no underlying assumption on the dynamic orders of the input variables. Given a collection of historical data, we first build an initial RSCN model in the light of a supervisory mechanism, followed by an online update of the output weights by using a projection algorithm. Some theoretical results are established, including the echo state property, the universal approximation property of RSCNs for both the offline and online learnings, and the convergence of the output weights. The proposed RSCN model is remarkably distinguished from the well-known echo state networks (ESNs) in terms of the way of assigning the input random weight matrix and a special structure of the random feedback matrix. A comprehensive comparison study among the long short-term memory (LSTM) network, the original ESN, and several state-of-the-art ESN methods such as the simple cycle reservoir (SCR), the polynomial ESN (PESN), the leaky-integrator ESN (LIESN) and RSCN is carried out. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed RSCN performs favourably over all of the datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Population Activity Recovery: Milestones Unfolding, Temporal Interdependencies, and Relationship with Physical and Social Vulnerability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14720v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding sequential community recovery milestones is crucial for proactive recovery planning and monitoring. This study investigates these milestones related to population activities to examine their temporal interdependencies and evaluate the relationship between recovery milestones and physical (residential property damage) and social vulnerability (household income). This study leverages post-2017 Hurricane Harvey mobility data from Harris County to specify and analyze temporal recovery milestones and their interdependencies. The analysis examined four key milestones: return to evacuated areas, recovery of essential and nonessential services, and the rate of home-switch (moving out of residences). Robust linear regression validates interdependencies between across milestone lags and sequences: achieving earlier milestones accelerates subsequent recovery milestones. The study thus identifies six primary recovery milestone sequences. We found that social vulnerability accounted through the median household income level, rather than physical vulnerability to flooding accounted through the property damage extent, correlates with recovery delays between milestones. We studied variations in recovery sequences across lower and upper quantiles of property damage extent and median household income: lower property damage extent and lower household income show greater representation in the (slowest to recover) sequence, while households with greater damage and higher income are predominant in the group with the (fastest recovery sequences). Milestone sequence variability aligns closely with social vulnerability, independent of physical vulnerability. Understanding the variation in recovery sequences, milestone interdependencies, and social vulnerability disparities provides crucial evidence for targeted interventions.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |

Time series classification, the task of categorizing sequential data, has gained prominence, with machine learning approaches demonstrating remarkable performance on public benchmark datasets. However, progress has primarily been in designing architectures for learning representations from raw data at fixed (or ideal) time scales, which can fail to generalize to longer sequences. This work introduces a \textit{compositional representation learning} approach trained on statistically coherent components extracted from sequential data. Based on a multi-scale change space, an unsupervised approach is proposed to segment the sequential data into chunks with similar statistical properties. A sequence-based encoder model is trained in a multi-task setting to learn compositional representations from these temporal components for time series classification. We demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on publicly available time series classification benchmarks. Evaluating the coherence of segmented components shows its competitive performance on the unsupervised segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Previous works focus on solving specific tasks, primarily on time-sensitive question answering. While these methods have proven effective, they cannot generalize to a wider spectrum of temporal reasoning tasks. Therefore, we propose a crucial question: Can we build a universal framework to handle a variety of temporal reasoning tasks? To that end, we systematically study 38 temporal reasoning tasks. Based on the observation that 19 tasks are directly related to mathematics, we first leverage the available mathematical dataset to set a solid foundation for temporal reasoning. However, the in-depth study indicates that focusing solely on mathematical enhancement falls short of addressing pure temporal reasoning tasks. To mitigate this limitation, we propose a simple but effective self-critic temporal optimization method to enhance the model's temporal reasoning capabilities without sacrificing general task abilities. Finally, we develop Timo, a model designed to excel in temporal reasoning at the 7B and 13B scales. Notably, Timo outperforms the counterpart LLMs by 10.0 and 7.6 in average accuracy scores and achieves the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of comparable size. Extensive experiments further validate our framework's effectiveness and its generalization across diverse temporal tasks.

Recently, the evolving dynamics of knowledge have attracted a growing interest in Temporal Knowledge Graph Question Answering (TKGQA), an emerging task to answer temporal questions. However, this field grapples with ambiguities in defining temporal questions and lacks a systematic categorization of existing methods for TKGQA. In response, this paper provides a thorough survey from two perspectives: the taxonomy of temporal questions and the methodological categorization for TKGQA. Specifically, we first establish a detailed taxonomy of temporal questions engaged in prior studies. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive review of TKGQA techniques of two categories: semantic parsing-based and TKG embedding-based. Building on this review, the paper outlines potential research directions aimed at advancing the field of TKGQA. This work aims to serve as a comprehensive reference for TKGQA and to stimulate further research.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

OFOS platforms offer dynamic allocation incentives to users and merchants through diverse marketing campaigns to encourage payments while maintaining the platforms' budget efficiency. Despite significant progress, the marketing domain continues to face two primary challenges: (i) how to allocate a limited budget with greater efficiency, demanding precision in predicting users' monotonic response (i.e. sensitivity) to incentives, and (ii) ensuring spatio-temporal adaptability and robustness in diverse marketing campaigns across different times and locations. To address these issues, we propose a Constrained Monotonic Adaptive Network (CoMAN) method for spatio-temporal perception within marketing pricing. Specifically, we capture spatio-temporal preferences within attribute features through two foundational spatio-temporal perception modules. To further enhance catching the user sensitivity differentials to incentives across varied times and locations, we design modules for learning spatio-temporal convexity and concavity as well as for expressing sensitivity functions. CoMAN can achieve a more efficient allocation of incentive investments during pricing, thus increasing the conversion rate and orders while maintaining budget efficiency. Extensive offline and online experimental results within our diverse marketing campaigns demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach while outperforming the monotonic state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 7 pages |

In this work, we utilize kinetics-informed neural networks (KINNs), which are artificial feedforward neural networks designed to solve ordinary differential equations constrained by micro-kinetic models, to model the TAP data. We demonstrate that, under the assumption that all concentrations are known in the thin catalyst zone, KINNs can simultaneously fit the transient data, retrieve the kinetic model parameters, and interpolate unseen pulse behavior for multi-pulse experiments. We further demonstrate that, by modifying the loss function, KINNs maintain these capabilities even when precise thin-zone information is unavailable, as would be the case with real experimental TAP data. We also compare the approach to existing optimization techniques, which reveals improved noise tolerance and performance in extracting kinetic parameters. The KINNs approach offers an efficient alternative for TAP analysis and can assist in interpreting transient kinetics in complex systems over long timescales.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages main, 13 pages SI, 16 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Matrix factorization is employed to decompose spatio-temporal data into spatial and temporal components. To improve clarity in the temporal patterns, we introduce a nonnegativity constraint on the time domain along with regularization in the frequency domain. Specifically, regularization in the frequency domain involves selecting features in the frequency space, making an interpretation in the frequency domain more convenient. We propose two methods in the frequency domain: soft and hard regularizations, and provide convergence guarantees to first-order stationary points of the corresponding constrained optimization problem. While our primary motivation stems from geophysical data analysis based on GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data, our methodology has the potential for wider application. Consequently, when applying our methodology to GRACE data, we find that the results with the proposed methodology are comparable to previous research in the field of geophysical sciences but offer clearer interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, Final version</p></details> |
| **[Temporal label recovery from noisy dynamical data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13635v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analyzing dynamical data often requires information of the temporal labels, but such information is unavailable in many applications. Recovery of these temporal labels, closely related to the seriation or sequencing problem, becomes crucial in the study. However, challenges arise due to the nonlinear nature of the data and the complexity of the underlying dynamical system, which may be periodic or non-periodic. Additionally, noise within the feature space complicates the theoretical analysis. Our work develops spectral algorithms that leverage manifold learning concepts to recover temporal labels from noisy data. We first construct the graph Laplacian of the data, and then employ the second (and the third) Fiedler vectors to recover temporal labels. This method can be applied to both periodic and aperiodic cases. It also does not require monotone properties on the similarity matrix, which are commonly assumed in existing spectral seriation algorithms. We develop the $\ell_{\infty}$ error of our estimators for the temporal labels and ranking, without assumptions on the eigen-gap. In numerical analysis, our method outperforms spectral seriation algorithms based on a similarity matrix. The performance of our algorithms is further demonstrated on a synthetic biomolecule data example.</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

Given that MLMs are continuously trained with increasing amounts of additional data collected over time, an important yet unanswered question is how the social biases encoded with MLMs vary over time. In particular, the number of social media users continues to grow at an exponential rate, and it is a valid concern for the MLMs trained specifically on social media data whether their social biases (if any) would also amplify over time. To empirically analyse this problem, we use a series of MLMs pretrained on chronologically ordered temporal snapshots of corpora. Our analysis reveals that, although social biases are present in all MLMs, most types of social bias remain relatively stable over time (with a few exceptions). To further understand the mechanisms that influence social biases in MLMs, we analyse the temporal corpora used to train the MLMs. Our findings show that some demographic groups, such as male, obtain higher preference over the other, such as female on the training corpora constantly.</p></details> |  |

Despite their advantages, a significant gap persists between real-world scenarios, where detection speed is critical, and existing proposals, which operate on large graphs representing several hours of traffic. This gap results in unrealistic operational conditions and impractical detection delays. Moreover, existing models do not generalize well across different networks, hampering their deployment in production environments. To address these issues, we introduce PPTGNN, a practical spatio-temporal GNN for intrusion detection. PPTGNN enables near real-time predictions, while better capturing the spatio-temporal dynamics of network attacks. PPTGNN employs self-supervised pre-training for improved performance and reduced dependency on labeled data. We evaluate PPTGNN on three public datasets and show that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models, such as E-ResGAT and E-GraphSAGE, with an average accuracy improvement of 10.38%. Finally, we show that a pre-trained PPTGNN can easily be fine-tuned to unseen networks with minimal labeled examples. This highlights the potential of PPTGNN as a general, large-scale pre-trained model that can effectively operate in diverse network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper currently under review.

| **[Multi-scale Restoration of Missing Data in Optical Time-series Images with Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13358v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to factors such as thick cloud cover and sensor limitations, remote sensing images often suffer from significant missing data, resulting in incomplete time-series information. Existing methods for imputing missing values in remote sensing images do not fully exploit spatio-temporal auxiliary information, leading to limited accuracy in restoration. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based approach called MS2TAN (Multi-scale Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention Network), for reconstructing time-series remote sensing images. Firstly, we introduce an efficient spatio-temporal feature extractor based on Masked Spatial-Temporal Attention (MSTA), to obtain high-quality representations of the spatio-temporal neighborhood features in the missing regions. Secondly, a Multi-scale Restoration Network consisting of the MSTA-based Feature Extractors, is employed to progressively refine the missing values by exploring spatio-temporal neighborhood features at different scales. Thirdly, we propose a ``Pixel-Structure-Perception'' Multi-Objective Joint Optimization method to enhance the visual effects of the reconstruction results from multiple perspectives and preserve more texture structures. Furthermore, the proposed method reconstructs missing values in all input temporal phases in parallel (i.e., Multi-In Multi-Out), achieving higher processing efficiency. Finally, experimental evaluations on two typical missing data restoration tasks across multiple research areas demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with an improvement of 0.40dB/1.17dB in mean peak signal-to-noise ratio (mPSNR) and 3.77/9.41 thousandths in mean structural similarity (mSSIM), while exhibiting stronger texture and structural consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Explainable Temporal Graph Networks based on Graph Information Bottleneck](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13214v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNN) have the ability to capture both the graph topology and dynamic dependencies of interactions within a graph over time. There has been a growing need to explain the predictions of TGNN models due to the difficulty in identifying how past events influence their predictions. Since the explanation model for a static graph cannot be readily applied to temporal graphs due to its inability to capture temporal dependencies, recent studies proposed explanation models for temporal graphs. However, existing explanation models for temporal graphs rely on post-hoc explanations, requiring separate models for prediction and explanation, which is limited in two aspects: efficiency and accuracy of explanation. In this work, we propose a novel built-in explanation framework for temporal graphs, called Self-Explainable Temporal Graph Networks based on Graph Information Bottleneck (TGIB). TGIB provides explanations for event occurrences by introducing stochasticity in each temporal event based on the Information Bottleneck theory. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of TGIB in terms of both the link prediction performance and explainability compared to state-of-the-art methods. This is the first work that simultaneously performs prediction and explanation for temporal graphs in an end-to-end manner.</p></details> | KDD 2024 |
| **[EEG-DBNet: A Dual-Branch Network for Temporal-Spectral Decoding in Motor-Imagery Brain-Computer Interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16090v3)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motor imagery electroencephalogram (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer significant advantages for individuals with restricted limb mobility. However, challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio and limited spatial resolution impede accurate feature extraction from EEG signals, thereby affecting the classification accuracy of different actions. To address these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end dual-branch network (EEG-DBNet) that decodes the temporal and spectral sequences of EEG signals in parallel through two distinct network branches. Each branch comprises a local convolutional block and a global convolutional block. The local convolutional block transforms the source signal from the temporal-spatial domain to the temporal-spectral domain. By varying the number of filters and convolution kernel sizes, the local convolutional blocks in different branches adjust the length of their respective dimension sequences. Different types of pooling layers are then employed to emphasize the features of various dimension sequences, setting the stage for subsequent global feature extraction. The global convolution block splits and reconstructs the feature of the signal sequence processed by the local convolution block in the same branch and further extracts features through the dilated causal convolutional neural networks. Finally, the outputs from the two branches are concatenated, and signal classification is completed via a fully connected layer. Our proposed method achieves classification accuracies of 85.84% and 91.60% on the BCI Competition 4-2a and BCI Competition 4-2b datasets, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art models.

| **[Traffic Prediction considering Multiple Levels of Spatial-temporal Information: A Multi-scale Graph Wavelet-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13038v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although traffic prediction has been receiving considerable attention with a number of successes in the context of intelligent transportation systems, the prediction of traffic states over a complex transportation network that contains different road types has remained a challenge. This study proposes a multi-scale graph wavelet temporal convolution network (MSGWTCN) to predict the traffic states in complex transportation networks. Specifically, a multi-scale spatial block is designed to simultaneously capture the spatial information at different levels, and the gated temporal convolution network is employed to extract the temporal dependencies of the data. The model jointly learns to mount multiple levels of the spatial interactions by stacking graph wavelets with different scales. Two real-world datasets are used in this study to investigate the model performance, including a highway network in Seattle and a dense road network of Manhattan in New York City. Experiment results show that the proposed model outperforms other baseline models. Furthermore, different scales of graph wavelets are found to be effective in extracting local, intermediate and global information at the same time and thus enable the model to learn a complex transportation network topology with various types of road segments. By carefully customizing the scales of wavelets, the model is able to improve the prediction performance and better adapt to different network configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Temporal Prediction of Continuous Disease Trajectories and Treatment Effects Using Neural SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12807v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized medicine based on medical images, including predicting future individualized clinical disease progression and treatment response, would have an enormous impact on healthcare and drug development, particularly for diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS)) with long term, complex, heterogeneous evolutions and no cure. In this work, we present the first stochastic causal temporal framework to model the continuous temporal evolution of disease progression via Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE). The proposed causal inference model takes as input the patient's high dimensional images (MRI) and tabular data, and predicts both factual and counterfactual progression trajectories on different treatments in latent space. The NSDE permits the estimation of high-confidence personalized trajectories and treatment effects. Extensive experiments were performed on a large, multi-centre, proprietary dataset of patient 3D MRI and clinical data acquired during several randomized clinical trials for MS treatments. Our results present the first successful uncertainty-based causal Deep Learning (DL) model to: (a) accurately predict future patient MS disability evolution (e.g. EDSS) and treatment effects leveraging baseline MRI, and (b) permit the discovery of subgroups of patients for which the model has high confidence in their response to treatment even in clinical trials which did not reach their clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> |  |

Accurate real-time traffic prediction is essential to improve the safety, stability, and versatility of smart city systems, i.e., traffic control and optimal routing. The complex and highly dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies make effective predictions still face many challenges. Recent studies have shown that spatial-temporal graph neural networks exhibit great potential applied to traffic prediction, which combines sequential models with graph convolutional networks to jointly model temporal and spatial correlations. However, a survey study of graph learning, spatial-temporal graph models for traffic, as well as a fair comparison of baseline models are pending and unavoidable issues. In this paper, we first provide a systematic review of graph learning strategies and commonly used graph convolution algorithms. Then we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of recently proposed spatial-temporal graph network models. Furthermore, we build a study called STG4Traffic using the deep learning framework PyTorch to establish a standardized and scalable benchmark on two types of traffic datasets. We can evaluate their performance by personalizing the model settings with uniform metrics. Finally, we point out some problems in the current study and discuss future directions.

Premature predictions may yield a higher rate of false alarms, whereas delaying predictions to gather more information can render them too late to be useful. In applications such as wildfires, crimes, and traffic jams, timely forecasting are vital for safeguarding human life and property. Consequently, finding a balance between accuracy and timeliness is crucial. In this paper, we propose an early spatio-temporal forecasting model based on Multi-Objective reinforcement learning that can either implement an optimal policy given a preference or infer the preference based on a small number of samples. The model addresses two primary challenges: 1) enhancing the accuracy of early forecasting and 2) providing the optimal policy for determining the most suitable prediction time for each area. Our method demonstrates superior performance on three large-scale real-world datasets, surpassing existing methods in early spatio-temporal forecasting tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper in KDD 2024</p></details> |

Such applications help assess patients' outcomes and analyze how diseases progress at the individual level. However, existing methods for this task present some limitations. Some approaches attempt to model the distribution of MRI scans directly by conditioning the model on patients' ages, but they fail to explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes in the brain and time intervals, especially on age-unbalanced datasets. Other approaches simply rely on interpolation between scans, which limits their clinical application as they do not predict future MRIs. To address these challenges, we propose a Temporally-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM), which introduces a novel approach to accurately infer progression in brain MRIs. TADM learns the distribution of structural changes in terms of intensity differences between scans and combines the prediction of these changes with the initial baseline scans to generate future MRIs. Furthermore, during training, we propose to leverage a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) to refine the model's training process, enhancing its ability to produce accurate MRIs that match the expected age gap between baseline and generated scans. Our assessment, conducted on the OASIS-3 dataset, uses similarity metrics and region sizes computed by comparing predicted and real follow-up scans on 3 relevant brain regions. TADM achieves large improvements over existing approaches, with an average decrease of 24% in region size error and an improvement of 4% in similarity metrics. These evaluations demonstrate the improvement of our model in mimicking temporal brain neurodegenerative progression compared to existing methods. Our approach will benefit applications, such as predicting patient outcomes or improving treatments for patients.</p></details> |  |

The existing video editing methods usually apply the typical 2D DDIM inversion or naive spatial-temporal DDIM inversion before editing, which leverages time-varying representation for each frame to derive noisy latent. Unlike most existing approaches, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Expectation-Maximization (STEM) inversion, which formulates the dense video feature under an expectation-maximization manner and iteratively estimates a more compact basis set to represent the whole video. Each frame applies the fixed and global representation for inversion, which is more friendly for temporal consistency during reconstruction and editing. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our STEM inversion can achieve consistent improvement on two state-of-the-art video editing methods.

Recently, the increasing demand for temporal facts in downstream tasks has led to the emergence of the task of temporal fact extraction. In this paper, we specifically address the extraction of temporal facts from natural language text. Previous studies fail to handle the challenge of establishing time-to-fact correspondences in complex sentences. To overcome this hurdle, we propose a timeline-based sentence decomposition strategy using large language models (LLMs) with in-context learning, ensuring a fine-grained understanding of the timeline associated with various facts. In addition, we evaluate the performance of LLMs for direct temporal fact extraction and get unsatisfactory results. To this end, we introduce TSDRE, a method that incorporates the decomposition capabilities of LLMs into the traditional fine-tuning of smaller pre-trained language models (PLMs). To support the evaluation, we construct ComplexTRED, a complex temporal fact extraction dataset. Our experiments show that TSDRE achieves state-of-the-art results on both HyperRED-Temporal and ComplexTRED datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL2024 main conference</p></details> |

Although existing traffic prediction models often emphasize developing complex neural network structures, their accuracy has not improved. Recently, large language models have shown outstanding capabilities in time series analysis. Differing from existing models, LLMs progress mainly through parameter expansion and extensive pretraining while maintaining their fundamental structures. Motivated by these developments, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Large Language Model (ST-LLM) for traffic prediction. In the ST-LLM, we define timesteps at each location as tokens and design a spatial-temporal embedding to learn the spatial location and global temporal patterns of these tokens. Additionally, we integrate these embeddings by a fusion convolution to each token for a unified spatial-temporal representation. Furthermore, we innovate a partially frozen attention strategy to adapt the LLM to capture global spatial-temporal dependencies for traffic prediction. Comprehensive experiments on real traffic datasets offer evidence that ST-LLM is a powerful spatial-temporal learner that outperforms state-of-the-art models. Notably, the ST-LLM also exhibits robust performance in both few-shot and zero-shot prediction scenarios.

However, existing methods lack the incorporation of temporal information. To reach the full potential of gait recognition, we advocate for the consideration of temporal features at varying granularities and spans. This paper introduces a novel framework, GaitGS, which aggregates temporal features simultaneously in both granularity and span dimensions. Specifically, the Multi-Granularity Feature Extractor (MGFE) is designed to capture micro-motion and macro-motion information at fine and coarse levels respectively, while the Multi-Span Feature Extractor (MSFE) generates local and global temporal representations. Through extensive experiments on two datasets, our method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, achieving Rank-1 accuracy of 98.2%, 96.5%, and 89.7% on CASIA-B under different conditions, and 97.6% on OU-MVLP.

The recency heuristic is one of the key assumptions made by TD($\lambda$), which reinforces recent experiences according to an exponentially decaying weighting. In fact, all other widely used return estimators for TD learning, such as $n$-step returns, satisfy a weaker (i.e., non-monotonic) recency heuristic. Why is the recency heuristic effective for temporal credit assignment? What happens when credit is assigned in a way that violates this heuristic? In this paper, we analyze the specific mathematical implications of adopting the recency heuristic in TD learning. We prove that any return estimator satisfying this heuristic: 1) is guaranteed to converge to the correct value function, 2) has a relatively fast contraction rate, and 3) has a long window of effective credit assignment, yet bounded worst-case variance. We also give a counterexample where on-policy, tabular TD methods violating the recency heuristic diverge. Our results offer some of the first theoretical evidence that credit assignment based on the recency heuristic facilitates learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>RLC 2...</summary><p>RLC 2024. 18 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, these tasks are usually solved separately without ensuring coherence, which is crucial for aligning downstream decisions. Previous works mainly focus on ensuring coherence with some straightforward methods, e.g., aggregation from the forecasts of fine granularity to the coarse ones, and allocation from the coarse granularity to the fine ones. These methods merely take the temporal hierarchical structure to maintain coherence without improving the forecasting accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel granularity message-passing mechanism (GMP) that leverages temporal hierarchy information to improve forecasting performance and also utilizes an adaptive reconciliation (AR) strategy to maintain coherence without performance loss. Furthermore, we introduce an optimization module to achieve task-based targets while adhering to more real-world constraints. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our framework (GMP-AR) achieves superior performances on temporal hierarchical forecasting tasks compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our framework has been successfully applied to a real-world task of payment traffic management in Alipay by integrating with the task-based optimization module.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformance Checking of Fuzzy Logs against Declarative Temporal Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12078v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional conformance checking tasks assume that event data provide a faithful and complete representation of the actual process executions. This assumption has been recently questioned: more and more often events are not traced explicitly, but are instead indirectly obtained as the result of event recognition pipelines, and thus inherently come with uncertainty. In this work, differently from the typical probabilistic interpretation of uncertainty, we consider the relevant case where uncertainty refers to which activity is actually conducted, under a fuzzy semantics. In this novel setting, we consider the problem of checking whether fuzzy event data conform with declarative temporal rules specified as Declare patterns or, more generally, as formulae of linear temporal logic over finite traces (LTLf). This requires to relax the assumption that at each instant only one activity is executed, and to correspondingly redefine boolean operators of the logic with a fuzzy semantics. Specifically, we provide a threefold contribution. First, we define a fuzzy counterpart of LTLf tailored to our purpose. Second, we cast conformance checking over fuzzy logs as a verification problem in this logic. Third, we provide a proof-of-concept, efficient implementation based on the PyTorch Python library, suited to check conformance of multiple fuzzy traces at once.</p></details> |  |

We employ two types of prompts and five LLMs (GPT-3.5, Mixtral, Llama 2, Gemma, and PMC-LLaMA) to obtain responses about the temporal relations between two events. Our experiments demonstrate that LLMs struggle in the zero-shot setting performing worse than fine-tuned specialized models in terms of F1 score, showing that this is a challenging task for LLMs. We further contribute a novel comprehensive temporal analysis by calculating consistency scores for each LLM. Our findings reveal that LLMs face challenges in providing responses consistent to the temporal properties of uniqueness and transitivity. Moreover, we study the relation between the temporal consistency of an LLM and its accuracy and whether the latter can be improved by solving temporal inconsistencies. Our analysis shows that even when temporal consistency is achieved, the predictions can remain inaccurate.</p></details> |  |

Depth completion aims at increasing the resolution of such a depth image by infilling and interpolating the sparse depth values. Like most existing approaches, we make use of camera images as guidance in very sparse or occluded regions. In addition, we propose a temporal algorithm that utilizes information from previous timesteps using recurrence. In this work, we show how a state-of-the-art method PENet can be modified to benefit from recurrency. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI depth completion dataset while adding only less than one percent of additional overhead in terms of both neural network parameters and floating point operations. The accuracy is especially improved for faraway objects and regions containing a low amount of lidar depth samples. Even in regions without any ground truth (like sky and rooftops) we observe large improvements which are not captured by the existing evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Traffic Prediction:Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11921v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic prediction is a challenging spatio-temporal forecasting problem that involves highly complex spatio-temporal correlations. This paper proposes a Multi-level Multi-view Augmented Spatio-temporal Transformer (LVSTformer) for traffic prediction. The model aims to capture spatial dependencies from three different levels: local geographic, global semantic, and pivotal nodes, along with long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Specifically, we design three spatial augmented views to delve into the spatial information from the perspectives of local, global, and pivotal nodes. By combining three spatial augmented views with three parallel spatial self-attention mechanisms, the model can comprehensively captures spatial dependencies at different levels. We design a gated temporal self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long- and short-term temporal dependencies. Furthermore, a spatio-temporal context broadcasting module is introduced between two spatio-temporal layers to ensure a well-distributed allocation of attention scores, alleviating overfitting and information loss, and enhancing the generalization ability and robustness of the model. A comprehensive set of experiments is conducted on six well-known traffic benchmarks, the experimental results demonstrate that LVSTformer achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to competing baselines, with the maximum improvement reaching up to 4.32%.</p></details> |  |

Although several recent methods have been proposed to model complex dynamics in STGs, addressing long-range spatio-temporal dependencies remains a significant challenge, leading to limited performance gains. Inspired by a recently proposed state space model named Mamba, which has shown remarkable capability of capturing long-range dependency, we propose a new STG forecasting framework named SpoT-Mamba. SpoT-Mamba generates node embeddings by scanning various node-specific walk sequences. Based on the node embeddings, it conducts temporal scans to capture long-range spatio-temporal dependencies. Experimental results on the real-world traffic forecasting dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of SpoT-Mamba.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables.

JASCO can generate high-quality music samples conditioned on global text descriptions along with fine-grained local controls. JASCO is based on the Flow Matching modeling paradigm together with a novel conditioning method. This allows music generation controlled both locally (e.g., chords) and globally (text description). Specifically, we apply information bottleneck layers in conjunction with temporal blurring to extract relevant information with respect to specific controls. This allows the incorporation of both symbolic and audio-based conditions in the same text-to-music model. We experiment with various symbolic control signals (e.g., chords, melody), as well as with audio representations (e.g., separated drum tracks, full-mix). We evaluate JASCO considering both generation quality and condition adherence, using both objective metrics and human studies. Results suggest that JASCO is comparable to the evaluated baselines considering generation quality while allowing significantly better and more versatile controls over the generated music. Samples are available on our demo page https://pages.cs.huji.ac.il/adiyoss-lab/JASCO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Scaling Law for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17785v2)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in a wide range of tasks, leading to increasing attention towards the research on how scaling LLMs affects their performance. Existing works, termed Scaling Laws, have discovered that the final test loss of LLMs scales as power-laws with model size, computational budget, and dataset size. However, the temporal change of the test loss of an LLM throughout its pre-training process remains unexplored, though it is valuable in many aspects, such as selecting better hyperparameters \textit{directly} on the target LLM. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of Temporal Scaling Law, studying how the test loss of an LLM evolves as the training steps scale up. In contrast to modeling the test loss as a whole in a coarse-grained manner, we break it down and dive into the fine-grained test loss of each token position, and further develop a dynamic hyperbolic-law. Afterwards, we derive the much more precise temporal scaling law by studying the temporal patterns of the parameters in the dynamic hyperbolic-law. Results on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) validation datasets demonstrate that our temporal scaling law accurately predicts the test loss of LLMs across training steps. Our temporal scaling law has broad practical applications. First, it enables direct and efficient hyperparameter selection on the target LLM, such as data mixture proportions. Secondly, viewing the LLM pre-training dynamics from the token position granularity provides some insights to enhance the understanding of LLM pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures; Under review</p></details> |

Despite various pre-training methods tailored to the characteristics of RS data, a key limitation persists: the inability to effectively integrate spatial, temporal, and spectral information within a single unified model. To unlock the potential of RS data, we construct a Spatial-Temporal-Spectral Structured Dataset (STSSD) characterized by the incorporation of multiple RS sources, diverse coverage, unified locations within image sets, and heterogeneity within images. Building upon this structured dataset, we propose an Anchor-Aware Masked AutoEncoder method (A$^{2}$-MAE), leveraging intrinsic complementary information from the different kinds of images and geo-information to reconstruct the masked patches during the pre-training phase. A$^{2}$-MAE integrates an anchor-aware masking strategy and a geographic encoding module to comprehensively exploit the properties of RS images. Specifically, the proposed anchor-aware masking strategy dynamically adapts the masking process based on the meta-information of a pre-selected anchor image, thereby facilitating the training on images captured by diverse types of RS sources within one model. Furthermore, we propose a geographic encoding method to leverage accurate spatial patterns, enhancing the model generalization capabilities for downstream applications that are generally location-related. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves comprehensive improvements across various downstream tasks compared with existing RS pre-training methods, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and change detection tasks.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach, GenMM, for jointly editing RGB videos and LiDAR scans by inserting temporally and geometrically consistent 3D objects. Our method uses a reference image and 3D bounding boxes to seamlessly insert and blend new objects into target videos. We inpaint the 2D Regions of Interest (consistent with 3D boxes) using a diffusion-based video inpainting model. We then compute semantic boundaries of the object and estimate it's surface depth using state-of-the-art semantic segmentation and monocular depth estimation techniques. Subsequently, we employ a geometry-based optimization algorithm to recover the 3D shape of the object's surface, ensuring it fits precisely within the 3D bounding box. Finally, LiDAR rays intersecting with the new object surface are updated to reflect consistent depths with its geometry. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenMM in inserting various 3D objects across video and LiDAR modalities.</p></details> |  |

Arm's latest processors include Correlating Miss Chaining prefetchers, which store such patterns in a partition of the on-chip cache. However, the state-of-the-art on-chip temporal prefetcher in the literature, Triage, features some design inconsistencies and inaccuracies that pose challenges for practical implementation. We first examine and design fixes for these inconsistencies to produce an implementable baseline. We then introduce Triangel, a prefetcher that extends Triage with novel sampling-based methodologies to allow it to be aggressive and timely when the prefetcher is able to handle observed long-term patterns, and to avoid inaccurate prefetches when less able to do so. Triangel gives a 26.4% speedup compared to a baseline system with a conventional stride prefetcher alone, compared with 9.3% for Triage at degree 1 and 14.2% at degree 4. At the same time Triangel only increases memory traffic by 10% relative to baseline, versus 28.5% for Triage.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published at ISCA 2024</p></details> |

Previously proposed Event-Independent Network V2 (EINV2) has achieved outstanding performance on SELD. However, it still faces challenges in effectively extracting features across spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. This paper proposes a three-stage network structure named Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module to fully extract multi-scale features across spectral, spatial, and temporal domains. The MFF module utilizes parallel subnetworks architecture to generate multi-scale spectral and spatial features. The TF-Convolution Module is employed to provide multi-scale temporal features. We incorporated MFF into EINV2 and term the proposed method as MFF-EINV2. Experimental results in 2022 and 2023 DCASE challenge task3 datasets show the effectiveness of our MFF-EINV2, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to published methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2024</p></details> |

Mental disorder prediction from social media posts by current LLMs is challenging due to the complexities of sequential text data and the limited context length of language models. Current language model-based approaches split a single data instance into multiple chunks to compensate for limited context size. The predictive model is then applied to each chunk individually, and the most voted output is selected as the final prediction. This results in the loss of inter-post dependencies and important time variant information, leading to poor performance. We propose a novel framework which first compresses the large sequence of chronologically ordered social media posts into a series of numbers. We then use this time variant representation for mental disorder classification. We demonstrate the generalization capabilities of our framework by outperforming the current SOTA in three different mental conditions: depression, self-harm, and anorexia, with an absolute improvement of 5% in the F1 score. We investigate the situation where current data instances fall within the context length of language models and present empirical results highlighting the importance of temporal properties of textual data. Furthermore, we utilize the proposed framework for a cross-domain study, exploring commonalities across disorders and the possibility of inter-domain data usage.</p></details> | <details><summary>RK an...</summary><p>RK and KM contributed equally to this work, 15 pages, 5 figures, 9 table</p></details> |

Consequently, various network generative models (called temporal network models) have been presented to model how the network topologies evolve dynamically over time. Temporal network models face the challenge of results evaluation because common evaluation methods are appropriate only for static networks. This paper proposes an automatic approach based on deep learning to handle this issue. In addition to an evaluation method, the proposed method can also be used for anomaly detection in evolving networks. The proposed method has been evaluated on five different datasets, and the evaluations show that it outperforms the alternative methods based on the error rate measure in different datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[Self-Supervised Representation Learning with Spatial-Temporal Consistency for Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10501v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been efforts to improve the performance in sign language recognition by designing self-supervised learning methods. However, these methods capture limited information from sign pose data in a frame-wise learning manner, leading to sub-optimal solutions. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective self-supervised contrastive learning framework to excavate rich context via spatial-temporal consistency from two distinct perspectives and learn instance discriminative representation for sign language recognition. On one hand, since the semantics of sign language are expressed by the cooperation of fine-grained hands and coarse-grained trunks, we utilize both granularity information and encode them into latent spaces. The consistency between hand and trunk features is constrained to encourage learning consistent representation of instance samples. On the other hand, inspired by the complementary property of motion and joint modalities, we first introduce first-order motion information into sign language modeling. Additionally, we further bridge the interaction between the embedding spaces of both modalities, facilitating bidirectional knowledge transfer to enhance sign language representation. Our method is evaluated with extensive experiments on four public benchmarks, and achieves new state-of-the-art performance with a notable margin.

These rules have numerous applications including safety validation using formal methods, constraining motion planning among autonomous agents, and classifying data. However, existing methods for learning temporal logic predicates from data provide no assurances about the correctness of the resulting predicate. We present a novel method to learn temporal logic predicates from data with finite-sample correctness guarantees. Our approach leverages expression optimization and conformal prediction to learn predicates that correctly describe future trajectories under mild assumptions with a user-defined confidence level. We provide experimental results showing the performance of our approach on a simulated trajectory dataset and perform ablation studies to understand how each component of our algorithm contributes to its performance.</p></details> |  |

Researchers have made great efforts on temporal HIN embedding in Euclidean spaces and got some considerable achievements. However, there is always a fundamental conflict that many real-world networks show hierarchical property and power-law distribution, and are not isometric of Euclidean spaces. Recently, representation learning in hyperbolic spaces has been proved to be valid for data with hierarchical and power-law structure. Inspired by this character, we propose a hyperbolic heterogeneous temporal network embedding ($\text{H}^2\text{TNE}$) model for temporal HINs. Specifically, we leverage a temporally and heterogeneously double-constrained random walk strategy to capture the structural and semantic information, and then calculate the embedding by exploiting hyperbolic distance in proximity measurement. Experimental results show that our method has superior performance on temporal link prediction and node classification compared with SOTA models.</p></details> |  |

They are observed through a colonoscopy screening procedure that generates a stream of video frames. Segmenting polyps in their natural video screening procedure has several challenges, such as the co-existence of imaging artefacts, motion blur, and floating debris. Most existing polyp segmentation algorithms are developed on curated still image datasets that do not represent real-world colonoscopy. Their performance often degrades on video data. We propose a video polyp segmentation method that performs self-supervised learning as an auxiliary task and a spatial-temporal self-attention mechanism for improved representation learning. Our end-to-end configuration and joint optimisation of losses enable the network to learn more discriminative contextual features in videos. Our experimental results demonstrate an improvement with respect to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Our ablation study also confirms that the choice of the proposed joint end-to-end training improves network accuracy by over 3% and nearly 10% on both the Dice similarity coefficient and intersection-over-union compared to the recently proposed method PNS+ and Polyp-PVT, respectively. Results on previously unseen video data indicate that the proposed method generalises.</p></details> | 12 pages |

In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-temporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical system's perspective.</p></details> | 9 pages, 12 figures |

These works can generate temporal node representations by encoding the surrounding neighborhoods for the target node. However, an inherent limitation of existing TGNs is their reliance on fixed, hand-crafted rules for neighborhood encoding, overlooking the necessity for an adaptive and learnable neighborhood that can accommodate both personalization and temporal evolution across different timestamps. In this paper, we aim to enhance existing TGNs by introducing an adaptive neighborhood encoding mechanism. We present SEAN, a flexible plug-and-play model that can be seamlessly integrated with existing TGNs, effectively boosting their performance. To achieve this, we decompose the adaptive neighborhood encoding process into two phases: (i) representative neighbor selection, and (ii) temporal-aware neighborhood information aggregation. Specifically, we propose the Representative Neighbor Selector component, which automatically pinpoints the most important neighbors for the target node. It offers a tailored understanding of each node's unique surrounding context, facilitating personalization. Subsequently, we propose a Temporal-aware Aggregator, which synthesizes neighborhood aggregation by selectively determining the utilization of aggregation routes and decaying the outdated information, allowing our model to adaptively leverage both the contextually significant and current information during aggregation. We conduct extensive experiments by integrating SEAN into three representative TGNs, evaluating their performance on four public datasets and one financial benchmark dataset introduced in this paper. The results demonstrate that SEAN consistently leads to performance improvements across all models, achieving SOTA performance and exceptional robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD'2...</summary><p>KDD'2024 Research Track Paper</p></details> |

By adopting a pre-determined star topology as a GWT prior to training, we balance edge reduction with efficient information propagation, reducing computational demands while maintaining high model performance. Both the time and memory computational complexity of generating adaptive spatial-temporal graphs is significantly reduced from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(N)$. Our approach streamlines the ASTGNN deployment by eliminating the need for exhaustive training, pruning, and retraining cycles, and demonstrates empirically across various datasets that it is possible to achieve comparable performance to full models with substantially lower computational costs. Specifically, our approach enables training ASTGNNs on the largest scale spatial-temporal dataset using a single A6000 equipped with 48 GB of memory, overcoming the out-of-memory issue encountered during original training and even achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we delve into the effectiveness of the GWT from the perspective of spectral graph theory, providing substantial theoretical support. This advancement not only proves the existence of efficient sub-networks within ASTGNNs but also broadens the applicability of the LTH in resource-constrained settings, marking a significant step forward in the field of graph neural networks.

Generally, the two tasks are handled separately in traditional paradigms and a few methods have started to explore modeling these two tasks in a joint manner recently. However, these approaches suffer from the limitations of single-frame training and inconsistent coordinate representations between tracking and prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a streaming and unified framework for joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and trajectory Prediction (StreamMOTP) to address the above challenges. Firstly, we construct the model in a streaming manner and exploit a memory bank to preserve and leverage the long-term latent features for tracked objects more effectively. Secondly, a relative spatio-temporal positional encoding strategy is introduced to bridge the gap of coordinate representations between the two tasks and maintain the pose-invariance for trajectory prediction. Thirdly, we further improve the quality and consistency of predicted trajectories with a dual-stream predictor. We conduct extensive experiments on popular nuSences dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of StreamMOTP, which outperforms previous methods significantly on both tasks. Furthermore, we also prove that the proposed framework has great potential and advantages in actual applications of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stable and Storage-efficient Dataset Distillation: Matching Convexified Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19827v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of deep learning and large language models has led to an exponential growth in the demand for training data, prompting the development of Dataset Distillation methods to address the challenges of managing large datasets. Among these, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) has been a prominent approach, which replicates the training trajectory of an expert network on real data with a synthetic dataset. However, our investigation found that this method suffers from three significant limitations: 1. Instability of expert trajectory generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); 2. Low convergence speed of the distillation process; 3. High storage consumption of the expert trajectory. To address these issues, we offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of Dataset Distillation and MTT through a simple transformation of the objective function, and introduce a novel method called Matching Convexified Trajectory (MCT), which aims to provide better guidance for the student trajectory. MCT leverages insights from the linearized dynamics of Neural Tangent Kernel methods to create a convex combination of expert trajectories, guiding the student network to converge rapidly and stably. This trajectory is not only easier to store, but also enables a continuous sampling strategy during distillation, ensuring thorough learning and fitting of the entire expert trajectory. Comprehensive experiments across three public datasets validate the superiority of MCT over traditional MTT methods.</p></details> | 11 pages |

One network branch crafts an initial collision-free trajectory estimate, while the other devises a neural collision constraint for subsequent optimization, ensuring trajectory continuity and adherence to physicalactuation limits. Extensive simulations in challenging cluttered environments, involving up to 25 robots and 25% obstacle density, show a collision avoidance success rate in the range of 100 -- 85%. Finally, we introduce a saliency map computation method acting on the point cloud data, offering qualitative insights into our methodology.</p></details> |  |

It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Beyond Human Preferences: Exploring Reinforcement Learning Trajectory Evaluation and Improvement through LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19644v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in evaluating policy trajectories within intricate game tasks due to the difficulty in designing comprehensive and precise reward functions. This inherent difficulty curtails the broader application of RL within game environments characterized by diverse constraints. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) presents a pioneering framework that capitalizes on human preferences as pivotal reward signals, thereby circumventing the need for meticulous reward engineering. However, obtaining preference data from human experts is costly and inefficient, especially under conditions marked by complex constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose a LLM-enabled automatic preference generation framework named LLM4PG , which harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to abstract trajectories, rank preferences, and reconstruct reward functions to optimize conditioned policies. Experiments on tasks with complex language constraints demonstrated the effectiveness of our LLM-enabled reward functions, accelerating RL convergence and overcoming stagnation caused by slow or absent progress under original reward structures. This approach mitigates the reliance on specialized human knowledge and demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance RL's effectiveness in complex environments in the wild.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Can Trajectory Generation Combine Privacy and Utility?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07218v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While location trajectories represent a valuable data source for analyses and location-based services, they can reveal sensitive information, such as political and religious preferences. Differentially private publication mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework, we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all requirements. Thus, we perform an experimental study evaluating the applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain. Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic guarantees remains an open research question and propose concrete next steps for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added DOI: 10.56553/popets-2024-0068</p></details> |

LiDAR point clouds can be used directly to assemble 3D models if their positions are accurately determined. AeroTraj uses SLAM for this, but must ensure complete and accurate reconstruction while minimizing drone battery usage. Doing this requires balancing competing constraints: drone speed, height, and orientation. AeroTraj exploits building geometry in designing an optimal trajectory that incorporates these constraints. Even with an optimal trajectory, SLAM's position error can drift over time, so AeroTraj tracks drift in-flight by offloading computations to the cloud and invokes a re-calibration procedure to minimize error. AeroTraj can reconstruct large structures with centimeter-level accuracy and with an average end-to-end latency below 250 ms, significantly outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

The Fiedler value is adopted as communication performance metric. The validity of the method in computing both feasible and optimal trajectories for the robots is demonstrated both in simulation and experimentally. Results show that the constraint on the Fiedler value ensures that the robot network fulfils its objective while maintaining communication connectivity at all times. Further, the paper shows that the introduction of approximations for the constraints enables a significant improvement in the computational time of the solution, which remain very close to the optimal solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Stage Goal-Driven Network for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18050v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of various applications, including autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems. This paper proposes a novel method for pedestrian trajectory prediction, called multi-stage goal-driven network (MGNet). Diverging from prior approaches relying on stepwise recursive prediction and the singular forecasting of a long-term goal, MGNet directs trajectory generation by forecasting intermediate stage goals, thereby reducing prediction errors. The network comprises three main components: a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), an attention module, and a multi-stage goal evaluator. Trajectories are encoded using conditional variational autoencoders to acquire knowledge about the approximate distribution of pedestrians' future trajectories, and combined with an attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependency between trajectory sequences. The pivotal module is the multi-stage goal evaluator, which utilizes the encoded feature vectors to predict intermediate goals, effectively minimizing cumulative errors in the recursive inference process. The effectiveness of MGNet is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the JAAD and PIE datasets. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms reveal significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by 5th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL 2024)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a method that leverages anticipatory road data, such as speed limits, road slopes, and traffic lights, beyond the local perception range to optimize energy-efficient braking trajectories. For that, coasting, which reduces energy consumption, and active braking are combined to transition from the current vehicle velocity to a lower target velocity at a given distance ahead. Finding the switching instants between the coasting phases and the continuous control for the braking phase is addressed as an optimal trade-off between maximizing coasting periods and minimizing braking effort. The resulting switched optimal control problem is solved by deriving necessary optimality conditions. To facilitate the incorporation of additional feasibility constraints for multi-phase trajectories, a sub-optimal alternative solution based on parametric optimization is proposed. Both methods are compared in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to appear at the European Control Conference 2024 (ECC'24)</p></details> |

However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the Cinematographer, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions. (2) Next, a Gaussian-driven Multi-view Latent Diffusion Model serves as the Decorator, modeling the image sequence distribution given the camera trajectories and texts. This model, fine-tuned from a 2D diffusion model, directly generates pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians as an immediate 3D scene representation for consistent denoising. (3) Lastly, the 3D Gaussians are refined by a novel SDS++ loss as the Detailer, which incorporates the prior of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Director3D outperforms existing methods, offering superior performance in real-world 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/imlixinyang/director3d</p></details> |

First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate GPS trajectories into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Desire line maps are widely deployed for traffic flow analysis by virtue of their ease of interpretation and computation. They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. GPS trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the GPS trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching APIs produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the GPS trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical GPS trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeTraj: Tuning-Free Trajectory Control in Video Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16863v1)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion model has demonstrated remarkable capability in video generation, which further sparks interest in introducing trajectory control into the generation process. While existing works mainly focus on training-based methods (e.g., conditional adapter), we argue that diffusion model itself allows decent control over the generated content without requiring any training. In this study, we introduce a tuning-free framework to achieve trajectory-controllable video generation, by imposing guidance on both noise construction and attention computation. Specifically, 1) we first show several instructive phenomenons and analyze how initial noises influence the motion trajectory of generated content. 2) Subsequently, we propose FreeTraj, a tuning-free approach that enables trajectory control by modifying noise sampling and attention mechanisms. 3) Furthermore, we extend FreeTraj to facilitate longer and larger video generation with controllable trajectories. Equipped with these designs, users have the flexibility to provide trajectories manually or opt for trajectories automatically generated by the LLM trajectory planner. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the trajectory controllability of video diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://haonanqiu.com/projects/FreeTraj.html, Code Repo: https://github.com/arthur-qiu/FreeTraj</p></details> |

Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |
| **[Bad Habits: Policy Confounding and Out-of-Trajectory Generalization in RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02419v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning agents tend to develop habits that are effective only under specific policies. Following an initial exploration phase where agents try out different actions, they eventually converge onto a particular policy. As this occurs, the distribution over state-action trajectories becomes narrower, leading agents to repeatedly experience the same transitions. This repetitive exposure fosters spurious correlations between certain observations and rewards. Agents may then pick up on these correlations and develop simplistic habits tailored to the specific set of trajectories dictated by their policy. The problem is that these habits may yield incorrect outcomes when agents are forced to deviate from their typical trajectories, prompted by changes in the environment. This paper presents a mathematical characterization of this phenomenon, termed policy confounding, and illustrates, through a series of examples, the circumstances under which it occurs.</p></details> |  |

Towards this end, we introduce some natural notions of the complexity of optimization trajectories, both qualitative and quantitative, which hallmark the directional nature of optimization in neural networks: when is there redundancy, and when exploration. We use them to reveal the inherent nuance and interplay involved between various optimization choices, such as momentum and weight decay. Further, the trajectory perspective helps us see the effect of scale on regularizing the directional nature of trajectories, and as a by-product, we also observe an intriguing heterogeneity of Q,K,V dynamics in the middle attention layers in LLMs and which is homogenized by scale. Importantly, we put the significant directional redundancy observed to the test by demonstrating that training only scalar batchnorm parameters some while into training matches the performance of training the entire network, which thus exhibits the potential of hybrid optimization schemes that are geared towards efficiency.</p></details> | Preprint, 57 pages |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis reduces sample size requirements and expedites time-to-efficacy signals in advanced cancer clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02529v4)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis is limited to single unidirectional endpoints, most advanced cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are powered for either progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</p></details> |  |

With the change in modern UAV application scenarios, it is required that UAVs have fast maneuverable three-dimensional flight capabilities. Due to the highly nonlinear aerodynamics produced by the fuselage and wings of the tail-sitter, how to quickly generate a smooth and executable trajectory is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. We constrain the speed of the tail-sitter, eliminate the differential dynamics constraints in the trajectory generation process of the tail-sitter through differential flatness, and allocate the time variable of the trajectory through the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method named MINCO. By discretizing the trajectory in time, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint, thereby achieving the time-optimal trajectory for the tail-sitter to fly through any given waypoints.</p></details> |  |

Existing planning methods suffer from issues such as long computation times, limited capacity to address intricate obstacle models, and lack of consideration for external disturbances and measurement inaccuracies in these high-dimensional systems. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning approach that combines Dynamic Control Barrier Function (DCBF) with a disturbance observer to create a Robust Dynamic Control Barrier Function (RDCBF) planner. This approach successfully plans trajectories in environments with complex dynamic obstacles while accounting for external disturbances and measurement uncertainties, ensuring system safety and enabling precise obstacle avoidance. Experimental results on a mobile manipulator demonstrate outstanding performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization of Trajectories for Machine Learning Training in Robot Accuracy Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15620v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been developed for increasing the accuracy of robot mechanisms. Complex mechanical issues such as non-linear friction, backlash, flexibility of structure transmission elements can cause these errors and they are hard to model. ML requires training data and the above mechanical phenomena are highly dependent on position of the robot in the workspace and also on its velocity, especially near zero velocity in both directions where non-linearities such as Streibek and Coulomb friction are most pronounced. It is well known that success of ML methods depends on amount of training data and it is expensive/time consuming to collect data from physical robot motion. We therefore address the problem of searching for trajectories in the 6D space of positions and velocities which collect the most information in the least amount of time. This reduces to a special case of the traveling-salesman problem in that the robot must be programmed to visit sampled points in the position-velocity phase space most efficiently. Two goals of this work are 1) Computationally study the difficulty of the TSP in this application by applying it to X, Y, Z motion in 3D space (6D phase space) and 2) assess the effectiveness of an extremely simple Nearest Neighbor search algorithm compared to random sampling of the search space. Results confirm that Nearest Neighbor heuristic searching produces significantly better trajectories than random sampling in this application.</p></details> |  |

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of extracting 3D condylar trajectories from 2D real-time MRI and to assess their precision.Twenty healthy subjects underwent real-time MRI while opening and closing their jaws. One axial and two sagittal slices were segmented using a U-Net-based algorithm. The centers of mass of the resulting masks were projected onto the coordinate system based on anatomical markers and temporally adjusted using a common projection. The quality of the computed trajectories was evaluated using metrics designed to estimate movement reproducibility, head motion, and slice placement symmetry.The segmentation of the axial slices demonstrated good-to-excellent quality; however, the segmentation of the sagittal slices required some fine-tuning. The movement reproducibility was acceptable for most cases; nevertheless, head motion displaced the trajectories by 1 mm on average. The difference in the superior-inferior coordinate of the condyles in the closed jaw position was 1.7 mm on average.Despite limitations in precision, real-time MRI enables the extraction of condylar trajectories with sufficient accuracy for evaluating clinically relevant parameters such as condyle displacement, trajectories aspect, and symmetry.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTOP addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTOP is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTOP for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTOP outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> |  |

This study develops a heuristic test based on singular value curve analysis of data matrices containing deterministic and Gaussian noise signals. The minimum detection criteria are identified, and statistical and matrix space analysis developed to determine upper and lower bounds. This study applies the analysis to representative examples by using recorded trajectories of mixed deterministic and stochastic trajectories for multi-agent, cellular automata, and biological video. Examples include Cucker Smale and Vicsek flocking, Gaussian noise and its integration, recorded observations of bird flocking, and 1D cellular automata. Ensemble simulations including measurement noise are performed to compute statistical variation and discussed relative to random matrix theory noise bounds. The results indicate singular knee analysis of recorded trajectories can detect gradated levels on a continuum of structure and noise. Across the eight singular value decay metrics considered, the angle subtended at the singular value knee emerges with the most potential for supporting cross-embodiment emergence detection, the size of noise bounds is used as an indication of required sample size, and the presence of a large fraction of singular values inside noise bounds as an indication of noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures; includes 2 supplementary pages</p></details> |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |

To address this, we propose FutureNet, which explicitly integrates initially predicted trajectories into the future scenario and further encodes these future contexts to enhance subsequent forecasting. Additionally, most previous motion forecasting works have focused on predicting independent futures for each agent. However, safe and smooth autonomous driving requires accurately predicting the diverse future behaviors of numerous surrounding agents jointly in complex dynamic environments. Given that all agents occupy certain potential travel spaces and possess lane driving priority, we propose Lane Occupancy Field (LOF), a new representation with lane semantics for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. LOF can simultaneously capture the joint probability distribution of all road participants' future spatial-temporal positions. Due to the high compatibility between lane occupancy field prediction and trajectory prediction, we propose a novel network with future context encoding for the joint prediction of these two tasks. Our approach ranks 1st on two large-scale motion forecasting benchmarks: Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To further improve these experiences, agents need to be personalized and proactive. By effectively comprehending user intentions through their actions and interactions with GUIs, agents will be better positioned to achieve these goals. This paper introduces the task of goal identification from observed UI trajectories, aiming to infer the user's intended task based on their GUI interactions. We propose a novel evaluation metric to assess whether two task descriptions are paraphrases within a specific UI environment.

Our model considers the intentions of other vehicles in the decision-making process and provides the AV with a human-like trajectory, based on the clothoid interpolation technique.% This study investigates a solver based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that quickly converges to an optimal decision.Among highly interactive traffic scenarios, the intersection crossing is particularly challenging. Hence, we choose to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method in real traffic conditions, using an experimental autonomous vehicle at an unsignalized intersection. Testing results reveal that our approach is suitable for 1) Making decisions and generating trajectories simultaneously. 2) Describing the vehicle's trajectory as a piecewise clothoid and enforcing geometric constraints. 3) Reducing search space dimensionality for the trajectory optimization problem.</p></details> |  |

This task is even more difficult in a dynamic environment, e.g., objects are moving. This paper presents a \emph{modular} zero-shot framework for language-driven manipulation of (dynamic) objects through a closed-loop control system with real-time trajectory replanning and an online 6D object pose localization. We segment an object within $\SI{0.5}{\second}$ by leveraging a vision language model via language commands. Then, guided by natural language commands, a closed-loop system, including a unified pose estimation and tracking and online trajectory planning, is utilized to continuously track this object and compute the optimal trajectory in real-time. Our proposed zero-shot framework provides a smooth trajectory that avoids jerky movements and ensures the robot can grasp a non-stationary object. Experiment results exhibit the real-time capability of the proposed zero-shot modular framework for the trajectory optimization module to accurately and efficiently grasp moving objects, i.e., up to \SI{30}{\hertz} update rates for the online 6D pose localization module and \SI{10}{\hertz} update rates for the receding-horizon trajectory optimization. These advantages highlight the modular framework's potential applications in robotics and human-robot interaction; see the video in https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/6e64/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signatures Meet Dynamic Programming: Generalizing Bellman Equations for Trajectory Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05547v2)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path signatures have been proposed as a powerful representation of paths that efficiently captures the path's analytic and geometric characteristics, having useful algebraic properties including fast concatenation of paths through tensor products. Signatures have recently been widely adopted in machine learning problems for time series analysis. In this work we establish connections between value functions typically used in optimal control and intriguing properties of path signatures. These connections motivate our novel control framework with signature transforms that efficiently generalizes the Bellman equation to the space of trajectories. We analyze the properties and advantages of the framework, termed signature control. In particular, we demonstrate that (i) it can naturally deal with varying/adaptive time steps; (ii) it propagates higher-level information more efficiently than value function updates; (iii) it is robust to dynamical system misspecification over long rollouts. As a specific case of our framework, we devise a model predictive control method for path tracking. This method generalizes integral control, being suitable for problems with unknown disturbances. The proposed algorithms are tested in simulation, with differentiable physics models including typical control and robotics tasks such as point-mass, curve following for an ant model, and a robotic manipulator.</p></details> | 48 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Temporal Prediction of Continuous Disease Trajectories and Treatment Effects Using Neural SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12807v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized medicine based on medical images, including predicting future individualized clinical disease progression and treatment response, would have an enormous impact on healthcare and drug development, particularly for diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS)) with long term, complex, heterogeneous evolutions and no cure. In this work, we present the first stochastic causal temporal framework to model the continuous temporal evolution of disease progression via Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE). The proposed causal inference model takes as input the patient's high dimensional images (MRI) and tabular data, and predicts both factual and counterfactual progression trajectories on different treatments in latent space. The NSDE permits the estimation of high-confidence personalized trajectories and treatment effects. Extensive experiments were performed on a large, multi-centre, proprietary dataset of patient 3D MRI and clinical data acquired during several randomized clinical trials for MS treatments. Our results present the first successful uncertainty-based causal Deep Learning (DL) model to: (a) accurately predict future patient MS disability evolution (e.g. EDSS) and treatment effects leveraging baseline MRI, and (b) permit the discovery of subgroups of patients for which the model has high confidence in their response to treatment even in clinical trials which did not reach their clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models as Zero-Shot Trajectory Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11604v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise as high-level planners for robots when given access to a selection of low-level skills. However, it is often assumed that LLMs do not possess sufficient knowledge to be used for the low-level trajectories themselves. In this work, we address this assumption thoroughly, and investigate if an LLM (GPT-4) can directly predict a dense sequence of end-effector poses for manipulation tasks, when given access to only object detection and segmentation vision models. We designed a single, task-agnostic prompt, without any in-context examples, motion primitives, or external trajectory optimisers. Then we studied how well it can perform across 30 real-world language-based tasks, such as "open the bottle cap" and "wipe the plate with the sponge", and we investigated which design choices in this prompt are the most important. Our conclusions raise the assumed limit of LLMs for robotics, and we reveal for the first time that LLMs do indeed possess an understanding of low-level robot control sufficient for a range of common tasks, and that they can additionally detect failures and then re-plan trajectories accordingly.

| **[Adaptive Uncertainty Quantification for Trajectory Prediction Under Distributional Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12100v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Crossfusor: A Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model for Car-Following Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11941v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for advancing autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. While traditional methods have laid foundational work, modern deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models and generative approaches, have significantly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex and non-linear patterns in vehicle motion and traffic interactions. However, these models often overlook the detailed car-following behaviors and inter-vehicle interactions essential for real-world driving scenarios. This study introduces a Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model (Crossfusor) specifically designed for car-following trajectory prediction. Crossfusor integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a robust diffusion framework, improving both the accuracy and realism of predicted trajectories. The model leverages a novel temporal feature encoding framework combining GRU, location-based attention mechanisms, and Fourier embedding to capture historical vehicle dynamics. It employs noise scaled by these encoded historical features in the forward diffusion process, and uses a cross-attention transformer to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies in the reverse denoising process. Experimental results on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that Crossfusor outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in long-term predictions, showcasing its potential for enhancing the predictive capabilities of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Koopmon trajectories in nonadiabatic quantum-classical dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13878v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to alleviate the computational costs of fully quantum nonadiabatic dynamics, we present a mixed quantum-classical (MQC) particle method based on the theory of Koopman wavefunctions. Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons - sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second version. 40 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[A First Physical-World Trajectory Prediction Attack via LiDAR-induced Deceptions in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11707v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction forecasts nearby agents' moves based on their historical trajectories. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Existing attacks compromise the prediction model of a victim AV by directly manipulating the historical trajectory of an attacker AV, which has limited real-world applicability. This paper, for the first time, explores an indirect attack approach that induces prediction errors via attacks against the perception module of a victim AV. Although it has been shown that physically realizable attacks against LiDAR-based perception are possible by placing a few objects at strategic locations, it is still an open challenge to find an object location from the vast search space in order to launch effective attacks against prediction under varying victim AV velocities. Through analysis, we observe that a prediction model is prone to an attack focusing on a single point in the scene. Consequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework to realize the single-point attack. The first stage of prediction-side attack efficiently identifies, guided by the distribution of detection results under object-based attacks against perception, the state perturbations for the prediction model that are effective and velocity-insensitive. In the second stage of location matching, we match the feasible object locations with the found state perturbations. Our evaluation using a public autonomous driving dataset shows that our attack causes a collision rate of up to 63% and various hazardous responses of the victim AV. The effectiveness of our attack is also demonstrated on a real testbed car. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first security analysis spanning from LiDAR-based perception to prediction in autonomous driving, leading to a realistic attack on prediction. To counteract the proposed attack, potential defenses are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium 2024</p></details> |

This approach addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting by leveraging the generation of trajectories from previously encountered tasks to augment the current dataset. However, existing deep generative replay methods for continual learning rely on autoregressive models, which suffer from compounding errors in the generated trajectories. In this paper, we propose a simple, scalable, and non-autoregressive method for continual learning in decision-making tasks using a generative model that generates task samples conditioned on the trajectory timestep. We evaluate our method on Continual World benchmarks and find that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the average success rate metric among continual learning methods.

Currently, there exists no principled mathematical theory for their dynamics -- a grand-challenge open problem. Here, we show that the popularity and similarity trajectories of nodes in hyperbolic embeddings of different real networks manifest universal self-similar properties with typical Hurst exponents $H \ll 0.5$. This means that the trajectories are predictable, displaying anti-persistent or 'mean-reverting' behavior, and they can be adequately captured by a fractional Brownian motion process. The observed behavior can be qualitatively reproduced in synthetic networks that possess a latent geometric space, but not in networks that lack such space, suggesting that the observed subdiffusive dynamics are inherently linked to the hidden geometry of real networks. These results set the foundations for rigorous mathematical machinery for describing and predicting real network dynamics.</p></details> |  |
| **[IKLink: End-Effector Trajectory Tracking with Minimal Reconfigurations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16154v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many applications require a robot to accurately track reference end-effector trajectories. Certain trajectories may not be tracked as single, continuous paths due to the robot's kinematic constraints or obstacles elsewhere in the environment. In this situation, it becomes necessary to divide the trajectory into shorter segments. Each such division introduces a reconfiguration, in which the robot deviates from the reference trajectory, repositions itself in configuration space, and then resumes task execution. The occurrence of reconfigurations should be minimized because they increase the time and energy usage. In this paper, we present IKLink, a method for finding joint motions to track reference end-effector trajectories while executing minimal reconfigurations. Our graph-based method generates a diverse set of Inverse Kinematics (IK) solutions for every waypoint on the reference trajectory and utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal motion by linking the IK solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IKLink through a simulation experiment and an illustrative demonstration using a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a contributed paper at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline. This approach enhances efficient GPS data preparation and facilitates a deeper understanding of cycling behavior and the cycling environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

While many trajectory planning frameworks have been successful, there still exists potential for improvements, particularly in enhancing the speed of generating efficient trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical trajectory planning framework to reduce computational time and memory usage called MINER-RRT*, which consists of two main components. First, we propose a sampling-based path planning method boosted by neural networks, where the predicted heuristic region accelerates the convergence of rapidly-exploring random trees. Second, we utilize the optimal conditions derived from the quadrotor's differential flatness properties to construct polynomial trajectories that minimize control effort in multiple stages. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our method can generate high-quality trajectories with better performance in 3D cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that, compared to direct learning, physical residual learning is preferred for PDE solving.</p></details> |  |

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeTra: A Unified Model for Object Detection and Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04426v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tasks of object detection and trajectory forecasting play a crucial role in understanding the scene for autonomous driving. These tasks are typically executed in a cascading manner, making them prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, there is usually a very thin interface between the two tasks, creating a lossy information bottleneck. To address these challenges, our approach formulates the union of the two tasks as a trajectory refinement problem, where the first pose is the detection (current time), and the subsequent poses are the waypoints of the multiple forecasts (future time). To tackle this unified task, we design a refinement transformer that infers the presence, pose, and multi-modal future behaviors of objects directly from LiDAR point clouds and high-definition maps. We call this model DeTra, short for object Detection and Trajectory forecasting. In our experiments, we observe that \ourmodel{} outperforms the state-of-the-art on Argoverse 2 Sensor and Waymo Open Dataset by a large margin, across a broad range of metrics. Last but not least, we perform extensive ablation studies that show the value of refinement for this task, that every proposed component contributes positively to its performance, and that key design choices were made.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-JEPA: A Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Trajectory Similarity Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12913v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity computation is an essential technique for analyzing moving patterns of spatial data across various applications such as traffic management, wildlife tracking, and location-based services. Modern methods often apply deep learning techniques to approximate heuristic metrics but struggle to learn more robust and generalized representations from the vast amounts of unlabeled trajectory data. Recent approaches focus on self-supervised learning methods such as contrastive learning, which have made significant advancements in trajectory representation learning. However, contrastive learning-based methods heavily depend on manually pre-defined data augmentation schemes, limiting the diversity of generated trajectories and resulting in learning from such variations in 2D Euclidean space, which prevents capturing high-level semantic variations. To address these limitations, we propose T-JEPA, a self-supervised trajectory similarity computation method employing Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to enhance trajectory representation learning. T-JEPA samples and predicts trajectory information in representation space, enabling the model to infer the missing components of trajectories at high-level semantics without relying on domain knowledge or manual effort. Extensive experiments conducted on three urban trajectory datasets and two Foursquare datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of T-JEPA in trajectory similarity computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Scenarios Based on Graph Neural Network and Numerical Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08855v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In unstructured environments, obstacles are diverse and lack lane markings, making trajectory planning for intelligent vehicles a challenging task. Traditional trajectory planning methods typically involve multiple stages, including path planning, speed planning, and trajectory optimization. These methods require the manual design of numerous parameters for each stage, resulting in significant workload and computational burden. While end-to-end trajectory planning methods are simple and efficient, they often fail to ensure that the trajectory meets vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints in unstructured scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and numerical optimization. The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) initial trajectory prediction using the GNN, (2) trajectory optimization using numerical optimization. First, the graph neural network processes the environment information and predicts a rough trajectory, replacing traditional path and speed planning. This predicted trajectory serves as the initial solution for the numerical optimization stage, which optimizes the trajectory to ensure compliance with vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints. We conducted simulation experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and compared it with other mainstream planning algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed method simplifies the trajectory planning process and significantly improves planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Video Segmenter by Tracking Objects Along Axial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18537v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video segmentation requires consistently segmenting and tracking objects over time. Due to the quadratic dependency on input size, directly applying self-attention to video segmentation with high-resolution input features poses significant challenges, often leading to insufficient GPU memory capacity. Consequently, modern video segmenters either extend an image segmenter without incorporating any temporal attention or resort to window space-time attention in a naive manner. In this work, we present Axial-VS, a general and simple framework that enhances video segmenters by tracking objects along axial trajectories. The framework tackles video segmentation through two sub-tasks: short-term within-clip segmentation and long-term cross-clip tracking. In the first step, Axial-VS augments an off-the-shelf clip-level video segmenter with the proposed axial-trajectory attention, sequentially tracking objects along the height- and width-trajectories within a clip, thereby enhancing temporal consistency by capturing motion trajectories. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense features, and outperforms the window space-time attention in segmentation quality. In the second step, we further employ axial-trajectory attention to the object queries in clip-level segmenters, which are learned to encode object information, thereby aiding object tracking across different clips and achieving consistent segmentation throughout the video. Without bells and whistles, Axial-VS showcases state-of-the-art results on video segmentation benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in addressing the limitations of modern clip-level video segmenters.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Lavenant et al. arXiv:2102.09204 addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure. Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free method of arXiv:2205.07146 in key scenarios.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs. cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generalized Pointing Error Model for FSO Links with Fixed-Wing UAVs for 6G: Analysis and Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05444v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Free-space optical (FSO) communication is a promising solution to support wireless backhaul links in emerging 6G non-terrestrial networks. At the link level, pointing errors in FSO links can significantly impact capacity, making accurate modeling of these errors essential for both assessing and enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for FSO pointing errors in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that incorporates three-dimensional (3D) jitter, including roll, pitch, and yaw angle jittering. We derive a probability density function for the pointing error angle based on the relative position and posture of the UAV to the ground station. This model is then integrated into a trajectory optimization problem designed to maximize energy efficiency while meeting constraints on speed, acceleration, and elevation angle. Our proposed optimization method significantly improves energy efficiency by adjusting the UAV's flight trajectory to minimize exposure to directions highly affected by jitter. The simulation results emphasize the importance of using UAV-specific 3D jitter models in achieving accurate performance measurements and effective system optimization in FSO communication networks. Utilizing our generalized model, the optimized trajectories achieve up to 11.8 percent higher energy efficiency compared to those derived from conventional Gaussian pointing error models.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under revision; IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning at V2I-enabled Intersections based on Correlated Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05336v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating trajectories that ensure both vehicle safety and improve traffic efficiency remains a challenging task at intersections. Many existing works utilize Nash equilibrium (NE) for the trajectory planning at intersections. However, NE-based planning can hardly guarantee that all vehicles are in the same equilibrium, leading to a risk of collision. In this work, we propose a framework for trajectory planning based on Correlated Equilibrium (CE) when V2I communication is also enabled. The recommendation with CE allows all vehicles to reach a safe and consensual equilibrium and meanwhile keeps the rationality as NE-based methods that no vehicle has the incentive to deviate. The Intersection Manager (IM) first collects the trajectory library and the personal preference probabilities over the library from each vehicle in a low-resolution spatial-temporal grid map. Then, the IM optimizes the recommendation probability distribution for each vehicle's trajectory by minimizing overall collision probability under the CE constraint. Finally, each vehicle samples a trajectory of the low-resolution map to construct a safety corridor and derive a smooth trajectory with a local refinement optimization. We conduct comparative experiments at a crossroad intersection involving two and four vehicles, validating the effectiveness of our method in balancing vehicle safety and traffic efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,12 figures,Submission to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

When the generalization error of the SDE approximation closely aligns with that of SGD in expectation, it provides two opportunities for understanding better the generalization behaviour of SGD through its SDE approximation. Firstly, viewing SGD as full-batch gradient descent with Gaussian gradient noise allows us to obtain trajectory-based generalization bound using the information-theoretic bound from Xu and Raginsky [2017]. Secondly, assuming mild conditions, we estimate the steady-state weight distribution of SDE and use information-theoretic bounds from Xu and Raginsky [2017] and Negrea et al. [2019] to establish terminal-state-based generalization bounds. Our proposed bounds have some advantages, notably the trajectory-based bound outperforms results in Wang and Mao [2022], and the terminal-state-based bound exhibits a fast decay rate comparable to stability-based bounds.</p></details> | Accepted by UAI 2024 |
| **[Dynamic Multi-Objective Lion Swarm Optimization with Multi-strategy Fusion: An application in 6R robot trajectory planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00114v2)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of industrialization has spurred the development of innovative swarm intelligence algorithms, with Lion Swarm Optimization (LSO) notable for its robustness, parallelism, simplicity, and efficiency. While LSO excels in single-objective optimization, its multi-objective variants face challenges such as poor initialization, local optima entrapment, and so on. This study proposes Dynamic Multi-Objective Lion Swarm Optimization with Multi-strategy Fusion (MF-DMOLSO) to address these limitations. MF-DMOLSO comprises three key components: initialization, swarm position update, and external archive update. The initialization unit employs chaotic mapping for uniform population distribution. The position update unit enhances behavior patterns and step size formulas for cub lions, incorporating crowding degree sorting, Pareto non-dominated sorting, and Levy flight to improve convergence speed and global search capabilities. Reference points guide convergence in higher-dimensional spaces, maintaining population diversity. An adaptive cold-hot start strategy generates a population responsive to environmental changes. The external archive update unit re-evaluates solutions based on non-domination and diversity to form the new population. Evaluations on benchmark functions showed MF-DMOLSO surpassed multi-objective particle swarm optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and multi-objective lion swarm optimization, exceeding 90% accuracy for two-objective and 97% for three-objective problems. Compared to non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III, MF-DMOLSO showed a 60% improvement. Applied to 6R robot trajectory planning, MF-DMOLSO optimized running time and maximum acceleration to 8.3s and 0.3pi rad/s^2, achieving a set coverage rate of 70.97% compared to 2% by multi-objective particle swarm optimization, thus improving efficiency and reducing mechanical dither.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |
| **[REPLAY: Modeling Time-Varying Temporal Regularities of Human Mobility for Location Prediction over Sparse Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16310v3)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Location prediction forecasts a user's location based on historical user mobility traces. To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |

However, the difficulty of collecting human demonstration data for complex tasks makes learning efficient representations of those trajectories challenging. For many problems, such as for dexterous manipulation, the exact timings of the trajectories should be factored from their spatial path characteristics. In this work, we propose TimewarpVAE, a fully differentiable manifold-learning algorithm that incorporates Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to simultaneously learn both timing variations and latent factors of spatial variation. We show how the TimewarpVAE algorithm learns appropriate time alignments and meaningful representations of spatial variations in handwriting and fork manipulation datasets. Our results have lower spatial reconstruction test error than baseline approaches and the learned low-dimensional representations can be used to efficiently generate semantically meaningful novel trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm to generate novel high-speed trajectories for a robotic arm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artif...</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS): Theory, Algorithms, and Applications Workshop at IJCAI '24</p></details> |
| **[ATraDiff: Accelerating Online Reinforcement Learning with Imaginary Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04323v1)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training autonomous agents with sparse rewards is a long-standing problem in online reinforcement learning (RL), due to low data efficiency. Prior work overcomes this challenge by extracting useful knowledge from offline data, often accomplished through the learning of action distribution from offline data and utilizing the learned distribution to facilitate online RL. However, since the offline data are given and fixed, the extracted knowledge is inherently limited, making it difficult to generalize to new tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages offline data to learn a generative diffusion model, coined as Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff). This model generates synthetic trajectories, serving as a form of data augmentation and consequently enhancing the performance of online RL methods. The key strength of our diffuser lies in its adaptability, allowing it to effectively handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data. Because of its simplicity, ATraDiff seamlessly integrates with a wide spectrum of RL methods. Empirical evaluation shows that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of environments, with particularly pronounced improvements in complicated settings.

| **[Harmonious Group Choreography with Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06189v2)** | 2024-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creating group choreography from music has gained attention in cultural entertainment and virtual reality, aiming to coordinate visually cohesive and diverse group movements. Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we address the task as the problem of inferring dense, long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories, we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain, without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this, our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However, temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected, and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings, we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN, and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally, we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix, and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of overfitting, we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The results demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness.

| **[Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

The multi-rotor will operate in the presence of external disturbances and modeling errors. At the same time, the reference trajectory is unknown and generated from a reference system with unknown or partially known dynamics. We assume the only measurements that are available are the position and orientation of the multi-rotor and the position of the reference system. We adopt an extended high-gain observer (EHGO) estimation framework to estimate the unmeasured multi-rotor states, modeling errors, external disturbances, and the reference trajectory. We design a robust output feedback controller for trajectory tracking that comprises a feedback linearizing controller and the EHGO. The proposed control method is rigorously analyzed to establish its stability properties. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results through numerical simulation and experimental validation in which a multi-rotor tracks a moving ground vehicle with an unknown trajectory and dynamics and successfully lands on the vehicle while in motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control.

| **[Improved context-sensitive transformer model for inland vessel trajectory prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02771v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-related and model-based vessel trajectory prediction is highly accurate but requires specific knowledge of the vessel under consideration which is not always practical. Machine learning-based trajectory prediction models do not require expert knowledge, but rely on the implicit knowledge extracted from massive amounts of data. Several deep learning (DL) methods for vessel trajectory prediction have recently been suggested. The DL models developed typically only process information about the (dis)location of vessels defined with respect to a global reference system. In the context of inland navigation, this can be problematic, since without knowledge of the limited navigable space, irrealistic trajectories are likely to be determined. If spatial constraintes are introduced, e.g., by implementing an additional submodule to process map data, however, overall complexity increases. Instead of processing the vessel displacement information on the one hand and the spatial information on the other hand, the paper proposes the merging of both information. Here, fairway-related and navigation-related displacement information are used directly. In this way, the previously proposed context-sensitive Classification Transformer (CSCT) shows an improved spatial awareness. Additionally, the CSCT is adapted to assess the model uncertainty by enabling dropout during inference. This approach is trained on different inland waterways to analyze its generalizability. As the improved CSCT obtains lower prediction errors and enables to estimate the trustworthiness of each prediction, it is more suitable for safety-critical applications in inland navigation than previously developed models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Short-term Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Encoder-Decoder Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02770v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is necessary for save and efficient navigation. Deep learning-based prediction models, esp. encoder-decoders, are rarely applied to inland navigation specifically. Approaches from the maritime domain cannot directly be transferred to river navigation due to specific driving behavior influencing factors. Different encoder-decoder architectures, including a transformer encoder-decoder, are compared herein for predicting the next positions of inland vessels, given not only spatio-temporal information from AIS, but also river specific features. The results show that the reformulation of the regression task as classification problem and the inclusion of river specific features yield the lowest displacement errors. The standard LSTM encoder-decoder outperforms the transformer encoder-decoder for the data considered, but is computationally more expensive. In this study for the first time a transformer-based encoder-decoder model is applied to the problem of predicting the ship trajectory. Here, a feature vector using the river-specific context of navigation input parameters is established. Future studies can built on the proposed models, investigate the improvement of the computationally more efficient transformer, e.g. through further hyper-parameter optimization, and use additional river-specific information in the context representation to further increase prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and social situation-aware transformer-based trajectory prediction of autonomous systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02767v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous transportation systems such as road vehicles or vessels require the consideration of the static and dynamic environment to dislocate without collision. Anticipating the behavior of an agent in a given situation is required to adequately react to it in time. Developing deep learning-based models has become the dominant approach to motion prediction recently. The social environment is often considered through a CNN-LSTM-based sub-module processing a $\textit{social tensor}$ that includes information of the past trajectory of surrounding agents. For the proposed transformer-based trajectory prediction model, an alternative, computationally more efficient social tensor definition and processing is suggested. It considers the interdependencies between target and surrounding agents at each time step directly instead of relying on information of last hidden LSTM states of individually processed agents. A transformer-based sub-module, the Social Tensor Transformer, is integrated into the overall prediction model. It is responsible for enriching the target agent's dislocation features with social interaction information obtained from the social tensor. For the awareness of spatial limitations, dislocation features are defined in relation to the navigable area. This replaces additional, computationally expensive map processing sub-modules. An ablation study shows, that for longer prediction horizons, the deviation of the predicted trajectory from the ground truth is lower compared to a spatially and socially agnostic model. Even if the performance gain from a spatial-only to a spatial and social context-sensitive model is small in terms of common error measures, by visualizing the results it can be shown that the proposed model in fact is able to predict reactions to surrounding agents and explicitely allows an interpretable behavior.</p></details> |  |

Automatically modeling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal labels for an existing dataset of children's stories originally annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the categorical labels to the continuous valence and arousal space. For predicting the thus obtained emotionality signals, we fine-tune a DeBERTa model and improve upon this baseline via a weakly supervised learning approach. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of $.8221$ for valence and $.7125$ for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach. A detailed analysis shows the extent to which the results vary depending on factors such as the author, the individual story, or the section within the story. In addition, we uncover the weaknesses of our approach by investigating examples that prove to be difficult to predict.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Findings. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.11382</p></details> |

The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level.

First, we use the blocking technique to show that RCPS attains performance guarantees similar to those enjoyed in the iid setting whenever data is generated by asymptotically stationary and contractive dynamics. Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity. We conclude by discussing how these tools could be used toward a unified analysis of online and offline conformal prediction algorithms, which are currently treated with very different tools.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Mobile edge computing (MEC) offers a solution, offloading computationally intensive tasks to edge cloud servers, reducing battery drain compared to local processing. The upcoming integrated sensing and communication in mobile communication may improve the trajectory prediction and processing delays. This study proposes a greedy resource allocation optimization strategy for multi-user networks to minimize aggregate energy usage. Numerical results show potential improvement at 33\% for every 1000 iteration. Addressing prediction model division and velocity accuracy issues is crucial for better results.

| **[StreamMOTP: Streaming and Unified Framework for Joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19844v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking and trajectory prediction are two crucial modules in autonomous driving systems. Generally, the two tasks are handled separately in traditional paradigms and a few methods have started to explore modeling these two tasks in a joint manner recently. However, these approaches suffer from the limitations of single-frame training and inconsistent coordinate representations between tracking and prediction tasks. In this paper, we propose a streaming and unified framework for joint 3D Multi-Object Tracking and trajectory Prediction (StreamMOTP) to address the above challenges. Firstly, we construct the model in a streaming manner and exploit a memory bank to preserve and leverage the long-term latent features for tracked objects more effectively. Secondly, a relative spatio-temporal positional encoding strategy is introduced to bridge the gap of coordinate representations between the two tasks and maintain the pose-invariance for trajectory prediction. Thirdly, we further improve the quality and consistency of predicted trajectories with a dual-stream predictor. We conduct extensive experiments on popular nuSences dataset and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of StreamMOTP, which outperforms previous methods significantly on both tasks. Furthermore, we also prove that the proposed framework has great potential and advantages in actual applications of autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Stable and Storage-efficient Dataset Distillation: Matching Convexified Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19827v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of deep learning and large language models has led to an exponential growth in the demand for training data, prompting the development of Dataset Distillation methods to address the challenges of managing large datasets. Among these, Matching Training Trajectories (MTT) has been a prominent approach, which replicates the training trajectory of an expert network on real data with a synthetic dataset. However, our investigation found that this method suffers from three significant limitations: 1. Instability of expert trajectory generated by Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD); 2. Low convergence speed of the distillation process; 3. High storage consumption of the expert trajectory. To address these issues, we offer a new perspective on understanding the essence of Dataset Distillation and MTT through a simple transformation of the objective function, and introduce a novel method called Matching Convexified Trajectory (MCT), which aims to provide better guidance for the student trajectory. MCT leverages insights from the linearized dynamics of Neural Tangent Kernel methods to create a convex combination of expert trajectories, guiding the student network to converge rapidly and stably. This trajectory is not only easier to store, but also enables a continuous sampling strategy during distillation, ensuring thorough learning and fitting of the entire expert trajectory. Comprehensive experiments across three public datasets validate the superiority of MCT over traditional MTT methods.</p></details> | 11 pages |

Our approach consists of a 2-fork neural network fed with sensing and localization data, able to communicate intermediate learned features among the agents. One network branch crafts an initial collision-free trajectory estimate, while the other devises a neural collision constraint for subsequent optimization, ensuring trajectory continuity and adherence to physicalactuation limits. Extensive simulations in challenging cluttered environments, involving up to 25 robots and 25% obstacle density, show a collision avoidance success rate in the range of 100 -- 85%. Finally, we introduce a saliency map computation method acting on the point cloud data, offering qualitative insights into our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Viewport Prediction for Volumetric Video Streaming by Exploring Video Saliency and Trajectory Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16462v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Volumetric video, also known as hologram video, is a novel medium that portrays natural content in Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Mixed Reality (MR). It is expected to be the next-gen video technology and a prevalent use case for 5G and beyond wireless communication. Considering that each user typically only watches a section of the volumetric video, known as the viewport, it is essential to have precise viewport prediction for optimal performance. However, research on this topic is still in its infancy. In the end, this paper presents and proposes a novel approach, named Saliency and Trajectory Viewport Prediction (STVP), which aims to improve the precision of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. The STVP extensively utilizes video saliency information and viewport trajectory. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of viewport prediction in volumetric video streaming. In particular, we introduce a novel sampling method, Uniform Random Sampling (URS), to reduce computational complexity while still preserving video features in an efficient manner. Then we present a saliency detection technique that incorporates both spatial and temporal information for detecting static, dynamic geometric, and color salient regions. Finally, we intelligently fuse saliency and trajectory information to achieve more accurate viewport prediction. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed viewport prediction methods using state-of-the-art volumetric video sequences. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method over existing schemes. The dataset and source code will be publicly accessible after acceptance.</p></details> |  |

This framework leverages recent advancements in discrete-time dynamic graph (DTDG) models to adeptly handle the temporal dynamics inherent in dynamic graphs. DyGETViz effectively captures both micro- and macro-level structural shifts within these graphs, offering a robust method for representing complex and massive dynamic graphs. The application of DyGETViz extends to a diverse array of domains, including ethology, epidemiology, finance, genetics, linguistics, communication studies, social studies, and international relations. Through its implementation, DyGETViz has revealed or confirmed various critical insights. These include the diversity of content sharing patterns and the degree of specialization within online communities, the chronological evolution of lexicons across decades, and the distinct trajectories exhibited by aging-related and non-related genes. Importantly, DyGETViz enhances the accessibility of scientific findings to non-domain experts by simplifying the complexities of dynamic graphs. Our framework is released as an open-source Python package for use across diverse disciplines. Our work not only addresses the ongoing challenges in visualizing and analyzing DTDG models but also establishes a foundational framework for future investigations into dynamic graph representation and analysis across various disciplines.</p></details> | 27 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Beyond Human Preferences: Exploring Reinforcement Learning Trajectory Evaluation and Improvement through LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19644v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in evaluating policy trajectories within intricate game tasks due to the difficulty in designing comprehensive and precise reward functions. This inherent difficulty curtails the broader application of RL within game environments characterized by diverse constraints. Preference-based reinforcement learning (PbRL) presents a pioneering framework that capitalizes on human preferences as pivotal reward signals, thereby circumventing the need for meticulous reward engineering. However, obtaining preference data from human experts is costly and inefficient, especially under conditions marked by complex constraints. To tackle this challenge, we propose a LLM-enabled automatic preference generation framework named LLM4PG , which harnesses the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to abstract trajectories, rank preferences, and reconstruct reward functions to optimize conditioned policies. Experiments on tasks with complex language constraints demonstrated the effectiveness of our LLM-enabled reward functions, accelerating RL convergence and overcoming stagnation caused by slow or absent progress under original reward structures. This approach mitigates the reliance on specialized human knowledge and demonstrates the potential of LLMs to enhance RL's effectiveness in complex environments in the wild.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoK: Can Trajectory Generation Combine Privacy and Utility?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07218v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While location trajectories represent a valuable data source for analyses and location-based services, they can reveal sensitive information, such as political and religious preferences. Differentially private publication mechanisms have been proposed to allow for analyses under rigorous privacy guarantees. However, the traditional protection schemes suffer from a limiting privacy-utility trade-off and are vulnerable to correlation and reconstruction attacks. Synthetic trajectory data generation and release represent a promising alternative to protection algorithms. While initial proposals achieve remarkable utility, they fail to provide rigorous privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a framework for designing a privacy-preserving trajectory publication approach by defining five design goals, particularly stressing the importance of choosing an appropriate Unit of Privacy. Based on this framework, we briefly discuss the existing trajectory protection approaches, emphasising their shortcomings. This work focuses on the systematisation of the state-of-the-art generative models for trajectories in the context of the proposed framework. We find that no existing solution satisfies all requirements. Thus, we perform an experimental study evaluating the applicability of six sequential generative models to the trajectory domain. Finally, we conclude that a generative trajectory model providing semantic guarantees remains an open research question and propose concrete next steps for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added DOI: 10.56553/popets-2024-0068</p></details> |

LiDAR point clouds can be used directly to assemble 3D models if their positions are accurately determined. AeroTraj uses SLAM for this, but must ensure complete and accurate reconstruction while minimizing drone battery usage. Doing this requires balancing competing constraints: drone speed, height, and orientation. AeroTraj exploits building geometry in designing an optimal trajectory that incorporates these constraints. Even with an optimal trajectory, SLAM's position error can drift over time, so AeroTraj tracks drift in-flight by offloading computations to the cloud and invokes a re-calibration procedure to minimize error. AeroTraj can reconstruct large structures with centimeter-level accuracy and with an average end-to-end latency below 250 ms, significantly outperforming the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Multi-Robot Communication-Aware Trajectory Planning by Constraining the Fiedler Value](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18452v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper present a novel approach for the solution of the Multi-Robot Communication-Aware Trajectory Planning, which builds on a general optimisation framework where the changes in robots positions are used as decision variable, and linear constraints on the trajectories of the robots are introduced to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. The Fiedler value is adopted as communication performance metric. The validity of the method in computing both feasible and optimal trajectories for the robots is demonstrated both in simulation and experimentally. Results show that the constraint on the Fiedler value ensures that the robot network fulfils its objective while maintaining communication connectivity at all times. Further, the paper shows that the introduction of approximations for the constraints enables a significant improvement in the computational time of the solution, which remain very close to the optimal solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Stage Goal-Driven Network for Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18050v1)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction plays a pivotal role in ensuring the safety and efficiency of various applications, including autonomous vehicles and traffic management systems. This paper proposes a novel method for pedestrian trajectory prediction, called multi-stage goal-driven network (MGNet). Diverging from prior approaches relying on stepwise recursive prediction and the singular forecasting of a long-term goal, MGNet directs trajectory generation by forecasting intermediate stage goals, thereby reducing prediction errors. The network comprises three main components: a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE), an attention module, and a multi-stage goal evaluator. Trajectories are encoded using conditional variational autoencoders to acquire knowledge about the approximate distribution of pedestrians' future trajectories, and combined with an attention mechanism to capture the temporal dependency between trajectory sequences. The pivotal module is the multi-stage goal evaluator, which utilizes the encoded feature vectors to predict intermediate goals, effectively minimizing cumulative errors in the recursive inference process. The effectiveness of MGNet is demonstrated through comprehensive experiments on the JAAD and PIE datasets. Comparative evaluations against state-of-the-art algorithms reveal significant performance improvements achieved by our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by 5th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Energy-Efficient Braking Trajectories with Anticipatory Road Data for Automated Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17604v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning in automated driving typically focuses on satisfying safety and comfort requirements within the vehicle's onboard sensor range. This paper introduces a method that leverages anticipatory road data, such as speed limits, road slopes, and traffic lights, beyond the local perception range to optimize energy-efficient braking trajectories. For that, coasting, which reduces energy consumption, and active braking are combined to transition from the current vehicle velocity to a lower target velocity at a given distance ahead. Finding the switching instants between the coasting phases and the continuous control for the braking phase is addressed as an optimal trade-off between maximizing coasting periods and minimizing braking effort. The resulting switched optimal control problem is solved by deriving necessary optimality conditions. To facilitate the incorporation of additional feasibility constraints for multi-phase trajectories, a sub-optimal alternative solution based on parametric optimization is proposed. Both methods are compared in simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint to appear at the European Control Conference 2024 (ECC'24)</p></details> |

However, the potential of adopting real-world datasets, which can produce significantly more realistic 3D scenes, remains largely unexplored. In this work, we delve into the key challenge of the complex and scene-specific camera trajectories found in real-world captures. We introduce Director3D, a robust open-world text-to-3D generation framework, designed to generate both real-world 3D scenes and adaptive camera trajectories. To achieve this, (1) we first utilize a Trajectory Diffusion Transformer, acting as the Cinematographer, to model the distribution of camera trajectories based on textual descriptions. (2) Next, a Gaussian-driven Multi-view Latent Diffusion Model serves as the Decorator, modeling the image sequence distribution given the camera trajectories and texts. This model, fine-tuned from a 2D diffusion model, directly generates pixel-aligned 3D Gaussians as an immediate 3D scene representation for consistent denoising. (3) Lastly, the 3D Gaussians are refined by a novel SDS++ loss as the Detailer, which incorporates the prior of the 2D diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Director3D outperforms existing methods, offering superior performance in real-world 3D generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/imlixinyang/director3d</p></details> |
| **[Robot Agnostic Visual Servoing considering kinematic constraints enabled by a decoupled network trajectory planner structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07017v2)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a visual servoing method consisting of a detection network and a velocity trajectory planner. First, the detection network estimates the objects position and orientation in the image space. Furthermore, these are normalized and filtered. The direction and orientation is then the input to the trajectory planner, which considers the kinematic constrains of the used robotic system. This allows safe and stable control, since the kinematic boundary values are taken into account in planning. Also, by having direction estimation and velocity planner separated, the learning part of the method does not directly influence the control value. This also enables the transfer of the method to different robotic systems without retraining, therefore being robot agnostic. We evaluate our method on different visual servoing tasks with and without clutter on two different robotic systems. Our method achieved mean absolute position errors of <0.5 mm and orientation errors of <1{\deg}. Additionally, we transferred the method to a new system which differs in robot and camera, emphasizing robot agnostic capability of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Using iterated local alignment to aggregate GPS trajectories into a traffic flow map](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17500v1)** | 2024-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Desire line maps are widely deployed for traffic flow analysis by virtue of their ease of interpretation and computation. They can be considered to be simplified traffic flow maps, whereas the computational challenges in aggregating small scale traffic flows prevent the wider dissemination of high resolution flow maps. GPS trajectories are a promising data source to solve this challenging problem. The solution begins with the alignment (or map matching) of the GPS trajectories to the road network. However even the state-of-the-art map matching APIs produce sub-optimal results with small misalignments. While these misalignments are negligible for large scale flow aggregation in desire line maps, they pose substantial obstacles for small scale flow aggregation in high resolution maps. To remove these remaining misalignments, we introduce innovative local alignment algorithms, where we infer road segments to serve as local reference segments, and proceed to align nearby road segments to them. With each local alignment iteration, the misalignments of the GPS trajectories with each other and with the road network are reduced, and so converge closer to a minimal flow map. By analysing a set of empirical GPS trajectories collected in Hannover, Germany, we confirm that our minimal flow map has high levels of spatial resolution, accuracy and coverage.</p></details> |  |

While existing works mainly focus on training-based methods (e.g., conditional adapter), we argue that diffusion model itself allows decent control over the generated content without requiring any training. In this study, we introduce a tuning-free framework to achieve trajectory-controllable video generation, by imposing guidance on both noise construction and attention computation. Specifically, 1) we first show several instructive phenomenons and analyze how initial noises influence the motion trajectory of generated content. 2) Subsequently, we propose FreeTraj, a tuning-free approach that enables trajectory control by modifying noise sampling and attention mechanisms. 3) Furthermore, we extend FreeTraj to facilitate longer and larger video generation with controllable trajectories. Equipped with these designs, users have the flexibility to provide trajectories manually or opt for trajectories automatically generated by the LLM trajectory planner. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our approach in enhancing the trajectory controllability of video diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://haonanqiu.com/projects/FreeTraj.html, Code Repo: https://github.com/arthur-qiu/FreeTraj</p></details> |

Existing approaches generally perform multi-horizon FTP tasks in an autoregressive manner, thereby suffering from error accumulation and low-efficiency problems. In this paper, a novel framework, called FlightBERT++, is proposed to i) forecast multi-horizon flight trajectories directly in a non-autoregressive way, and ii) improve the limitation of the binary encoding (BE) representation in the FlightBERT framework. Specifically, the proposed framework is implemented by a generalized encoder-decoder architecture, in which the encoder learns the temporal-spatial patterns from historical observations and the decoder predicts the flight status for the future horizons. Compared to conventional architecture, an innovative horizon-aware contexts generator is dedicatedly designed to consider the prior horizon information, which further enables non-autoregressive multi-horizon prediction. Additionally, the Gray code representation and the differential prediction paradigm are designed to cope with the high-bit misclassifications of the BE representation, which significantly reduces the outliers in the predictions. Moreover, a differential prompted decoder is proposed to enhance the capability of the differential predictions by leveraging the stationarity of the differential sequence. Extensive experiments are conducted to validate the proposed framework on a real-world flight trajectory dataset. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework outperformed the competitive baselines in both FTP performance and computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ex...</summary><p>An extend version based on the AAAI version</p></details> |
| **[Bad Habits: Policy Confounding and Out-of-Trajectory Generalization in RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02419v2)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning agents tend to develop habits that are effective only under specific policies. Following an initial exploration phase where agents try out different actions, they eventually converge onto a particular policy. As this occurs, the distribution over state-action trajectories becomes narrower, leading agents to repeatedly experience the same transitions. This repetitive exposure fosters spurious correlations between certain observations and rewards. Agents may then pick up on these correlations and develop simplistic habits tailored to the specific set of trajectories dictated by their policy. The problem is that these habits may yield incorrect outcomes when agents are forced to deviate from their typical trajectories, prompted by changes in the environment. This paper presents a mathematical characterization of this phenomenon, termed policy confounding, and illustrates, through a series of examples, the circumstances under which it occurs.</p></details> |  |

Towards this end, we introduce some natural notions of the complexity of optimization trajectories, both qualitative and quantitative, which hallmark the directional nature of optimization in neural networks: when is there redundancy, and when exploration. We use them to reveal the inherent nuance and interplay involved between various optimization choices, such as momentum and weight decay. Further, the trajectory perspective helps us see the effect of scale on regularizing the directional nature of trajectories, and as a by-product, we also observe an intriguing heterogeneity of Q,K,V dynamics in the middle attention layers in LLMs and which is homogenized by scale. Importantly, we put the significant directional redundancy observed to the test by demonstrating that training only scalar batchnorm parameters some while into training matches the performance of training the entire network, which thus exhibits the potential of hybrid optimization schemes that are geared towards efficiency.</p></details> | Preprint, 57 pages |
| **[Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis reduces sample size requirements and expedites time-to-efficacy signals in advanced cancer clinical trials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02529v4)** | 2024-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Kaplan-Meier (KM) analysis is limited to single unidirectional endpoints, most advanced cancer randomized clinical trials (RCTs) are powered for either progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS). This discards efficacy information carried by partial responses, complete responses, and stable disease that frequently precede progressive disease and death. Chauhan Weighted Trajectory Analysis (CWTA) is a generalization of KM that simultaneously assesses multiple rank-ordered endpoints. We hypothesized that CWTA could use this efficacy information to reduce sample size requirements and expedite efficacy signals in advanced cancer trials. We performed 100-fold and 1000-fold simulations of solid tumour systemic therapy RCTs with health statuses rank ordered from complete response (Stage 0) to death (Stage 4). At increments of sample size and hazard ratio, we compared KM PFS and OS with CWTA for (i) sample size requirements to achieve a power of 0.8 and (ii) time-to-first significant efficacy signal. CWTA consistently demonstrated greater power, and reduced sample size requirements by 18% to 35% compared to KM PFS and 14% to 20% compared to KM OS. CWTA also expedited time-to-efficacy signals 2- to 6-fold. CWTA, by incorporating all efficacy signals in the cancer treatment trajectory, provides clinically relevant reduction in required sample size and meaningfully expedites the efficacy signals of cancer treatments compared to KM PFS and KM OS. Using CWTA rather than KM as the primary trial outcome has the potential to meaningfully reduce the numbers of patients, trial duration, and costs to evaluate therapies in advanced cancer.</p></details> |  |

We establish a set of mild assumptions, under which we show that TO converges numerically stably to a locally optimal and feasible solution up to arbitrary user-specified error tolerance. Our key observation is that all prior works use SQP as a black-box solver, where a TO problem is formulated as a Nonlinear Program (NLP) and the underlying SQP solver is not allowed to modify the NLP. Instead, we propose a white-box TO solver, where the SQP solver is informed with characteristics of the objective function and the dynamic system. It then uses these characteristics to derive approximate dynamic systems and customize the discretization schemes.</p></details> |  |

With the change in modern UAV application scenarios, it is required that UAVs have fast maneuverable three-dimensional flight capabilities. Due to the highly nonlinear aerodynamics produced by the fuselage and wings of the tail-sitter, how to quickly generate a smooth and executable trajectory is a problem that needs to be solved urgently. We constrain the speed of the tail-sitter, eliminate the differential dynamics constraints in the trajectory generation process of the tail-sitter through differential flatness, and allocate the time variable of the trajectory through the state-of-the-art trajectory generation method named MINCO. By discretizing the trajectory in time, we convert the speed constraint on the vehicle into a soft constraint, thereby achieving the time-optimal trajectory for the tail-sitter to fly through any given waypoints.</p></details> |  |

Existing planning methods suffer from issues such as long computation times, limited capacity to address intricate obstacle models, and lack of consideration for external disturbances and measurement inaccuracies in these high-dimensional systems. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning approach that combines Dynamic Control Barrier Function (DCBF) with a disturbance observer to create a Robust Dynamic Control Barrier Function (RDCBF) planner. This approach successfully plans trajectories in environments with complex dynamic obstacles while accounting for external disturbances and measurement uncertainties, ensuring system safety and enabling precise obstacle avoidance. Experimental results on a mobile manipulator demonstrate outstanding performance of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization of Trajectories for Machine Learning Training in Robot Accuracy Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15620v1)** | 2024-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, machine learning (ML) methods have been developed for increasing the accuracy of robot mechanisms. Complex mechanical issues such as non-linear friction, backlash, flexibility of structure transmission elements can cause these errors and they are hard to model. ML requires training data and the above mechanical phenomena are highly dependent on position of the robot in the workspace and also on its velocity, especially near zero velocity in both directions where non-linearities such as Streibek and Coulomb friction are most pronounced. It is well known that success of ML methods depends on amount of training data and it is expensive/time consuming to collect data from physical robot motion. We therefore address the problem of searching for trajectories in the 6D space of positions and velocities which collect the most information in the least amount of time. This reduces to a special case of the traveling-salesman problem in that the robot must be programmed to visit sampled points in the position-velocity phase space most efficiently. Two goals of this work are 1) Computationally study the difficulty of the TSP in this application by applying it to X, Y, Z motion in 3D space (6D phase space) and 2) assess the effectiveness of an extremely simple Nearest Neighbor search algorithm compared to random sampling of the search space. Results confirm that Nearest Neighbor heuristic searching produces significantly better trajectories than random sampling in this application.</p></details> |  |

This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of extracting 3D condylar trajectories from 2D real-time MRI and to assess their precision.Twenty healthy subjects underwent real-time MRI while opening and closing their jaws. One axial and two sagittal slices were segmented using a U-Net-based algorithm. The centers of mass of the resulting masks were projected onto the coordinate system based on anatomical markers and temporally adjusted using a common projection. The quality of the computed trajectories was evaluated using metrics designed to estimate movement reproducibility, head motion, and slice placement symmetry.The segmentation of the axial slices demonstrated good-to-excellent quality; however, the segmentation of the sagittal slices required some fine-tuning. The movement reproducibility was acceptable for most cases; nevertheless, head motion displaced the trajectories by 1 mm on average. The difference in the superior-inferior coordinate of the condyles in the closed jaw position was 1.7 mm on average.Despite limitations in precision, real-time MRI enables the extraction of condylar trajectories with sufficient accuracy for evaluating clinically relevant parameters such as condyle displacement, trajectories aspect, and symmetry.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTOP addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTOP is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTOP for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTOP outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[ImageFlowNet: Forecasting Multiscale Trajectories of Disease Progression with Irregularly-Sampled Longitudinal Medical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14794v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forecasting of disease progression from images is a holy grail for clinical decision making. However, this task is complicated by the inherent high dimensionality, temporal sparsity and sampling irregularity in longitudinal image acquisitions. Existing methods often rely on extracting hand-crafted features and performing time-series analysis in this vector space, leading to a loss of rich spatial information within the images. To overcome these challenges, we introduce ImageFlowNet, a novel framework that learns latent-space flow fields that evolve multiscale representations in joint embedding spaces using neural ODEs and SDEs to model disease progression in the image domain. Notably, ImageFlowNet learns multiscale joint representation spaces by combining cohorts of patients together so that information can be transferred between the patient samples. The dynamics then provide plausible trajectories of progression, with the SDE providing alternative trajectories from the same starting point. We provide theoretical insights that support our formulation of ODEs, and motivate our regularizations involving high-level visual features, latent space organization, and trajectory smoothness. We then demonstrate ImageFlowNet's effectiveness through empirical evaluations on three longitudinal medical image datasets depicting progression in retinal geographic atrophy, multiple sclerosis, and glioblastoma.</p></details> |  |
| **[Singular knee identification to support emergence recognition in physical swarm and cellular automata trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14652v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After decades of attention, emergence continues to lack a centralized mathematical definition that leads to a rigorous emergence test applicable to physical flocks and swarms, particularly those containing both deterministic elements (eg, interactions) and stochastic perturbations like measurement noise. This study develops a heuristic test based on singular value curve analysis of data matrices containing deterministic and Gaussian noise signals. The minimum detection criteria are identified, and statistical and matrix space analysis developed to determine upper and lower bounds. This study applies the analysis to representative examples by using recorded trajectories of mixed deterministic and stochastic trajectories for multi-agent, cellular automata, and biological video. Examples include Cucker Smale and Vicsek flocking, Gaussian noise and its integration, recorded observations of bird flocking, and 1D cellular automata. Ensemble simulations including measurement noise are performed to compute statistical variation and discussed relative to random matrix theory noise bounds. The results indicate singular knee analysis of recorded trajectories can detect gradated levels on a continuum of structure and noise. Across the eight singular value decay metrics considered, the angle subtended at the singular value knee emerges with the most potential for supporting cross-embodiment emergence detection, the size of noise bounds is used as an indication of required sample size, and the presence of a large fraction of singular values inside noise bounds as an indication of noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 11 figures; includes 2 supplementary pages</p></details> |
| **[ICAL: Continual Learning of Multimodal Agents by Transforming Trajectories into Actionable Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14596v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: http://ical-learning.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[FutureNet-LOF: Joint Trajectory Prediction and Lane Occupancy Field Prediction with Future Context Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14422v1)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most prior motion prediction endeavors in autonomous driving have inadequately encoded future scenarios, leading to predictions that may fail to accurately capture the diverse movements of agents (e.g., vehicles or pedestrians). To address this, we propose FutureNet, which explicitly integrates initially predicted trajectories into the future scenario and further encodes these future contexts to enhance subsequent forecasting. Additionally, most previous motion forecasting works have focused on predicting independent futures for each agent. However, safe and smooth autonomous driving requires accurately predicting the diverse future behaviors of numerous surrounding agents jointly in complex dynamic environments. Given that all agents occupy certain potential travel spaces and possess lane driving priority, we propose Lane Occupancy Field (LOF), a new representation with lane semantics for motion forecasting in autonomous driving. LOF can simultaneously capture the joint probability distribution of all road participants' future spatial-temporal positions. Due to the high compatibility between lane occupancy field prediction and trajectory prediction, we propose a novel network with future context encoding for the joint prediction of these two tasks. Our approach ranks 1st on two large-scale motion forecasting benchmarks: Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2.</p></details> | 10 pages |

To further improve these experiences, agents need to be personalized and proactive. By effectively comprehending user intentions through their actions and interactions with GUIs, agents will be better positioned to achieve these goals. This paper introduces the task of goal identification from observed UI trajectories, aiming to infer the user's intended task based on their GUI interactions. We propose a novel evaluation metric to assess whether two task descriptions are paraphrases within a specific UI environment. By Leveraging the inverse relation with the UI automation task, we utilized the Android-In-The-Wild and Mind2Web datasets for our experiments. Using our metric and these datasets, we conducted several experiments comparing the performance of humans and state-of-the-art models, specifically GPT-4 and Gemini-1.5 Pro. Our results show that Gemini performs better than GPT but still underperforms compared to humans, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

Our model considers the intentions of other vehicles in the decision-making process and provides the AV with a human-like trajectory, based on the clothoid interpolation technique.% This study investigates a solver based on Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) that quickly converges to an optimal decision.Among highly interactive traffic scenarios, the intersection crossing is particularly challenging. Hence, we choose to demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our method in real traffic conditions, using an experimental autonomous vehicle at an unsignalized intersection. Testing results reveal that our approach is suitable for 1) Making decisions and generating trajectories simultaneously. 2) Describing the vehicle's trajectory as a piecewise clothoid and enforcing geometric constraints. 3) Reducing search space dimensionality for the trajectory optimization problem.</p></details> |  |

This task is even more difficult in a dynamic environment, e.g., objects are moving. This paper presents a \emph{modular} zero-shot framework for language-driven manipulation of (dynamic) objects through a closed-loop control system with real-time trajectory replanning and an online 6D object pose localization. We segment an object within $\SI{0.5}{\second}$ by leveraging a vision language model via language commands. Then, guided by natural language commands, a closed-loop system, including a unified pose estimation and tracking and online trajectory planning, is utilized to continuously track this object and compute the optimal trajectory in real-time. Our proposed zero-shot framework provides a smooth trajectory that avoids jerky movements and ensures the robot can grasp a non-stationary object. Experiment results exhibit the real-time capability of the proposed zero-shot modular framework for the trajectory optimization module to accurately and efficiently grasp moving objects, i.e., up to \SI{30}{\hertz} update rates for the online 6D pose localization module and \SI{10}{\hertz} update rates for the receding-horizon trajectory optimization. These advantages highlight the modular framework's potential applications in robotics and human-robot interaction; see the video in https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/6e64/.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Safe and Non-Conservative Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving Handling Unanticipated Behaviors of Traffic Participants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13396v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory planning for autonomous driving is challenging because the unknown future motion of traffic participants must be accounted for, yielding large uncertainty. Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC)-based planners provide non-conservative planning, but do not rule out a (small) probability of collision. We propose a control scheme that yields an efficient trajectory based on SMPC when the traffic scenario allows, still avoiding that the vehicle causes collisions with traffic participants if the latter move according to the prediction assumptions. If some traffic participant does not behave as anticipated, no safety guarantee can be given. Then, our approach yields a trajectory which minimizes the probability of collision, using Constraint Violation Probability Minimization techniques. Our algorithm can also be adapted to minimize the anticipated harm caused by a collision. We provide a thorough discussion of the benefits of our novel control scheme and compare it to a previous approach through numerical simulations from the CommonRoad database.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signatures Meet Dynamic Programming: Generalizing Bellman Equations for Trajectory Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05547v2)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Path signatures have been proposed as a powerful representation of paths that efficiently captures the path's analytic and geometric characteristics, having useful algebraic properties including fast concatenation of paths through tensor products. Signatures have recently been widely adopted in machine learning problems for time series analysis. In this work we establish connections between value functions typically used in optimal control and intriguing properties of path signatures. These connections motivate our novel control framework with signature transforms that efficiently generalizes the Bellman equation to the space of trajectories. We analyze the properties and advantages of the framework, termed signature control. In particular, we demonstrate that (i) it can naturally deal with varying/adaptive time steps; (ii) it propagates higher-level information more efficiently than value function updates; (iii) it is robust to dynamical system misspecification over long rollouts. As a specific case of our framework, we devise a model predictive control method for path tracking. This method generalizes integral control, being suitable for problems with unknown disturbances. The proposed algorithms are tested in simulation, with differentiable physics models including typical control and robotics tasks such as point-mass, curve following for an ant model, and a robotic manipulator.</p></details> | 48 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Probabilistic Temporal Prediction of Continuous Disease Trajectories and Treatment Effects Using Neural SDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12807v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized medicine based on medical images, including predicting future individualized clinical disease progression and treatment response, would have an enormous impact on healthcare and drug development, particularly for diseases (e.g. multiple sclerosis (MS)) with long term, complex, heterogeneous evolutions and no cure. In this work, we present the first stochastic causal temporal framework to model the continuous temporal evolution of disease progression via Neural Stochastic Differential Equations (NSDE). The proposed causal inference model takes as input the patient's high dimensional images (MRI) and tabular data, and predicts both factual and counterfactual progression trajectories on different treatments in latent space. The NSDE permits the estimation of high-confidence personalized trajectories and treatment effects. Extensive experiments were performed on a large, multi-centre, proprietary dataset of patient 3D MRI and clinical data acquired during several randomized clinical trials for MS treatments. Our results present the first successful uncertainty-based causal Deep Learning (DL) model to: (a) accurately predict future patient MS disability evolution (e.g. EDSS) and treatment effects leveraging baseline MRI, and (b) permit the discovery of subgroups of patients for which the model has high confidence in their response to treatment even in clinical trials which did not reach their clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models as Zero-Shot Trajectory Generators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11604v2)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown promise as high-level planners for robots when given access to a selection of low-level skills. However, it is often assumed that LLMs do not possess sufficient knowledge to be used for the low-level trajectories themselves. In this work, we address this assumption thoroughly, and investigate if an LLM (GPT-4) can directly predict a dense sequence of end-effector poses for manipulation tasks, when given access to only object detection and segmentation vision models. We designed a single, task-agnostic prompt, without any in-context examples, motion primitives, or external trajectory optimisers. Then we studied how well it can perform across 30 real-world language-based tasks, such as "open the bottle cap" and "wipe the plate with the sponge", and we investigated which design choices in this prompt are the most important. Our conclusions raise the assumed limit of LLMs for robotics, and we reveal for the first time that LLMs do indeed possess an understanding of low-level robot control sufficient for a range of common tasks, and that they can additionally detect failures and then re-plan trajectories accordingly.

| **[Adaptive Uncertainty Quantification for Trajectory Prediction Under Distributional Shift](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12100v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction models that can infer both finite future trajectories and their associated uncertainties of the target vehicles in an online setting (e.g., real-world application scenarios) is crucial for ensuring the safe and robust navigation and path planning of autonomous vehicle motion. However, the majority of existing trajectory prediction models have neither considered reducing the uncertainty as one objective during the training stage nor provided reliable uncertainty quantification during inference stage under potential distribution shift. Therefore, in this paper, we propose the Conformal Uncertainty Quantification under Distribution Shift framework, CUQDS, to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted trajectories of existing trajectory prediction models under potential data distribution shift, while considering improving the prediction accuracy of the models and reducing the estimated uncertainty during the training stage. Specifically, CUQDS includes 1) a learning-based Gaussian process regression module that models the output distribution of the base model (any existing trajectory prediction or time series forecasting neural networks) and reduces the estimated uncertainty by additional loss term, and 2) a statistical-based Conformal P control module to calibrate the estimated uncertainty from the Gaussian process regression module in an online setting under potential distribution shift between training and testing data.</p></details> | 9 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Crossfusor: A Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model for Car-Following Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11941v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle trajectory prediction is crucial for advancing autonomous driving and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), enhancing road safety and traffic efficiency. While traditional methods have laid foundational work, modern deep learning techniques, particularly transformer-based models and generative approaches, have significantly improved prediction accuracy by capturing complex and non-linear patterns in vehicle motion and traffic interactions. However, these models often overlook the detailed car-following behaviors and inter-vehicle interactions essential for real-world driving scenarios. This study introduces a Cross-Attention Transformer Enhanced Conditional Diffusion Model (Crossfusor) specifically designed for car-following trajectory prediction. Crossfusor integrates detailed inter-vehicular interactions and car-following dynamics into a robust diffusion framework, improving both the accuracy and realism of predicted trajectories. The model leverages a novel temporal feature encoding framework combining GRU, location-based attention mechanisms, and Fourier embedding to capture historical vehicle dynamics. It employs noise scaled by these encoded historical features in the forward diffusion process, and uses a cross-attention transformer to model intricate inter-vehicle dependencies in the reverse denoising process. Experimental results on the NGSIM dataset demonstrate that Crossfusor outperforms state-of-the-art models, particularly in long-term predictions, showcasing its potential for enhancing the predictive capabilities of autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

Although conventional MQC models often suffer from consistency issues such as the violation of Heisenberg's principle, we overcame these difficulties by blending Koopman's classical mechanics on Hilbert spaces with methods in symplectic geometry. The resulting continuum model enjoys both a variational and a Hamiltonian structure, while its nonlinear character calls for suitable closures. Benefiting from the underlying action principle, here we apply a regularization technique previously developed within our team. This step allows for a singular solution ansatz which introduces the trajectories of computational particles - the koopmons - sampling the Lagrangian classical paths in phase space. In the case of Tully's nonadiabatic problems, the method reproduces the results of fully quantum simulations with levels of accuracy that are not achieved by standard MQC Ehrenfest simulations. In addition, the koopmon method is computationally advantageous over similar fully quantum approaches, which are also considered in our study. As a further step, we probe the limits of the method by considering the Rabi problem in both the ultrastrong and the deep strong coupling regimes, where MQC treatments appear hardly applicable. In this case, the method succeeds in reproducing parts of the fully quantum results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Secon...</summary><p>Second version. 40 pages, 15 figures</p></details> |
| **[A First Physical-World Trajectory Prediction Attack via LiDAR-induced Deceptions in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11707v1)** | 2024-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction forecasts nearby agents' moves based on their historical trajectories. Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for autonomous vehicles. Existing attacks compromise the prediction model of a victim AV by directly manipulating the historical trajectory of an attacker AV, which has limited real-world applicability. This paper, for the first time, explores an indirect attack approach that induces prediction errors via attacks against the perception module of a victim AV. Although it has been shown that physically realizable attacks against LiDAR-based perception are possible by placing a few objects at strategic locations, it is still an open challenge to find an object location from the vast search space in order to launch effective attacks against prediction under varying victim AV velocities. Through analysis, we observe that a prediction model is prone to an attack focusing on a single point in the scene. Consequently, we propose a novel two-stage attack framework to realize the single-point attack. The first stage of prediction-side attack efficiently identifies, guided by the distribution of detection results under object-based attacks against perception, the state perturbations for the prediction model that are effective and velocity-insensitive. In the second stage of location matching, we match the feasible object locations with the found state perturbations. Our evaluation using a public autonomous driving dataset shows that our attack causes a collision rate of up to 63% and various hazardous responses of the victim AV. The effectiveness of our attack is also demonstrated on a real testbed car. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first security analysis spanning from LiDAR-based perception to prediction in autonomous driving, leading to a realistic attack on prediction. To counteract the proposed attack, potential defenses are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 33rd USENIX Security Symposium 2024</p></details> |

This approach addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting by leveraging the generation of trajectories from previously encountered tasks to augment the current dataset.

Currently, there exists no principled mathematical theory for their dynamics -- a grand-challenge open problem. Here, we show that the popularity and similarity trajectories of nodes in hyperbolic embeddings of different real networks manifest universal self-similar properties with typical Hurst exponents $H \ll 0.5$. This means that the trajectories are predictable, displaying anti-persistent or 'mean-reverting' behavior, and they can be adequately captured by a fractional Brownian motion process. The observed behavior can be qualitatively reproduced in synthetic networks that possess a latent geometric space, but not in networks that lack such space, suggesting that the observed subdiffusive dynamics are inherently linked to the hidden geometry of real networks. These results set the foundations for rigorous mathematical machinery for describing and predicting real network dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Certain trajectories may not be tracked as single, continuous paths due to the robot's kinematic constraints or obstacles elsewhere in the environment. In this situation, it becomes necessary to divide the trajectory into shorter segments. Each such division introduces a reconfiguration, in which the robot deviates from the reference trajectory, repositions itself in configuration space, and then resumes task execution. The occurrence of reconfigurations should be minimized because they increase the time and energy usage. In this paper, we present IKLink, a method for finding joint motions to track reference end-effector trajectories while executing minimal reconfigurations. Our graph-based method generates a diverse set of Inverse Kinematics (IK) solutions for every waypoint on the reference trajectory and utilizes a dynamic programming algorithm to find the globally optimal motion by linking the IK solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IKLink through a simulation experiment and an illustrative demonstration using a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a contributed paper at the 2024 IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |

However, the high volume, noise, and lack of semantic information in this data poses challenges for storage, analysis, and applications. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end pipeline named CycleTrajectory for processing high-sampling rate GPS trajectory data from action cameras, leveraging OpenStreetMap (OSM) for semantic enrichment. The methodology includes (1) Data Preparation, which includes filtration, noise removal, and resampling; (2) Map Matching, which accurately aligns GPS points with road segments using the OSRM API; (3) OSM Data integration to enrich trajectories with road infrastructure details; and (4) Variable Calculation to derive metrics like distance, speed, and infrastructure usage. Validation of the map matching results shows an error rate of 5.64%, indicating the reliability of this pipeline. This approach enhances efficient GPS data preparation and facilitates a deeper understanding of cycling behavior and the cycling environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, conference</p></details> |

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

While many trajectory planning frameworks have been successful, there still exists potential for improvements, particularly in enhancing the speed of generating efficient trajectories. In this paper, we present a novel hierarchical trajectory planning framework to reduce computational time and memory usage called MINER-RRT*, which consists of two main components. First, we propose a sampling-based path planning method boosted by neural networks, where the predicted heuristic region accelerates the convergence of rapidly-exploring random trees. Second, we utilize the optimal conditions derived from the quadrotor's differential flatness properties to construct polynomial trajectories that minimize control effort in multiple stages. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results demonstrate that, compared to several state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, our method can generate high-quality trajectories with better performance in 3D cluttered environments.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we propose and formulate the Physical Trajectory Residual Learning (DeltaPhi), which learns to predict the physical residuals between the pending solved trajectory and a known similar auxiliary trajectory. First, we transform the direct operator mapping between input-output function fields in original training data to residual operator mapping between input function pairs and output function residuals. Next, we learn the surrogate model for the residual operator mapping based on existing neural operator networks. Additionally, we design helpful customized auxiliary inputs for efficient optimization. Through extensive experiments, we conclude that, compared to direct learning, physical residual learning is preferred for PDE solving.</p></details> |  |

The convex cover consists of a set of polytopes such that the union of the polytopes represents obstacle-free space, allowing us to find trajectories for robots that lie within the convex cover. In order to find the SFC that facilitates optimal trajectory generation, we iteratively find overlapping polytopes of maximum volumes that include specified waypoints initialized by a geometric or kinematic planner. Constraints at waypoints appear in two alternating stages of a joint optimization problem, which is solved by a method inspired by the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) with partially distributed variables. We validate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm using a range of parameterized environments and show its applications for two-stage motion planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeTra: A Unified Model for Object Detection and Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04426v2)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tasks of object detection and trajectory forecasting play a crucial role in understanding the scene for autonomous driving. These tasks are typically executed in a cascading manner, making them prone to compounding errors. Furthermore, there is usually a very thin interface between the two tasks, creating a lossy information bottleneck. To address these challenges, our approach formulates the union of the two tasks as a trajectory refinement problem, where the first pose is the detection (current time), and the subsequent poses are the waypoints of the multiple forecasts (future time). To tackle this unified task, we design a refinement transformer that infers the presence, pose, and multi-modal future behaviors of objects directly from LiDAR point clouds and high-definition maps. We call this model DeTra, short for object Detection and Trajectory forecasting. In our experiments, we observe that \ourmodel{} outperforms the state-of-the-art on Argoverse 2 Sensor and Waymo Open Dataset by a large margin, across a broad range of metrics. Last but not least, we perform extensive ablation studies that show the value of refinement for this task, that every proposed component contributes positively to its performance, and that key design choices were made.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-JEPA: A Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture for Trajectory Similarity Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12913v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory similarity computation is an essential technique for analyzing moving patterns of spatial data across various applications such as traffic management, wildlife tracking, and location-based services. Modern methods often apply deep learning techniques to approximate heuristic metrics but struggle to learn more robust and generalized representations from the vast amounts of unlabeled trajectory data. Recent approaches focus on self-supervised learning methods such as contrastive learning, which have made significant advancements in trajectory representation learning. However, contrastive learning-based methods heavily depend on manually pre-defined data augmentation schemes, limiting the diversity of generated trajectories and resulting in learning from such variations in 2D Euclidean space, which prevents capturing high-level semantic variations. To address these limitations, we propose T-JEPA, a self-supervised trajectory similarity computation method employing Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) to enhance trajectory representation learning. T-JEPA samples and predicts trajectory information in representation space, enabling the model to infer the missing components of trajectories at high-level semantics without relying on domain knowledge or manual effort. Extensive experiments conducted on three urban trajectory datasets and two Foursquare datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of T-JEPA in trajectory similarity computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Planning for Autonomous Driving in Unstructured Scenarios Based on Graph Neural Network and Numerical Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08855v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In unstructured environments, obstacles are diverse and lack lane markings, making trajectory planning for intelligent vehicles a challenging task. Traditional trajectory planning methods typically involve multiple stages, including path planning, speed planning, and trajectory optimization. These methods require the manual design of numerous parameters for each stage, resulting in significant workload and computational burden. While end-to-end trajectory planning methods are simple and efficient, they often fail to ensure that the trajectory meets vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints in unstructured scenarios. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel trajectory planning method based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and numerical optimization. The proposed method consists of two stages: (1) initial trajectory prediction using the GNN, (2) trajectory optimization using numerical optimization. First, the graph neural network processes the environment information and predicts a rough trajectory, replacing traditional path and speed planning. This predicted trajectory serves as the initial solution for the numerical optimization stage, which optimizes the trajectory to ensure compliance with vehicle dynamics and obstacle avoidance constraints. We conducted simulation experiments to validate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm and compared it with other mainstream planning algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed method simplifies the trajectory planning process and significantly improves planning efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple Video Segmenter by Tracking Objects Along Axial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18537v2)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video segmentation requires consistently segmenting and tracking objects over time. Due to the quadratic dependency on input size, directly applying self-attention to video segmentation with high-resolution input features poses significant challenges, often leading to insufficient GPU memory capacity. Consequently, modern video segmenters either extend an image segmenter without incorporating any temporal attention or resort to window space-time attention in a naive manner. In this work, we present Axial-VS, a general and simple framework that enhances video segmenters by tracking objects along axial trajectories. The framework tackles video segmentation through two sub-tasks: short-term within-clip segmentation and long-term cross-clip tracking. In the first step, Axial-VS augments an off-the-shelf clip-level video segmenter with the proposed axial-trajectory attention, sequentially tracking objects along the height- and width-trajectories within a clip, thereby enhancing temporal consistency by capturing motion trajectories. The axial decomposition significantly reduces the computational complexity for dense features, and outperforms the window space-time attention in segmentation quality. In the second step, we further employ axial-trajectory attention to the object queries in clip-level segmenters, which are learned to encode object information, thereby aiding object tracking across different clips and achieving consistent segmentation throughout the video. Without bells and whistles, Axial-VS showcases state-of-the-art results on video segmentation benchmarks, emphasizing its effectiveness in addressing the limitations of modern clip-level video segmenters.

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce \textbf{GTA}, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms in both dense and sparse reward settings. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Trajectory Similarity Measurement: An Efficiency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00960v3)** | 2024-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectories that capture object movement have numerous applications, in which similarity computation between trajectories often plays a key role. Traditionally, the similarity between two trajectories is quantified by means of heuristic measures, e.g., Hausdorff or ERP, that operate directly on the trajectories. In contrast, recent studies exploit deep learning to map trajectories to d-dimensional vectors, called embeddings. Then, some distance measure, e.g., Manhattan or Euclidean, is applied to the embeddings to quantify trajectory similarity. The resulting similarities are inaccurate: they only approximate the similarities obtained using the heuristic measures. As distance computation on embeddings is efficient, focus has been on achieving embeddings yielding high accuracy. Adopting an efficiency perspective, we analyze the time complexities of both the heuristic and the learning-based approaches, finding that the time complexities of the former approaches are not necessarily higher. Through extensive experiments on open datasets, we find that, on both CPUs and GPUs, only a few learning-based approaches can deliver the promised higher efficiency, when the embeddings can be pre-computed, while heuristic approaches are more efficient for one-off computations. Among the learning-based approaches, the self-attention-based ones are the fastest to learn embeddings that also yield the highest accuracy for similarity queries. These results have implications for the use of trajectory similarity approaches given different application requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Partially Observed Trajectory Inference using Optimal Transport and a Dynamics Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07475v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory inference seeks to recover the temporal dynamics of a population from snapshots of its (uncoupled) temporal marginals, i.e. where observed particles are not tracked over time. Lavenant et al. arXiv:2102.09204 addressed this challenging problem under a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model with a gradient-driven drift in the observed space, introducing a minimum entropy estimator relative to the Wiener measure. Chizat et al. arXiv:2205.07146 then provided a practical grid-free mean-field Langevin (MFL) algorithm using Schr\"odinger bridges. Motivated by the overwhelming success of observable state space models in the traditional paired trajectory inference problem (e.g. target tracking), we extend the above framework to a class of latent SDEs in the form of observable state space models. In this setting, we use partial observations to infer trajectories in the latent space under a specified dynamics model (e.g. the constant velocity/acceleration models from target tracking). We introduce PO-MFL to solve this latent trajectory inference problem and provide theoretical guarantees by extending the results of arXiv:2102.09204 to the partially observed setting. We leverage the MFL framework of arXiv:2205.07146, yielding an algorithm based on entropic OT between dynamics-adjusted adjacent time marginals. Experiments validate the robustness of our method and the exponential convergence of the MFL dynamics, and demonstrate significant outperformance over the latent-free method of arXiv:2205.07146 in key scenarios.</p></details> | 32 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fast and Certifiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05846v2)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose semidefinite trajectory optimization (STROM), a framework that computes fast and certifiably optimal solutions for nonconvex trajectory optimization problems defined by polynomial objectives and constraints. STROM employs sparse second-order Lasserre's hierarchy to generate semidefinite program (SDP) relaxations of trajectory optimization. Different from existing tools (e.g., YALMIP and SOSTOOLS in Matlab), STROM generates chain-like multiple-block SDPs with only positive semidefinite (PSD) variables. Moreover, STROM does so two orders of magnitude faster. Underpinning STROM is cuADMM, the first ADMM-based SDP solver implemented in CUDA and runs in GPUs. cuADMM builds upon the symmetric Gauss-Seidel ADMM algorithm and leverages GPU parallelization to speedup solving sparse linear systems and projecting onto PSD cones. In five trajectory optimization problems (inverted pendulum, cart-pole, vehicle landing, flying robot, and car back-in), cuADMM computes optimal trajectories (with certified suboptimality below 1%) in minutes (when other solvers take hours or run out of memory) and seconds (when others take minutes). Further, when warmstarted by data-driven initialization in the inverted pendulum problem, cuADMM delivers real-time performance: providing certifiably optimal trajectories in 0.66 seconds despite the SDP has 49,500 variables and 47,351 constraints.</p></details> |  |

At the link level, pointing errors in FSO links can significantly impact capacity, making accurate modeling of these errors essential for both assessing and enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel model for FSO pointing errors in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that incorporates three-dimensional (3D) jitter, including roll, pitch, and yaw angle jittering. We derive a probability density function for the pointing error angle based on the relative position and posture of the UAV to the ground station. This model is then integrated into a trajectory optimization problem designed to maximize energy efficiency while meeting constraints on speed, acceleration, and elevation angle. Our proposed optimization method significantly improves energy efficiency by adjusting the UAV's flight trajectory to minimize exposure to directions highly affected by jitter. The simulation results emphasize the importance of using UAV-specific 3D jitter models in achieving accurate performance measurements and effective system optimization in FSO communication networks. Utilizing our generalized model, the optimized trajectories achieve up to 11.8 percent higher energy efficiency compared to those derived from conventional Gaussian pointing error models.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 12 figures, under revision; IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Vehicle Trajectory Planning at V2I-enabled Intersections based on Correlated Equilibrium](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05336v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating trajectories that ensure both vehicle safety and improve traffic efficiency remains a challenging task at intersections. Many existing works utilize Nash equilibrium (NE) for the trajectory planning at intersections. However, NE-based planning can hardly guarantee that all vehicles are in the same equilibrium, leading to a risk of collision. In this work, we propose a framework for trajectory planning based on Correlated Equilibrium (CE) when V2I communication is also enabled. The recommendation with CE allows all vehicles to reach a safe and consensual equilibrium and meanwhile keeps the rationality as NE-based methods that no vehicle has the incentive to deviate. The Intersection Manager (IM) first collects the trajectory library and the personal preference probabilities over the library from each vehicle in a low-resolution spatial-temporal grid map. Then, the IM optimizes the recommendation probability distribution for each vehicle's trajectory by minimizing overall collision probability under the CE constraint. Finally, each vehicle samples a trajectory of the low-resolution map to construct a safety corridor and derive a smooth trajectory with a local refinement optimization. We conduct comparative experiments at a crossroad intersection involving two and four vehicles, validating the effectiveness of our method in balancing vehicle safety and traffic efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages,12 figures,Submission to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Entry Generalized Search Trees for Indexing Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05327v1)** | 2024-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The idea of generalized indices is one of the success stories of database systems research. It has found its way to implementation in common database systems. GiST (Generalized Search Tree) and SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) are two widely-used generalized indices that are typically used for multidimensional data. Currently, the generalized indices GiST and SP-GiST represent one database object using one index entry, e.g., a bounding box for each spatio-temporal object. However, when dealing with complex objects, e.g., moving object trajectories, a single entry per object is inadequate for creating efficient indices. Previous research has highlighted that splitting trajectories into multiple bounding boxes prior to indexing can enhance query performance as it leads to a higher index filter. In this paper, we introduce MGiST and MSP-GiST, the multi-entry generalized search tree counterparts of GiST and SP-GiST, respectively, that are designed to enable the partitioning of objects into multiple entries during insertion. The methods for decomposing a complex object into multiple sub-objects differ from one data type to another, and may depend on some domain-specific parameters. Thus, MGiST and MSP-GiST are designed to allow for pluggable modules that aid in optimizing the split of an object into multiple sub-objects. We demonstrate the usefulness of MGiST and MSP-GiST using a trajectory indexing scenario, where we realize several trajectory indexes using MGiST and MSP-GiST and instantiate these search trees with trajectory-specific splitting algorithms. We create and test the performance of several multi-entry versions of widely-used spatial index structures, e.g., R-Tree, Quad-Tree, and KD-Tree. We conduct evaluations using both synthetic and real-world data, and observe up to an order of magnitude enhancement in performance of point, range, and KNN queries.</p></details> |  |

When the generalization error of the SDE approximation closely aligns with that of SGD in expectation, it provides two opportunities for understanding better the generalization behaviour of SGD through its SDE approximation. Firstly, viewing SGD as full-batch gradient descent with Gaussian gradient noise allows us to obtain trajectory-based generalization bound using the information-theoretic bound from Xu and Raginsky [2017]. Secondly, assuming mild conditions, we estimate the steady-state weight distribution of SDE and use information-theoretic bounds from Xu and Raginsky [2017] and Negrea et al. [2019] to establish terminal-state-based generalization bounds. Our proposed bounds have some advantages, notably the trajectory-based bound outperforms results in Wang and Mao [2022], and the terminal-state-based bound exhibits a fast decay rate comparable to stability-based bounds.</p></details> | Accepted by UAI 2024 |

While LSO excels in single-objective optimization, its multi-objective variants face challenges such as poor initialization, local optima entrapment, and so on. This study proposes Dynamic Multi-Objective Lion Swarm Optimization with Multi-strategy Fusion (MF-DMOLSO) to address these limitations. MF-DMOLSO comprises three key components: initialization, swarm position update, and external archive update. The initialization unit employs chaotic mapping for uniform population distribution. The position update unit enhances behavior patterns and step size formulas for cub lions, incorporating crowding degree sorting, Pareto non-dominated sorting, and Levy flight to improve convergence speed and global search capabilities. Reference points guide convergence in higher-dimensional spaces, maintaining population diversity. An adaptive cold-hot start strategy generates a population responsive to environmental changes. The external archive update unit re-evaluates solutions based on non-domination and diversity to form the new population. Evaluations on benchmark functions showed MF-DMOLSO surpassed multi-objective particle swarm optimization, non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II, and multi-objective lion swarm optimization, exceeding 90% accuracy for two-objective and 97% for three-objective problems. Compared to non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm III, MF-DMOLSO showed a 60% improvement. Applied to 6R robot trajectory planning, MF-DMOLSO optimized running time and maximum acceleration to 8.3s and 0.3pi rad/s^2, achieving a set coverage rate of 70.97% compared to 2% by multi-objective particle swarm optimization, thus improving efficiency and reducing mechanical dither.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resisting Stochastic Risks in Diffusion Planners with the Trajectory Aggregation Tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17879v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion planners have shown promise in handling long-horizon and sparse-reward tasks due to the non-autoregressive plan generation. However, their inherent stochastic risk of generating infeasible trajectories presents significant challenges to their reliability and stability. We introduce a novel approach, the Trajectory Aggregation Tree (TAT), to address this issue in diffusion planners. Compared to prior methods that rely solely on raw trajectory predictions, TAT aggregates information from both historical and current trajectories, forming a dynamic tree-like structure. Each trajectory is conceptualized as a branch and individual states as nodes. As the structure evolves with the integration of new trajectories, unreliable states are marginalized, and the most impactful nodes are prioritized for decision-making. TAT can be deployed without modifying the original training and sampling pipelines of diffusion planners, making it a training-free, ready-to-deploy solution. We provide both theoretical analysis and empirical evidence to support TAT's effectiveness. Our results highlight its remarkable ability to resist the risk from unreliable trajectories, guarantee the performance boosting of diffusion planners in $100\%$ of tasks, and exhibit an appreciable tolerance margin for sample quality, thereby enabling planning with a more than $3\times$ acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

This approach has gained traction due to its ability to bridge the gap between perception and planning that exists in traditional methods, thereby eliminating delays between modules. However, the practice of replacing original modules with neural networks in a black-box manner diminishes the overall system's robustness and stability. It lacks principled explanations and often fails to consistently generate high-quality motion trajectories. Furthermore, such methods often struggle to rigorously account for the robot's kinematic constraints, resulting in the generation of trajectories that cannot be executed satisfactorily. In this work, we combine the advantages of traditional methods and neural networks by proposing an optimization-embedded neural network. This network can learn high-quality trajectories directly from visual inputs without the need of mapping, while ensuring dynamic feasibility. Here, the deep neural network is employed to directly extract environment safety regions from depth images. Subsequently, we employ a model-based approach to represent these regions as safety constraints in trajectory optimization. Leveraging the availability of highly efficient optimization algorithms, our method robustly converges to feasible and optimal solutions that satisfy various user-defined constraints. Moreover, we differentiate the optimization process, allowing it to be trained as a layer within the neural network. This approach facilitates the direct interaction between perception and planning, enabling the network to focus more on the spatial regions where optimal solutions exist. As a result, it further enhances the quality and stability of the generated trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Some ...</summary><p>Some statements in the introduction may be controversial</p></details> |

To tackle the intrinsic sparsity issue of real-world user mobility traces, spatiotemporal contexts have been shown as significantly useful. Existing solutions mostly incorporate spatiotemporal distances between locations in mobility traces, either by feeding them as additional inputs to Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or by using them to search for informative past hidden states for prediction. However, such distance-based methods fail to capture the time-varying temporal regularities of human mobility, where human mobility is often more regular in the morning than in other periods, for example; this suggests the usefulness of the actual timestamps besides the temporal distances. Against this background, we propose REPLAY, a general RNN architecture learning to capture the time-varying temporal regularities for location prediction. Specifically, REPLAY not only resorts to the spatiotemporal distances in sparse trajectories to search for the informative past hidden states, but also accommodates the time-varying temporal regularities by incorporating smoothed timestamp embeddings using Gaussian weighted averaging with timestamp-specific learnable bandwidths, which can flexibly adapt to the temporal regularities of different strengths across different timestamps. Our extensive evaluation compares REPLAY against a sizable collection of state-of-the-art techniques on two real-world datasets. Results show that REPLAY consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 7.7\%-10.9\% in the location prediction task, and the bandwidths reveal interesting patterns of the time-varying temporal regularities.</p></details> |  |

However, the difficulty of collecting human demonstration data for complex tasks makes learning efficient representations of those trajectories challenging. For many problems, such as for dexterous manipulation, the exact timings of the trajectories should be factored from their spatial path characteristics. In this work, we propose TimewarpVAE, a fully differentiable manifold-learning algorithm that incorporates Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to simultaneously learn both timing variations and latent factors of spatial variation. We show how the TimewarpVAE algorithm learns appropriate time alignments and meaningful representations of spatial variations in handwriting and fork manipulation datasets. Our results have lower spatial reconstruction test error than baseline approaches and the learned low-dimensional representations can be used to efficiently generate semantically meaningful novel trajectories. We demonstrate the utility of our algorithm to generate novel high-speed trajectories for a robotic arm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Artif...</summary><p>Artificial Intelligence for Time Series Analysis (AI4TS): Theory, Algorithms, and Applications Workshop at IJCAI '24</p></details> |

Prior work overcomes this challenge by extracting useful knowledge from offline data, often accomplished through the learning of action distribution from offline data and utilizing the learned distribution to facilitate online RL. However, since the offline data are given and fixed, the extracted knowledge is inherently limited, making it difficult to generalize to new tasks. We propose a novel approach that leverages offline data to learn a generative diffusion model, coined as Adaptive Trajectory Diffuser (ATraDiff). This model generates synthetic trajectories, serving as a form of data augmentation and consequently enhancing the performance of online RL methods. The key strength of our diffuser lies in its adaptability, allowing it to effectively handle varying trajectory lengths and mitigate distribution shifts between online and offline data. Because of its simplicity, ATraDiff seamlessly integrates with a wide spectrum of RL methods. Empirical evaluation shows that ATraDiff consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across a variety of environments, with particularly pronounced improvements in complicated settings.

Despite increasing interest, recent works face challenges in achieving aesthetically appealing choreography, primarily for two key issues: multi-dancer collision and single-dancer foot slide. To address these issues, we propose a Trajectory-Controllable Diffusion (TCDiff), a novel approach that harnesses non-overlapping trajectories to facilitate coherent dance movements. Specifically, to tackle dancer collisions, we introduce a Dance-Beat Navigator capable of generating trajectories for multiple dancers based on the music, complemented by a Distance-Consistency loss to maintain appropriate spacing among trajectories within a reasonable threshold. To mitigate foot sliding, we present a Footwork Adaptor that utilizes trajectory displacement from adjacent frames to enable flexible footwork, coupled with a Relative Forward-Kinematic loss to adjust the positioning of individual dancers' root nodes and joints.

In this work, we address the task as the problem of inferring dense, long-range motion of 3D points. By observing a set of point trajectories, we aim to learn an implicit motion field parameterized by a neural network to predict the movement of novel points within the same domain, without relying on any data-driven or scene-specific priors. To achieve this, our approach builds upon the recently introduced dynamic point field model that learns smooth deformation fields between the canonical frame and individual observation frames. However, temporal consistency between consecutive frames is neglected, and the number of required parameters increases linearly with the sequence length due to per-frame modeling. To address these shortcomings, we exploit the intrinsic regularization provided by SIREN, and modify the input layer to produce a spatiotemporally smooth motion field. Additionally, we analyze the motion field Jacobian matrix, and discover that the motion degrees of freedom (DOFs) in an infinitesimal area around a point and the network hidden variables have different behaviors to affect the model's representational power. This enables us to improve the model representation capability while retaining the model compactness. Furthermore, to reduce the risk of overfitting, we introduce a regularization term based on the assumption of piece-wise motion smoothness. Our experiments assess the model's performance in predicting unseen point trajectories and its application in temporal mesh alignment with guidance. The results demonstrate its superiority and effectiveness.

In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

The multi-rotor will operate in the presence of external disturbances and modeling errors. At the same time, the reference trajectory is unknown and generated from a reference system with unknown or partially known dynamics. We assume the only measurements that are available are the position and orientation of the multi-rotor and the position of the reference system. We adopt an extended high-gain observer (EHGO) estimation framework to estimate the unmeasured multi-rotor states, modeling errors, external disturbances, and the reference trajectory. We design a robust output feedback controller for trajectory tracking that comprises a feedback linearizing controller and the EHGO. The proposed control method is rigorously analyzed to establish its stability properties. Finally, we illustrate our theoretical results through numerical simulation and experimental validation in which a multi-rotor tracks a moving ground vehicle with an unknown trajectory and dynamics and successfully lands on the vehicle while in motion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASME Journal of Dynamic Systems, Measurement and Control.

| **[Improved context-sensitive transformer model for inland vessel trajectory prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02771v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Physics-related and model-based vessel trajectory prediction is highly accurate but requires specific knowledge of the vessel under consideration which is not always practical. Machine learning-based trajectory prediction models do not require expert knowledge, but rely on the implicit knowledge extracted from massive amounts of data. Several deep learning (DL) methods for vessel trajectory prediction have recently been suggested. The DL models developed typically only process information about the (dis)location of vessels defined with respect to a global reference system. In the context of inland navigation, this can be problematic, since without knowledge of the limited navigable space, irrealistic trajectories are likely to be determined. If spatial constraintes are introduced, e.g., by implementing an additional submodule to process map data, however, overall complexity increases. Instead of processing the vessel displacement information on the one hand and the spatial information on the other hand, the paper proposes the merging of both information. Here, fairway-related and navigation-related displacement information are used directly. In this way, the previously proposed context-sensitive Classification Transformer (CSCT) shows an improved spatial awareness. Additionally, the CSCT is adapted to assess the model uncertainty by enabling dropout during inference. This approach is trained on different inland waterways to analyze its generalizability. As the improved CSCT obtains lower prediction errors and enables to estimate the trustworthiness of each prediction, it is more suitable for safety-critical applications in inland navigation than previously developed models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Short-term Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction with Encoder-Decoder Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02770v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate vessel trajectory prediction is necessary for save and efficient navigation. Deep learning-based prediction models, esp. encoder-decoders, are rarely applied to inland navigation specifically. Approaches from the maritime domain cannot directly be transferred to river navigation due to specific driving behavior influencing factors. Different encoder-decoder architectures, including a transformer encoder-decoder, are compared herein for predicting the next positions of inland vessels, given not only spatio-temporal information from AIS, but also river specific features. The results show that the reformulation of the regression task as classification problem and the inclusion of river specific features yield the lowest displacement errors. The standard LSTM encoder-decoder outperforms the transformer encoder-decoder for the data considered, but is computationally more expensive. In this study for the first time a transformer-based encoder-decoder model is applied to the problem of predicting the ship trajectory. Here, a feature vector using the river-specific context of navigation input parameters is established. Future studies can built on the proposed models, investigate the improvement of the computationally more efficient transformer, e.g. through further hyper-parameter optimization, and use additional river-specific information in the context representation to further increase prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial and social situation-aware transformer-based trajectory prediction of autonomous systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02767v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous transportation systems such as road vehicles or vessels require the consideration of the static and dynamic environment to dislocate without collision. Anticipating the behavior of an agent in a given situation is required to adequately react to it in time. Developing deep learning-based models has become the dominant approach to motion prediction recently. The social environment is often considered through a CNN-LSTM-based sub-module processing a $\textit{social tensor}$ that includes information of the past trajectory of surrounding agents. For the proposed transformer-based trajectory prediction model, an alternative, computationally more efficient social tensor definition and processing is suggested. It considers the interdependencies between target and surrounding agents at each time step directly instead of relying on information of last hidden LSTM states of individually processed agents. A transformer-based sub-module, the Social Tensor Transformer, is integrated into the overall prediction model. It is responsible for enriching the target agent's dislocation features with social interaction information obtained from the social tensor. For the awareness of spatial limitations, dislocation features are defined in relation to the navigable area. This replaces additional, computationally expensive map processing sub-modules. An ablation study shows, that for longer prediction horizons, the deviation of the predicted trajectory from the ground truth is lower compared to a spatially and socially agnostic model. Even if the performance gain from a spatial-only to a spatial and social context-sensitive model is small in terms of common error measures, by visualizing the results it can be shown that the proposed model in fact is able to predict reactions to surrounding agents and explicitely allows an interpretable behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Emotional Trajectories in Written Stories Utilizing Transformers and Weakly-Supervised Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02251v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Telling stories is an integral part of human communication which can evoke emotions and influence the affective states of the audience. Automatically modeling emotional trajectories in stories has thus attracted considerable scholarly interest. However, as most existing works have been limited to unsupervised dictionary-based approaches, there is no benchmark for this task. We address this gap by introducing continuous valence and arousal labels for an existing dataset of children's stories originally annotated with discrete emotion categories. We collect additional annotations for this data and map the categorical labels to the continuous valence and arousal space. For predicting the thus obtained emotionality signals, we fine-tune a DeBERTa model and improve upon this baseline via a weakly supervised learning approach. The best configuration achieves a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of $.8221$ for valence and $.7125$ for arousal on the test set, demonstrating the efficacy of our proposed approach. A detailed analysis shows the extent to which the results vary depending on factors such as the author, the individual story, or the section within the story. In addition, we uncover the weaknesses of our approach by investigating examples that prove to be difficult to predict.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2024 Findings. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2212.11382</p></details> |

The fundamental goal of MLR is to learn the regression models from unlabeled observations. The EM algorithm finds extensive applications in solving the mixture of linear regressions. Recent results have established the super-linear convergence of EM for 2MLR in the noiseless and high SNR settings under some assumptions and its global convergence rate with random initialization has been affirmed. However, the exponent of convergence has not been theoretically estimated and the geometric properties of the trajectory of EM iterations are not well-understood. In this paper, first, using Bessel functions we provide explicit closed-form expressions for the EM updates under all SNR regimes. Then, in the noiseless setting, we completely characterize the behavior of EM iterations by deriving a recurrence relation at the population level and notably show that all the iterations lie on a certain cycloid. Based on this new trajectory-based analysis, we exhibit the theoretical estimate for the exponent of super-linear convergence and further improve the statistical error bound at the finite-sample level. Our analysis provides a new framework for studying the behavior of EM for Mixed Linear Regression.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024).

First, we use the blocking technique to show that RCPS attains performance guarantees similar to those enjoyed in the iid setting whenever data is generated by asymptotically stationary and contractive dynamics. Next, we use the decoupling technique to characterize the graceful degradation in RCPS guarantees when the data generating process deviates from stationarity and contractivity. We conclude by discussing how these tools could be used toward a unified analysis of online and offline conformal prediction algorithms, which are currently treated with very different tools.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, current MLLMs are surprisingly poor at understanding webpage screenshots and generating their corresponding HTML code. To address this problem, we propose Web2Code, a benchmark consisting of a new large-scale webpage-to-code dataset for instruction tuning and an evaluation framework for the webpage understanding and HTML code translation abilities of MLLMs. For dataset construction, we leverage pretrained LLMs to enhance existing webpage-to-code datasets as well as generate a diverse pool of new webpages rendered into images. Specifically, the inputs are webpage images and instructions, while the responses are the webpage's HTML code. We further include diverse natural language QA pairs about the webpage content in the responses to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the web content. To evaluate model performance in these tasks, we develop an evaluation framework for testing MLLMs' abilities in webpage understanding and web-to-code generation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed dataset is beneficial not only to our proposed tasks but also in the general visual domain, while previous datasets result in worse performance. We hope our work will contribute to the development of general MLLMs suitable for web-based content generation and task automation. Our data and code will be available at https://github.com/MBZUAI-LLM/web2code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website at https://mbzuai-llm.github.io/webpage2code/</p></details> |

Traditional approaches, including safety-specific fine-tuning or adversarial testing, often yield safe outputs at the expense of contextual meaning. This can result in a diminished capacity to handle nuanced aspects of bias and toxicity, such as underrepresentation or negative portrayals across various demographics. To address these challenges, we introduce MBIAS, an LLM framework carefully instruction fine-tuned on a custom dataset designed specifically for safety interventions. MBIAS is designed to significantly reduce biases and toxic elements in LLM outputs while preserving the main information. This work also details our further use of LLMs: as annotator under human supervision and as evaluator of generated content. Empirical analysis reveals that MBIAS achieves a reduction in bias and toxicity by over 30\% in standard evaluations, and by more than 90\% in diverse demographic tests, highlighting the robustness of our approach. We make the dataset and the fine-tuned model available to the research community for further investigation and ensure reproducibility. The code for this project can be accessed here https://github.com/shainarazavi/MBIAS/tree/main. Warning: This paper contains examples that may be offensive or upsetting.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEMoE: Advanced Mixture of Experts Adaptor for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20030v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) require continual knowledge updates to stay abreast of the ever-changing world facts, prompting the formulation of lifelong model editing task. While recent years have witnessed the development of various techniques for single and batch editing, these methods either fail to apply or perform sub-optimally when faced with lifelong editing. In this paper, we introduce LEMoE, an advanced Mixture of Experts (MoE) adaptor for lifelong model editing. We first analyze the factors influencing the effectiveness of conventional MoE adaptor in lifelong editing, including catastrophic forgetting, inconsistent routing and order sensitivity. Based on these insights, we propose a tailored module insertion method to achieve lifelong editing, incorporating a novel KV anchor routing to enhance routing consistency between training and inference stage, along with a concise yet effective clustering-based editing order planning. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in lifelong editing, surpassing previous model editing techniques while maintaining outstanding performance in batch editing task. Our code will be available.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolBeHonest: A Multi-level Hallucination Diagnostic Benchmark for Tool-Augmented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.20015v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into real-world applications. Due to the lack of benchmarks, the community still needs to fully understand the hallucination issues within these models. To address this challenge, we introduce a comprehensive diagnostic benchmark, ToolBH. Specifically, we assess the LLM's hallucinations through two perspectives: depth and breadth. In terms of depth, we propose a multi-level diagnostic process, including (1) solvability detection, (2) solution planning, and (3) missing-tool analysis. For breadth, we consider three scenarios based on the characteristics of the toolset: missing necessary tools, potential tools, and limited functionality tools. Furthermore, we developed seven tasks and collected 700 evaluation samples through multiple rounds of manual annotation. The results show the significant challenges presented by the ToolBH benchmark. The current advanced models Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o only achieve a total score of 45.3 and 37.0, respectively, on a scale of 100. In this benchmark, larger model parameters do not guarantee better performance; the training data and response strategies also play a crucial role in tool-enhanced LLM scenarios. Our diagnostic analysis indicates that the primary reason for model errors lies in assessing task solvability. Additionally, open-weight models suffer from performance drops with verbose replies, whereas proprietary models excel with longer reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Speculative Inference of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14105v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accelerating the inference of large language models (LLMs) is an important challenge in artificial intelligence. This paper introduces distributed speculative inference (DSI), a novel distributed inference algorithm that is provably faster than speculative inference (SI) [leviathan2023fast, chen2023accelerating, miao2023specinfer] and traditional autoregressive inference (non-SI). Like other SI algorithms, DSI works on frozen LLMs, requiring no training or architectural modifications, and it preserves the target distribution. Prior studies on SI have demonstrated empirical speedups (compared to non-SI) but require a fast and accurate drafter LLM. In practice, off-the-shelf LLMs often do not have matching drafters that are sufficiently fast and accurate. We show a gap: SI gets slower than non-SI when using slower or less accurate drafters. We close this gap by proving that DSI is faster than both SI and non-SI given any drafters. By orchestrating multiple instances of the target and drafters, DSI is not only faster than SI but also supports LLMs that cannot be accelerated with SI. Our simulations show speedups of off-the-shelf LLMs in realistic settings: DSI is 1.29-1.92x faster than SI.</p></details> |  |
| **[The SIFo Benchmark: Investigating the Sequential Instruction Following Ability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19999v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following multiple instructions is a crucial ability for large language models (LLMs). Evaluating this ability comes with significant challenges: (i) limited coherence between multiple instructions, (ii) positional bias where the order of instructions affects model performance, and (iii) a lack of objectively verifiable tasks. To address these issues, we introduce a benchmark designed to evaluate models' abilities to follow multiple instructions through sequential instruction following (SIFo) tasks. In SIFo, the successful completion of multiple instructions is verifiable by examining only the final instruction. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following using four tasks (text modification, question answering, mathematics, and security rule following), each assessing different aspects of sequential instruction following. Our evaluation of popular LLMs, both closed-source and open-source, shows that more recent and larger models significantly outperform their older and smaller counterparts on the SIFo tasks, validating the benchmark's effectiveness. All models struggle with following sequences of instructions, hinting at an important lack of robustness of today's language models.</p></details> |  |

However, the advancement of medical image understanding and reasoning critically depends on building high-quality visual instruction data, which is costly and labor-intensive to obtain, particularly in the medical domain. To mitigate this data-starving issue, we introduce Self-Training Large Language and Vision Assistant for Medical (STLLaVA-Med). The proposed method is designed to train a policy model (an LVLM) capable of auto-generating medical visual instruction data to improve data efficiency, guided through Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Specifically, a more powerful and larger LVLM (e.g., GPT-4o) is involved as a biomedical expert to oversee the DPO fine-tuning process on the auto-generated data, encouraging the policy model to align efficiently with human preferences. We validate the efficacy and data efficiency of STLLaVA-Med across three major medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks, demonstrating competitive zero-shot performance with the utilization of only 9% of the medical data.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, human behavior is often not entirely rational and is challenging to predict accurately with mathematical models. In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}gent-based \textbf{S}imulated \textbf{F}inancial \textbf{M}arket (ASFM), which first constructs a simulated stock market with a real order matching system. Then, we propose a large language model based agent as the stock trader, which contains the profile, observation, and tool-learning based action module. The trading agent can comprehensively understand current market dynamics and financial policy information, and make decisions that align with their trading strategy. In the experiments, we first verify that the reactions of our ASFM are consistent with the real stock market in two controllable scenarios. In addition, we also conduct experiments in two popular economics research directions, and we find that conclusions drawn in our \model align with the preliminary findings in economics research. Based on these observations, we believe our proposed ASFM provides a new paradigm for economic research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Token Gradient Conflict in Mixture-of-Experts for Large Vision-Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19905v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing attention in the study of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). It uses a sparse model to replace the dense model, achieving comparable performance while activating fewer parameters during inference, thus significantly reducing the inference cost. Existing MoE methods in LVLMs encourage different experts to handle different tokens, and thus they employ a router to predict the routing for each token. However, the predictions are based solely on sample features and do not truly reveal the optimization direction of tokens. This can lead to severe optimization conflicts between different tokens within an expert. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel method based on token-level gradient analysis. Specifically, we first use token-level gradients to identify conflicting tokens in experts. Then, we add a specialized loss tailored to eliminate conflicts among tokens within each expert. Our method can serve as a plug-in for diverse Large Vision-Language Models, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The code will be publicly available at https://github.com/longrongyang/STGC.</p></details> |  |

Despite the increasing importance of long-form video content, existing benchmarks primarily focus on shorter clips. To address this gap, we introduce InfiniBench a comprehensive benchmark for very long video understanding which presents 1)The longest video duration, averaging 76.34 minutes; 2) The largest number of question-answer pairs, 108.2K; 3) Diversity in questions that examine nine different skills and include both multiple-choice questions and open-ended questions; 4) Humancentric, as the video sources come from movies and daily TV shows, with specific human-level question designs such as Movie Spoiler Questions that require critical thinking and comprehensive understanding. Using InfiniBench, we comprehensively evaluate existing Large MultiModality Models (LMMs) on each skill, including the commercial model Gemini 1.5 Flash and the open-source models. The evaluation shows significant challenges in our benchmark.Our results show that the best AI models such Gemini struggles to perform well with 42.72% average accuracy and 2.71 out of 5 average score. We hope this benchmark will stimulate the LMMs community towards long video and human-level understanding.

While many open-source LLMs have been released with technical reports, the lack of training details hinders further research and development. This paper presents the development of YuLan, a series of open-source LLMs with $12$ billion parameters. The base model of YuLan is pre-trained on approximately $1.7$T tokens derived from a diverse corpus, including massive English, Chinese, and multilingual texts. We design a three-stage pre-training method to enhance YuLan's overall capabilities. Subsequent phases of training incorporate instruction-tuning and human alignment, employing a substantial volume of high-quality synthesized data. To facilitate the learning of complex and long-tail knowledge, we devise a curriculum-learning framework throughout across these stages, which helps LLMs learn knowledge in an easy-to-hard manner. YuLan's training is finished on Jan, 2024 and has achieved performance on par with state-of-the-art LLMs across various English and Chinese benchmarks. This paper outlines a comprehensive technical roadmap for developing LLMs from scratch. Our model and codes are available at https://github.com/RUC-GSAI/YuLan-Chat.</p></details> |  |

Previous studies typically focus on specific aspects of time, lacking a comprehensive temporal reasoning benchmark. To address this, we propose TimeBench, a comprehensive hierarchical temporal reasoning benchmark that covers a broad spectrum of temporal reasoning phenomena. TimeBench provides a thorough evaluation for investigating the temporal reasoning capabilities of large language models.

Our experimental results indicate a significant performance gap between the state-of-the-art LLMs and humans, highlighting that there is still a considerable distance to cover in temporal reasoning. Besides, LLMs exhibit capability discrepancies across different reasoning categories. Furthermore, we thoroughly analyze the impact of multiple aspects on temporal reasoning and emphasize the associated challenges. We aspire for TimeBench to serve as a comprehensive benchmark, fostering research in temporal reasoning.

We first build a general tool to characterize the upper bound and the minimax lower bound of kernel regression for large dimensional data through the Mendelson complexity $\varepsilon_{n}^{2}$ and the metric entropy $\bar{\varepsilon}_{n}^{2}$ respectively. When the target function falls into the RKHS associated with a (general) inner product model defined on $\mathbb{S}^{d}$, we utilize the new tool to show that the minimax rate of the excess risk of kernel regression is $n^{-1/2}$ when $n\asymp d^{\gamma}$ for $\gamma =2, 4, 6, 8, \cdots$. We then further determine the optimal rate of the excess risk of kernel regression for all the $\gamma>0$ and find that the curve of optimal rate varying along $\gamma$ exhibits several new phenomena including the multiple descent behavior and the periodic plateau behavior. As an application, For the neural tangent kernel (NTK), we also provide a similar explicit description of the curve of optimal rate. As a direct corollary, we know these claims hold for wide neural networks as well.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present a mobile robot oriented large-scale indoor dataset, denoted as THUD (Tsinghua University Dynamic) robotic dataset, for training and evaluating their dynamic scene understanding algorithms. Specifically, the THUD dataset construction is first detailed, including organization, acquisition, and annotation methods. It comprises both real-world and synthetic data, collected with a real robot platform and a physical simulation platform, respectively. Our current dataset includes 13 larges-scale dynamic scenarios, 90K image frames, 20M 2D/3D bounding boxes of static and dynamic objects, camera poses, and IMU. The dataset is still continuously expanding. Then, the performance of mainstream indoor scene understanding tasks, e.g. 3D object detection, semantic segmentation, and robot relocalization, is evaluated on our THUD dataset. These experiments reveal serious challenges for some robot scene understanding tasks in dynamic scenes. By sharing this dataset, we aim to foster and iterate new mobile robot algorithms quickly for robot actual working dynamic environment, i.e. complex crowded dynamic scenes.</p></details> |  |

Existing traffic simulation systems encounter two significant limitations. Firstly, they often rely on open-source datasets or manually crafted maps, constraining the scale of simulations. Secondly, vehicle models within these systems tend to be either oversimplified or lack controllability, compromising the authenticity and diversity of the simulations. In this paper, we propose LCSim, a large-scale controllable traffic simulator. LCSim provides map tools for constructing unified high-definition map (HD map) descriptions from open-source datasets including Waymo and Argoverse or publicly available data sources like OpenStreetMap to scale up the simulation scenarios. Also, we integrate diffusion-based traffic simulation into the simulator for realistic and controllable microscopic traffic flow modeling. By leveraging these features, LCSim provides realistic and diverse virtual traffic environments.

However, existing KD methods face limitations and challenges in distillation of LLMs, including efficiency and insufficient measurement capabilities of traditional KL divergence. It is shown that LLMs can serve as an implicit reward function, which we define as a supplement to KL divergence. In this work, we propose Direct Preference Knowledge Distillation (DPKD) for LLMs. DPKD utilizes distribution divergence to represent the preference loss and implicit reward function. We re-formulate KD of LLMs into two stages: first optimizing and objective consisting of implicit reward and reverse KL divergence and then improving the preference probability of teacher outputs over student outputs. We conducted experiments and analysis on various datasets with LLM parameters ranging from 120M to 13B and demonstrate the broad applicability and effectiveness of our DPKD approach.

| **[Large Language Model Enhanced Clustering for News Event Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10552v3)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The news landscape is continuously evolving, with an ever-increasing volume of information from around the world. Automated event detection within this vast data repository is essential for monitoring, identifying, and categorizing significant news occurrences across diverse platforms. This paper presents an event detection framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with clustering analysis to detect news events from the Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT). The framework enhances event clustering through both pre-event detection tasks (keyword extraction and text embedding) and post-event detection tasks (event summarization and topic labelling). We also evaluate the impact of various textual embeddings on the quality of clustering outcomes, ensuring robust news categorization. Additionally, we introduce a novel Cluster Stability Assessment Index (CSAI) to assess the validity and robustness of clustering results. CSAI utilizes multiple feature vectors to provide a new way of measuring clustering quality. Our experiments indicate that the use of LLM embedding in the event detection framework has significantly improved the results, demonstrating greater robustness in terms of CSAI scores. Moreover, post-event detection tasks generate meaningful insights, facilitating effective interpretation of event clustering results. Overall, our experimental results indicate that the proposed framework offers valuable insights and could enhance the accuracy in news analysis and reporting.</p></details> |  |

Software design, being one, has gained tremendous benefits in using LLMs as an interface component that extends fixed user stories. However, inclusion of LLM-based AI agents in software design often poses unexpected challenges, especially in the estimation of development efforts. Through the example of UI-based user stories, we provide a comparison against traditional methods and propose a new way to enhance specifications of natural language-based questions that allows for the estimation of development effort by taking into account data sources, interfaces and algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Successful echocardiography requires a thorough understanding of the structures on the two-dimensional plane and the spatial relationships between planes in three-dimensional space. In this paper, we innovatively propose a large-scale self-supervised pre-training method to acquire a cardiac structure-aware world model. The core innovation lies in constructing a self-supervised task that requires structural inference by predicting masked structures on a 2D plane and imagining another plane based on pose transformation in 3D space. To support large-scale pre-training, we collected over 1.36 million echocardiograms from ten standard views, along with their 3D spatial poses. In the downstream probe guidance task, we demonstrate that our pre-trained model consistently reduces guidance errors across the ten most common standard views on the test set with 0.29 million samples from 74 routine clinical scans, indicating that structure-aware pre-training benefits the scanning.</p></details> | Technical report |

While existing visual instruction datasets often focus on question-answering, they struggle to generalize to broader application scenarios such as creative writing, summarization, or image analysis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach to constructing MM-Instruct that leverages the strong instruction-following capabilities of existing LLMs to generate novel visual instruction data from large-scale but conventional image captioning datasets. MM-Instruct first leverages ChatGPT to automatically generate diverse instructions from a small set of seed instructions through augmenting and summarization. It then matches these instructions with images and uses an open-sourced large language model (LLM) to generate coherent answers to the instruction-image pairs. The LLM is grounded by the detailed text descriptions of images in the whole answer generation process to guarantee the alignment of the instruction data. Moreover, we introduce a benchmark based on the generated instruction data to evaluate the instruction-following capabilities of existing LMMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of MM-Instruct by training a LLaVA-1.5 model on the generated data, denoted as LLaVA-Instruct, which exhibits significant improvements in instruction-following capabilities compared to LLaVA-1.5 models. The MM-Instruct dataset, benchmark, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jihaonew/MM-Instruct.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset and models are available at https://github.com/jihaonew/MM-Instruct</p></details> |

To systematically examine the reasoning capabilities required for solving complex scientific problems, we introduce an expansive benchmark suite SciBench for LLMs. SciBench contains a carefully curated dataset featuring a range of collegiate-level scientific problems from mathematics, chemistry, and physics domains. Based on the dataset, we conduct an in-depth benchmarking study of representative open-source and proprietary LLMs with various prompting strategies. The results reveal that the current LLMs fall short of delivering satisfactory performance, with the best overall score of merely 43.22%. Furthermore, through a detailed user study, we categorize the errors made by LLMs into ten problem-solving abilities. Our analysis indicates that no single prompting strategy significantly outperforms the others and some strategies that demonstrate improvements in certain problem-solving skills could result in declines in other skills. We envision that SciBench will catalyze further developments in the reasoning abilities of LLMs, thereby ultimately contributing to scientific research and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Active Preference Learning for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08114v2)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become more capable, fine-tuning techniques for aligning with human intent are increasingly important. A key consideration for aligning these models is how to most effectively use human resources, or model resources in the case where LLMs themselves are used as oracles. Reinforcement learning from Human or AI preferences (RLHF/RLAIF) is the most prominent example of such a technique, but is complex and often unstable. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently been proposed as a simpler and more stable alternative. In this work, we develop an active learning strategy for DPO to make better use of preference labels. We propose a practical acquisition function for prompt/completion pairs based on the predictive entropy of the language model and a measure of certainty of the implicit preference model optimized by DPO. We demonstrate how our approach improves both the rate of learning and final performance of fine-tuning on pairwise preference data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Despite this, challenges remain in the areas of generalization, controllability, diversity, and truthfulness within the existing generative frameworks. To address these challenges, this paper presents UniGen, a comprehensive LLM-powered framework designed to produce diverse, accurate, and highly controllable datasets. UniGen is adaptable, supporting all types of text datasets and enhancing the generative process through innovative mechanisms. To augment data diversity, UniGen incorporates an attribute-guided generation module and a group checking feature. For accuracy, it employs a code-based mathematical assessment for label verification alongside a retrieval-augmented generation technique for factual validation. The framework also allows for user-specified constraints, enabling customization of the data generation process to suit particular requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior quality of data generated by UniGen, and each module within UniGen plays a critical role in this enhancement. Additionally, UniGen is applied in two practical scenarios: benchmarking LLMs and data augmentation. The results indicate that UniGen effectively supports dynamic and evolving benchmarking, and that data augmentation improves LLM capabilities in various domains, including agent-oriented abilities and reasoning skills.</p></details> |  |

Although popular techniques like W8A8 and W4A16 effectively maintain model performance, they often fail to concurrently speed up the prefill and decoding stages of inference. W4A8 is a promising strategy to accelerate both of them while usually leads to a significant performance degradation. To address these issues, we present QQQ, a Quality Quattuor-bit Quantization method with 4-bit weights and 8-bit activations. QQQ employs adaptive smoothing and Hessian-based compensation, significantly enhancing the performance of quantized models without extensive training. Furthermore, we meticulously engineer W4A8 GEMM kernels to increase inference speed. Our specialized per-channel W4A8 GEMM and per-group W4A8 GEMM achieve impressive speed increases of 3.67$\times$ and 3.29 $\times$ over FP16 GEMM. Our extensive experiments show that QQQ achieves performance on par with existing state-of-the-art LLM quantization methods while significantly accelerating inference, achieving speed boosts up to 2.24 $\times$, 2.10$\times$, and 1.25$\times$ compared to FP16, W8A8, and W4A16, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification in Large Language Models Through Convex Hull Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19712v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty quantification approaches have been more critical in large language models (LLMs), particularly high-risk applications requiring reliable outputs. However, traditional methods for uncertainty quantification, such as probabilistic models and ensemble techniques, face challenges when applied to the complex and high-dimensional nature of LLM-generated outputs. This study proposes a novel geometric approach to uncertainty quantification using convex hull analysis. The proposed method leverages the spatial properties of response embeddings to measure the dispersion and variability of model outputs. The prompts are categorized into three types, i.e., `easy', `moderate', and `confusing', to generate multiple responses using different LLMs at varying temperature settings. The responses are transformed into high-dimensional embeddings via a BERT model and subsequently projected into a two-dimensional space using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is utilized to cluster the embeddings and compute the convex hull for each selected cluster. The experimental results indicate that the uncertainty of the model for LLMs depends on the prompt complexity, the model, and the temperature setting.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[InfiniGen: Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models with Dynamic KV Cache Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19707v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive performance across various natural language processing tasks. Serving LLM inference for generating long contents, however, poses a challenge due to the enormous memory footprint of the transient state, known as the key-value (KV) cache, which scales with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we present InfiniGen, a novel KV cache management framework tailored for long-text generation, which synergistically works with modern offloading-based inference systems. InfiniGen leverages the key insight that a few important tokens that are essential for computing the subsequent attention layer in the Transformer can be speculated by performing a minimal rehearsal with the inputs of the current layer and part of the query weight and key cache of the subsequent layer. This allows us to prefetch only the essential KV cache entries (without fetching them all), thereby mitigating the fetch overhead from the host memory in offloading-based LLM serving systems. Our evaluation on several representative LLMs shows that InfiniGen improves the overall performance of a modern offloading-based system by up to 3.00x compared to prior KV cache management methods while offering substantially better model accuracy.</p></details> | OSDI 2024 |

Despite significant advancements made by recent neural solvers, their limited expressiveness does not conform well to the multi-modal nature of CO landscapes. While some research has pivoted towards diffusion models, they require simulating a Markov chain with many steps to produce a sample, which is time-consuming and does not meet the efficiency requirement of real applications, especially at scale. We propose DISCO, an efficient DIffusion Solver for Combinatorial Optimization problems that excels in both solution quality and inference speed. DISCO's efficacy is two-pronged: Firstly, it achieves rapid denoising of solutions through an analytically solvable form, allowing for direct sampling from the solution space with very few reverse-time steps, thereby drastically reducing inference time. Secondly, DISCO enhances solution quality by restricting the sampling space to a more constrained, meaningful domain guided by solution residues, while still preserving the inherent multi-modality of the output probabilistic distributions. DISCO achieves state-of-the-art results on very large Traveling Salesman Problems with 10000 nodes and challenging Maximal Independent Set benchmarks, with its per-instance denoising time up to 44.8 times faster. Through further combining a divide-and-conquer strategy, DISCO can be generalized to solve arbitrary-scale problem instances off the shelf, even outperforming models trained specifically on corresponding scales.</p></details> |  |

Object hallucination refers to the phenomenon that the LVLMs claim non-existent objects in the image. To mitigate the object hallucinations, instruction tuning and external model-based detection methods have been proposed, which either require large-scare computational resources or depend on the detection result of external models. However, there remains an under-explored field to utilize the LVLM itself to alleviate object hallucinations. In this work, we adopt the intuition that the LVLM tends to respond logically consistently for existent objects but inconsistently for hallucinated objects. Therefore, we propose a Logical Closed Loop-based framework for Object Hallucination Detection and Mitigation, namely LogicCheckGPT. In specific, we devise logical consistency probing to raise questions with logical correlations, inquiring about attributes from objects and vice versa. Whether their responses can form a logical closed loop serves as an indicator of object hallucination. As a plug-and-play method, it can be seamlessly applied to all existing LVLMs. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three benchmarks across four LVLMs have demonstrated significant improvements brought by our method, indicating its effectiveness and generality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept to ACL 2024; 19 Pages, 15 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

These models make predictions that fall into a limited number of predefined classes, facilitating a binary true or false evaluation and enabling the direct calculation of metrics such as the F1 score. However, recent advancements in generative large language models (GLLMs) have prompted a shift in the field due to their enhanced zero-shot capabilities, which eliminate the need for a downstream dataset and computationally expensive fine-tuning. However, evaluating GLLMs presents a challenge as the binary true or false evaluation used for discriminative models is not applicable to the predictions made by GLLMs. This paper introduces a new metric for generative models called ANLS* for evaluating a wide variety of tasks, including information extraction and classification tasks. The ANLS* metric extends existing ANLS metrics as a drop-in-replacement and is still compatible with previously reported ANLS scores. An evaluation of 7 different datasets, and more than 10 different GLLMs together with 3 different prompting methods using the ANLS* metric is also provided, demonstrating the importance of the proposed metric. We also benchmark a novel approach to generate prompts for documents, called SFT, against other prompting techniques such as LATIN. In 6 out of 7 cases, SFT outperforms other techniques and improves the state-of-the-art, sometimes by as much as $10$ percentage points.

However, the biomedical field currently exhibits a substantial gap in this area, primarily due to the absence of a dedicated refer and ground dataset for biomedical images. To address this challenge, we devised the Med-GRIT-270k dataset. It comprises 270k question-and-answer pairs and spans eight distinct medical imaging modalities. Most importantly, it is the first dedicated to the biomedical domain and integrating refer and ground conversations. The key idea is to sample large-scale biomedical image-mask pairs from medical segmentation datasets and generate instruction datasets from text using chatGPT. Additionally, we introduce a Refer-and-Ground Multimodal Large Language Model for Biomedicine (BiRD) by using this dataset and multi-task instruction learning. Extensive experiments have corroborated the efficacy of the Med-GRIT-270k dataset and the multi-modal, fine-grained interactive capabilities of the BiRD model.

We describe the practicalities and challenges of developing and deploying GRILLBot, a leading (first and second prize winning in 2022 and 2023) system deployed in the Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge. Building on our Open Assistant Toolkit (OAT) framework, we propose a hybrid architecture that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and specialised models tuned for specific subtasks requiring very low latency. OAT allows us to define when, how and which LLMs should be used in a structured and deployable manner. For knowledge-grounded question answering and live task adaptations, we show that LLM reasoning abilities over task context and world knowledge outweigh latency concerns. For dialogue state management, we implement a code generation approach and show that specialised smaller models have 84% effectiveness with 100x lower latency. Overall, we provide insights and discuss tradeoffs for deploying both traditional models and LLMs to users in complex real-world multimodal environments in the Alexa TaskBot challenge. These experiences will continue to evolve as LLMs become more capable and efficient -- fundamentally reshaping OAT and future assistant architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, KDD Preprint</p></details> |

Previous backdoor studies focus on enclosed scenarios with consistent training and testing instructions, neglecting the practical domain gaps that could affect attack effectiveness. This paper empirically examines the generalizability of backdoor attacks during the instruction tuning of LVLMs for the first time, revealing certain limitations of most backdoor strategies in practical scenarios. We quantitatively evaluate the generalizability of six typical backdoor attacks on image caption benchmarks across multiple LVLMs, considering both visual and textual domain offsets. Our findings indicate that attack generalizability is positively correlated with the backdoor trigger's irrelevance to specific images/models and the preferential correlation of the trigger pattern. Additionally, we modify existing backdoor attacks based on the above key observations, demonstrating significant improvements in cross-domain scenario generalizability (+86% attack success rate). Notably, even without access to the instruction datasets, a multimodal instruction set can be successfully poisoned with a very low poisoning rate (0.2%), achieving an attack success rate of over 97%. This paper underscores that even simple traditional backdoor strategies pose a serious threat to LVLMs, necessitating more attention and in-depth research.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

However, their proficiency within the chemistry domain remains restricted, especially in solving professional molecule-related tasks. This challenge is attributed to their inherent limitations in comprehending molecules using only common textual representations, i.e., SMILES strings. In this study, we seek to enhance the ability of LLMs to comprehend molecules by designing and equipping them with a multi-modal external module, namely MolX. In particular, instead of directly using a SMILES string to represent a molecule, we utilize specific encoders to extract fine-grained features from both SMILES string and 2D molecular graph representations for feeding into an LLM. Moreover, a human-defined molecular fingerprint is incorporated to leverage its embedded domain knowledge. Then, to establish an alignment between MolX and the LLM's textual input space, the whole model in which the LLM is frozen, is pre-trained with a versatile strategy including a diverse set of tasks. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our proposed method only introduces a small number of trainable parameters while outperforming baselines on various downstream molecule-related tasks ranging from molecule-to-text translation to retrosynthesis, with and without fine-tuning the LLM.</p></details> |  |

Consolidating distributed model state into a single checkpoint unacceptably slows down training, and is impractical at extreme scales. Distributed checkpoints, in contrast, are tightly coupled to the model parallelism and hardware configurations of the training run, and thus unusable on different configurations. To address this problem, we propose Universal Checkpointing, a technique that enables efficient checkpoint creation while providing the flexibility of resuming on arbitrary parallelism strategy and hardware configurations. Universal Checkpointing unlocks unprecedented capabilities for large-scale training such as improved resilience to hardware failures through continued training on remaining healthy hardware, and reduced training time through opportunistic exploitation of elastic capacity. The key insight of Universal Checkpointing is the selection of the optimal representation in each phase of the checkpointing life cycle: distributed representation for saving, and consolidated representation for loading. This is achieved using two key mechanisms. First, the universal checkpoint format, which consists of a consolidated representation of each model parameter and metadata for mapping parameter fragments into training ranks of arbitrary model-parallelism configuration. Second, the universal checkpoint language, a simple but powerful specification language for converting distributed checkpoints into the universal checkpoint format. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of Universal Checkpointing on state-of-the-art model architectures and a wide range of parallelism techniques.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmark datasets are limited in scale and suffer from difficulties in handling out-of-scope samples that arise in multi-turn conversational interactions. We introduce MIntRec2.0, a large-scale benchmark dataset for multimodal intent recognition in multi-party conversations. It contains 1,245 dialogues with 15,040 samples, each annotated within a new intent taxonomy of 30 fine-grained classes. Besides 9,304 in-scope samples, it also includes 5,736 out-of-scope samples appearing in multi-turn contexts, which naturally occur in real-world scenarios. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive information on the speakers in each utterance, enriching its utility for multi-party conversational research. We establish a general framework supporting the organization of single-turn and multi-turn dialogue data, modality feature extraction, multimodal fusion, as well as in-scope classification and out-of-scope detection. Evaluation benchmarks are built using classic multimodal fusion methods, ChatGPT, and human evaluators. While existing methods incorporating nonverbal information yield improvements, effectively leveraging context information and detecting out-of-scope samples remains a substantial challenge. Notably, large language models exhibit a significant performance gap compared to humans, highlighting the limitations of machine learning methods in the cognitive intent understanding task. We believe that MIntRec2.0 will serve as a valuable resource, providing a pioneering foundation for research in human-machine conversational interactions, and significantly facilitating related applications.

| **[Mélange: Cost Efficient Large Language Model Serving by Exploiting GPU Heterogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14527v3)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into many online services, yet they remain cost-prohibitive to deploy due to the requirement of expensive GPU instances. Prior work has addressed the high cost of LLM serving by improving the inference engine, but less attention has been given to selecting the most cost-efficient GPU type(s) for a specific LLM service. There is a large and growing landscape of GPU types and, within these options, higher cost does not always lead to increased performance. Instead, through a comprehensive investigation, we find that three key LLM service characteristics (request size, request rate, SLO) strongly influence GPU cost efficiency, and differing GPU types are most cost efficient for differing LLM service settings. As a result, the most cost-efficient allocation for a given service is typically a mix of heterogeneous GPU types. Based on this analysis, we introduce M\'elange, a GPU allocation framework that navigates these diverse LLM service characteristics and heterogeneous GPU option space to automatically and efficiently derive the minimal-cost GPU allocation for a given LLM service. We formulate the GPU allocation task as a cost-aware bin packing problem where GPUs are bins and items are slices of the service workload. Our formulation's constraints account for a service's unique characteristics, allowing M\'elange to be flexible to support diverse service settings and heterogeneity-aware to adapt the GPU allocation to a specific service. Compared to using only a single GPU type, M\'elange reduces deployment costs by up to 77% in conversational settings, 33% in document-based settings, and 51% in a mixed setting.</p></details> |  |

Our findings reveal several key insights: (1) ChatGPT and Copilot are the most frequently utilized for generating code on GitHub. In contrast, there is very little code generated by other LLMs on GitHub. (2) Projects containing ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code are often small and less known, led by individuals or small teams. Despite this, most projects are continuously evolving and improving. (3) ChatGPT/Copilot is mainly utilized for generating Python, Java, and TypeScript scripts for data processing and transformation. C/C++ and JavaScript code generation focuses on algorithm and data structure implementation and user interface code. Most ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code snippets are relatively short and exhibit low complexity. (4) Compared to human-written code, ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code exists in a small proportion of projects and generally undergoes fewer modifications. Additionally, modifications due to bugs are even fewer, ranging from just 3% to 8% across different languages. (5) Most comments on ChatGPT/Copilot-generated code lack detailed information, often only stating the code's origin without mentioning prompts, human modifications, or testing status. Based on these findings, we discuss the implications for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

In the present work, we explored the potential of LLMs in assisting video content analysis by conducting a case study that followed a new workflow of LLM-assisted multimodal content analysis. The workflow encompasses codebook design, prompt engineering, LLM processing, and human evaluation. We strategically crafted annotation prompts to get LLM Annotations in structured form and explanation prompts to generate LLM Explanations for a better understanding of LLM reasoning and transparency. To test LLM's video annotation capabilities, we analyzed 203 keyframes extracted from 25 YouTube short videos about depression. We compared the LLM Annotations with those of two human coders and found that LLM has higher accuracy in object and activity Annotations than emotion and genre Annotations. Moreover, we identified the potential and limitations of LLM's capabilities in annotating videos. Based on the findings, we explore opportunities and challenges for future research and improvements to the workflow. We also discuss ethical concerns surrounding future studies based on LLM-assisted video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, under review in CSCW 24</p></details> |

To address this, we propose a method that deconstructs complex real-world questions into a graph, representing each question as a node with parent nodes of background knowledge needed to solve the question. We develop the DepthQA dataset, deconstructing questions into three depths: (i) recalling conceptual knowledge, (ii) applying procedural knowledge, and (iii) analyzing strategic knowledge. Based on a hierarchical graph, we quantify forward discrepancy, discrepancies in LLMs' performance on simpler sub-problems versus complex questions. We also measure backward discrepancy, where LLMs answer complex questions but struggle with simpler ones. Our analysis shows that smaller models have more discrepancies than larger models. Additionally, guiding models from simpler to complex questions through multi-turn interactions improves performance across model sizes, highlighting the importance of structured intermediate steps in knowledge reasoning. This work enhances our understanding of LLM reasoning and suggests ways to improve their problem-solving abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress; code is available at https://github.com/kaistAI/knowledge-reasoning</p></details> |

Previous studies have highlighted stereotypes and biases present in LLM outputs, emphasizing the need to evaluate these models for their alignment with human narrative styles and potential gender biases. In this study, we assess the alignment of three prominent LLMs - Claude 3 Opus, Mistral AI Large, and Gemini 1.5 Flash - by analyzing their performance on benchmark text-generation tasks for scientific abstracts. We employ the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) framework to extract lexical, psychological, and social features from the generated texts. Our findings indicate that, while these models generally produce text closely resembling human authored content, variations in stylistic features suggest significant gender biases. This research highlights the importance of developing LLMs that maintain a diversity of writing styles to promote inclusivity in academic discourse.</p></details> |  |

Initially, we employ Bounded Model Checking (BMC) to identify vulnerabilities and extract counterexamples. These counterexamples are supported by mathematical proofs and the stack trace of the vulnerabilities. Using a specially designed prompt, we combine the original source code with the identified vulnerability, including its stack trace and counterexample that specifies the line number and error type. This combined information is then fed into an LLM, which is instructed to attempt to fix the code. The new code is subsequently verified again using BMC to ensure the fix succeeded. We present the ESBMC-AI framework as a proof of concept, leveraging the well-recognized and industry-adopted Efficient SMT-based Context-Bounded Model Checker (ESBMC) and a pre-trained transformer model to detect and fix errors in C programs, particularly in critical software components. We evaluated our approach on 50,000 C programs randomly selected from the FormAI dataset with their respective vulnerability classifications. Our results demonstrate ESBMC-AI's capability to automate the detection and repair of issues such as buffer overflow, arithmetic overflow, and pointer dereference failures with high accuracy. ESBMC-AI is a pioneering initiative, integrating LLMs with BMC techniques, offering potential integration into the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) process within the software development lifecycle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Generate High-quality Patent Claims?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19465v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance across various text generation tasks but remain under-explored in the patent domain, which offers highly structured and precise language. This paper constructs a dataset to investigate the performance of current LLMs in patent claim generation. Our results demonstrate that generating claims based on patent descriptions outperforms previous research relying on abstracts. Interestingly, current patent-specific LLMs perform much worse than state-of-the-art general LLMs, highlighting the necessity for future research on in-domain LLMs. We also find that LLMs can produce high-quality first independent claims, but their performances markedly decrease for subsequent dependent claims. Moreover, fine-tuning can enhance the completeness of inventions' features, conceptual clarity, and feature linkage. Among the tested LLMs, GPT-4 demonstrates the best performance in comprehensive human evaluations by patent experts, with better feature coverage, conceptual clarity, and technical coherence. Despite these capabilities, comprehensive revision and modification are still necessary to pass rigorous patent scrutiny and ensure legal robustness.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Advancements in multilingual pre-trained models such as XLM-R and mT5 have contributed to the increasing interest in cross-lingual sentiment analysis. The recent emergence in Large Language Models (LLM) has significantly advanced general NLP tasks, however, the capability of such LLMs in cross-lingual sentiment analysis has not been fully studied. This work undertakes an empirical analysis to compare the cross-lingual transfer capability of public Small Multilingual Language Models (SMLM) like XLM-R, against English-centric LLMs such as Llama-3, in the context of sentiment analysis across English, Spanish, French and Chinese. Our findings reveal that among public models, SMLMs exhibit superior zero-shot cross-lingual performance relative to LLMs. However, in few-shot cross-lingual settings, public LLMs demonstrate an enhanced adaptive potential. In addition, we observe that proprietary GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 lead in zero-shot cross-lingual capability, but are outpaced by public models in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WASSA workshop at ACL2024</p></details> |

Mini-batch training is commonly used to train GNNs on large graphs, and data parallelism is the standard approach to scale mini-batch training across multiple GPUs. One of the major performance costs in GNN training is the loading of input features, which prevents GPUs from being fully utilized. In this paper, we argue that this problem is exacerbated by redundancies that are inherent to the data parallel approach. To address this issue, we introduce a hybrid parallel mini-batch training paradigm called split parallelism. Split parallelism avoids redundant data loads and splits the sampling and training of each mini-batch across multiple GPUs online, at each iteration, using a lightweight splitting algorithm. We implement split parallelism in GSplit and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art mini-batch training systems like DGL, Quiver, and $P^3$.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have found that common interventions such as instruction tuning often result in poorly calibrated LLMs. Although calibration is well-explored in traditional applications, calibrating LLMs is uniquely challenging. These challenges stem as much from the severe computational requirements of LLMs as from their versatility, which allows them to be applied to diverse tasks. Addressing these challenges, we propose THERMOMETER, a calibration approach tailored to LLMs. THERMOMETER learns an auxiliary model, given data from multiple tasks, for calibrating a LLM. It is computationally efficient, preserves the accuracy of the LLM, and produces better-calibrated responses for new tasks. Extensive empirical evaluations across various benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera ready version for ICML 2024</p></details> |

Task arithmetic has emerged as a cost-effective approach for MTL. It enables performance enhancement across multiple tasks by adding their corresponding task vectors to a pre-trained model. However, the current lack of a method that can simultaneously achieve optimal performance, computational efficiency, and data privacy limits their application to LLMs. In this paper, we propose \textbf{M}odel \textbf{E}xclusive \textbf{T}ask \textbf{A}rithmetic for merging \textbf{GPT}-scale models, which formalizes the objective of model merging into a multi-task learning framework, aiming to minimize the average loss difference between the merged model and each individual task model. Since data privacy limits the use of multi-task training data, we leverage LLMs' local linearity and task vectors' orthogonality to separate the data term and scaling coefficients term and derive a model-exclusive task arithmetic method. Our proposed MetaGPT is data-agnostic and bypasses the heavy search process, making it cost-effective and easy to implement for LLMs.Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaGPT leads to improvements in task arithmetic and achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple tasks.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[GPTFUZZER: Red Teaming Large Language Models with Auto-Generated Jailbreak Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.10253v4)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently experienced tremendous popularity and are widely used from casual conversations to AI-driven programming. However, despite their considerable success, LLMs are not entirely reliable and can give detailed guidance on how to conduct harmful or illegal activities. While safety measures can reduce the risk of such outputs, adversarial jailbreak attacks can still exploit LLMs to produce harmful content. These jailbreak templates are typically manually crafted, making large-scale testing challenging. In this paper, we introduce GPTFuzz, a novel black-box jailbreak fuzzing framework inspired by the AFL fuzzing framework. Instead of manual engineering, GPTFuzz automates the generation of jailbreak templates for red-teaming LLMs. At its core, GPTFuzz starts with human-written templates as initial seeds, then mutates them to produce new templates. We detail three key components of GPTFuzz: a seed selection strategy for balancing efficiency and variability, mutate operators for creating semantically equivalent or similar sentences, and a judgment model to assess the success of a jailbreak attack. We evaluate GPTFuzz against various commercial and open-source LLMs, including ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Vicuna, under diverse attack scenarios. Our results indicate that GPTFuzz consistently produces jailbreak templates with a high success rate, surpassing human-crafted templates. Remarkably, GPTFuzz achieves over 90% attack success rates against ChatGPT and Llama-2 models, even with suboptimal initial seed templates. We anticipate that GPTFuzz will be instrumental for researchers and practitioners in examining LLM robustness and will encourage further exploration into enhancing LLM safety.</p></details> |  |

Unlike commercial health apps for wearables, our system offers a comprehensive statistical analysis component that discovers correlations and trends in user data, allowing users to ask questions in natural language and receive generated personalized insights, and guides them to develop actionable goals. As a case study, we focus on improving sleep quality, given its measurability through physiological data and its importance to general well-being.

At least two opinion camps exist: one excited about possibilities these models offer for fundamental changes to human tasks, and another highly concerned about power these models seem to have. To address these concerns, we assessed several LLMs, primarily GPT 3.5, using standard, normed, and validated cognitive and personality measures. For this seedling project, we developed a battery of tests that allowed us to estimate the boundaries of some of these models capabilities, how stable those capabilities are over a short period of time, and how they compare to humans. Our results indicate that LLMs are unlikely to have developed sentience, although its ability to respond to personality inventories is interesting. GPT3.5 did display large variability in both cognitive and personality measures over repeated observations, which is not expected if it had a human-like personality. Variability notwithstanding, LLMs display what in a human would be considered poor mental health, including low self-esteem, marked dissociation from reality, and in some cases narcissism and psychopathy, despite upbeat and helpful responses.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

Challenging Multimodal Large Language Models with Multipanel VQA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15847v3)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multipanel images, commonly seen as web screenshots, posters, etc., pervade our daily lives. These images, characterized by their composition of multiple subfigures in distinct layouts, effectively convey information to people. Toward building advanced multimodal AI applications, such as agents that understand complex scenes and navigate through webpages, the skill of multipanel visual reasoning is essential, and a comprehensive evaluation of models in this regard is important. Therefore, we introduce Multipanel Visual Question Answering (MultipanelVQA), a novel benchmark comprising 6,600 triplets of questions, answers, and multipanel images that specifically challenge models in comprehending multipanel images. Our evaluation shows that questions in the MultipanelVQA benchmark pose significant challenges to the state-of-the-art Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) tested, even though humans can attain approximately 99% accuracy on these questions. Distinctively, the MultipanelVQA benchmark features synthetically generated multipanel images specifically crafted to isolate and assess the impact of various factors, such as the layout, on MLLMs' multipanel image comprehension abilities. As a result, in addition to benchmarking the capabilities of MLLMs in understanding multipanel images, we analyze various factors of the multipanel image that affect MLLMs' performance with synthetic data and offer insights for enhancement.

While such qualitative capabilities are vital to medical diagnosis, in real-world scenarios, doctors frequently use clinical calculators that follow quantitative equations and rule-based reasoning paradigms for evidence-based decision support. To this end, we propose MedCalc-Bench, a first-of-its-kind dataset focused on evaluating the medical calculation capability of LLMs. MedCalc-Bench contains an evaluation set of over 1000 manually reviewed instances from 55 different medical calculation tasks. Each instance in MedCalc-Bench consists of a patient note, a question requesting to compute a specific medical value, a ground truth answer, and a step-by-step explanation showing how the answer is obtained. While our evaluation results show the potential of LLMs in this area, none of them are effective enough for clinical settings. Common issues include extracting the incorrect entities, not using the correct equation or rules for a calculation task, or incorrectly performing the arithmetic for the computation. We hope our study highlights the quantitative knowledge and reasoning gaps in LLMs within medical settings, encouraging future improvements of LLMs for various clinical calculation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github link: https://github.com/ncbi-nlp/MedCalc-Bench HuggingFace link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nsk7153/MedCalc-Bench</p></details> |

Recently, this has been approached by presenting LLMs with survey questions and quantifying their stances towards morally and politically charged statements. However, the stances generated by LLMs can vary greatly depending on how they are prompted, and there are many ways to argue for or against a given position. In this work, we propose to address this by analysing a large and robust dataset of 156k LLM responses to the 62 propositions of the Political Compass Test (PCT) generated by 6 LLMs using 420 prompt variations. We perform coarse-grained analysis of their generated stances and fine-grained analysis of the plain text justifications for those stances. For fine-grained analysis, we propose to identify tropes in the responses: semantically similar phrases that are recurrent and consistent across different prompts, revealing patterns in the text that a given LLM is prone to produce. We find that demographic features added to prompts significantly affect outcomes on the PCT, reflecting bias, as well as disparities between the results of tests when eliciting closed-form vs. open domain responses. Additionally, patterns in the plain text rationales via tropes show that similar justifications are repeatedly generated across models and prompts even with disparate stances.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 20 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Hence, comprehending the citation patterns exhibited by authors is essential for assessing their research impact and contributions within their respective fields. Although the h-index, introduced by Hirsch in 2005, has emerged as a popular bibliometric indicator, it fails to account for the intricate relationships between authors and their citation patterns. This limitation becomes particularly relevant in cases where citations are strategically employed to boost the perceived influence of certain individuals or groups, a phenomenon that we term "orchestration". Orchestrated citations can introduce biases in citation rankings and therefore necessitate the identification of such patterns. Here, we use Scopus data to investigate orchestration of citations across all scientific disciplines. Orchestration could be small-scale, when the author him/herself and/or a small number of other authors use citations strategically to boost citation metrics like h-index; or large-scale, where extensive collaborations among many co-authors lead to high h-index for many/all of them. We propose three orchestration indicators: extremely low values in the ratio of citations over the square of the h-index (indicative of small-scale orchestration); extremely small number of authors who can explain at least 50% of an author's total citations (indicative of either small-scale or large-scale orchestration); and extremely large number of co-authors with more than 50 co-authored papers (indicative of large-scale orchestration). The distributions, potential thresholds based on 1% (and 5%) percentiles, and insights from these indicators are explored and put into perspective across science.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy: A Universal Evaluation Framework for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12644v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in addressing diverse tasks is essential for comprehending their strengths and weaknesses. Conventional evaluation techniques typically apply a single prompting strategy uniformly across datasets, not considering the varying degrees of task complexity. We introduce the Hierarchical Prompting Taxonomy (HPT), a taxonomy that employs a Hierarchical Prompt Framework (HPF) composed of five unique prompting strategies, arranged from the simplest to the most complex, to assess LLMs more precisely and to offer a clearer perspective. This taxonomy assigns a score, called the Hierarchical Prompting Score (HP-Score), to datasets as well as LLMs based on the rules of the taxonomy, providing a nuanced understanding of their ability to solve diverse tasks and offering a universal measure of task complexity. Additionally, we introduce the Adaptive Hierarchical Prompt framework, which automates the selection of appropriate prompting strategies for each task. This study compares manual and adaptive hierarchical prompt frameworks using four instruction-tuned LLMs, namely Llama 3 8B, Phi 3 3.8B, Mistral 7B, and Gemma 7B, across four datasets: BoolQ, CommonSenseQA (CSQA), IWSLT-2017 en-fr (IWSLT), and SamSum. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HPT, providing a reliable way to compare different tasks and LLM capabilities. This paper leads to the development of a universal evaluation metric that can be used to evaluate both the complexity of the datasets and the capabilities of LLMs. The implementation of both manual HPF and adaptive HPF is publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Large Model Training through Overlapped Activation Recomputation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08756v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large model training has been using recomputation to alleviate the memory pressure and pipelining to exploit the parallelism of data, tensor, and devices. The existing recomputation approaches may incur up to 40% overhead when training real-world models, e.g., the GPT model with 22B parameters. This is because they are executed on demand in the critical training path. In this paper, we design a new recomputation framework, Lynx, to reduce the overhead by overlapping the recomputation with communication occurring in training pipelines. It consists of an optimal scheduling algorithm (OPT) and a heuristic-based scheduling algorithm (HEU). OPT achieves a global optimum but suffers from a long search time. HEU was designed based on our observation that there are identical structures in large DNN models so that we can apply the same scheduling policy to all identical structures. HEU achieves a local optimum but reduces the search time by 99% compared to OPT. Our comprehensive evaluation using GPT models with 1.3B-20B parameters shows that both OPT and HEU outperform the state-of-the-art recomputation approaches (e.g., Megatron-LM and Checkmake) by 1.02-1.53x. HEU achieves a similar performance as OPT with a search time of 0.16s on average.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Despite recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs), their ability to comprehend causality remains unclear. Previous work typically focuses on commonsense causality between events and/or actions, which is insufficient for applications like embodied agents and lacks the explicitly defined causal graphs required for formal causal reasoning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fine-grained and unified definition of causality involving interactions between humans and/or objects. Building on the definition, we construct a novel dataset, CELLO, consisting of 14,094 causal questions across all four levels of causality: discovery, association, intervention, and counterfactual. This dataset surpasses traditional commonsense causality by including explicit causal graphs that detail the interactions between humans and objects. Extensive experiments on CELLO reveal that current LVLMs still struggle with causal reasoning tasks, but they can benefit significantly from our proposed CELLO-CoT, a causally inspired chain-of-thought prompting strategy. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses from this study provide valuable insights for future research. Our project page is at https://github.com/OpenCausaLab/CELLO.</p></details> |  |

A recent trend is to use preference learning to fine-tune models to align with factuality. However, existing work primarily evaluates fine-tuned models on in-domain (ID) datasets and the factuality on out-of-domain (OOD) datasets remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the factuality of different models tuned by various preference learning algorithms and demonstrate that their performance on OOD datasets either increases minimally or decreases. Subsequently, we reveal that the main cause of model's failure to uphold factuality under a distribution shift is \textbf{under-alignment}, rather than \textbf{over-alignment}, by analyzing the token distribution shift of the models before and after tuning. Finally, we propose \textbf{APEFT} (\textbf{A}tomic \textbf{P}reference \textbf{E}nhanced \textbf{F}actuality \textbf{T}uning), a framework that enhances model's awareness of factuality at the granularity of individual facts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that APEFT improves model performance by an average of $\boldsymbol{3.45\%}$ on both ID and OOD datasets, which is highly effective.</p></details> |  |

These characteristics demand a high level of detail perception ability from MLLMs. While increasing input resolution improves detail perception, it also leads to longer sequences of visual tokens, increasing computational costs and straining the models' ability to handle long contexts. To address these challenges, we introduce DocKylin, a document-centric MLLM that performs visual content slimming at both the pixel and token levels, thereby reducing token sequence length in VDU scenarios. DocKylin utilizes an Adaptive Pixel Slimming (APS) preprocessing module to perform pixel-level slimming, increasing the proportion of informative pixels. Moreover, DocKylin incorporates a novel Dynamic Token Slimming (DTS) module to conduct token-level slimming, filtering essential tokens and removing others to create a compressed, adaptive visual sequence. Experiments demonstrate DocKylin's promising performance across various VDU benchmarks. Notably, both the proposed APS and DTS are parameter-free, facilitating easy integration into existing MLLMs, and our experiments indicate their potential for broader applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current works for evaluating the spatio-temporal understanding capability of LLMs are somewhat limited and biased. These works either fail to incorporate the latest language models or only focus on assessing the memorized spatio-temporal knowledge. To address this gap, this paper dissects LLMs' capability of spatio-temporal data into four distinct dimensions: knowledge comprehension, spatio-temporal reasoning, accurate computation, and downstream applications. We curate several natural language question-answer tasks for each category and build the benchmark dataset, namely STBench, containing 13 distinct tasks and over 60,000 QA pairs. Moreover, we have assessed the capabilities of 13 LLMs, such as GPT-4o, Gemma and Mistral. Experimental results reveal that existing LLMs show remarkable performance on knowledge comprehension and spatio-temporal reasoning tasks, with potential for further enhancement on other tasks through in-context learning, chain-of-though prompting, and fine-tuning. The code and datasets of STBench are released on https://github.com/LwbXc/STBench.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid development of code LLMs, many popular evaluation benchmarks, such as HumanEval, DS-1000, and MBPP, have emerged to measure the performance of code LLMs with a particular focus on code generation tasks. However, they are insufficient to cover the full range of expected capabilities of code LLMs, which span beyond code generation to answering diverse coding-related questions. To fill this gap, we propose InfiBench, the first large-scale freeform question-answering (QA) benchmark for code to our knowledge, comprising 234 carefully selected high-quality Stack Overflow questions that span across 15 programming languages. InfiBench uses four types of model-free automatic metrics to evaluate response correctness where domain experts carefully concretize the criterion for each question. We conduct a systematic evaluation for over 100 latest code LLMs on InfiBench, leading to a series of novel and insightful findings. Our detailed analyses showcase potential directions for further advancement of code LLMs. InfiBench is fully open source and continuously expanding to foster more scientific and systematic practices for code LLM evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 10 pages for main content, work in progress</p></details> |

Poetry Evaluation for Large Models and Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18906v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) can now generate and recognize text in a wide range of styles and genres, including highly specialized, creative genres like poetry. But what do LLMs really know about poetry? What can they know about poetry? We develop a task to evaluate how well LLMs recognize a specific aspect of poetry, poetic form, for more than 20 forms and formal elements in the English language. Poetic form captures many different poetic features, including rhyme scheme, meter, and word or line repetition. We use this task to reflect on LLMs' current poetic capabilities, as well as the challenges and pitfalls of creating NLP benchmarks for poetry and for other creative tasks. In particular, we use this task to audit and reflect on the poems included in popular pretraining datasets. Our findings have implications for NLP researchers interested in model evaluation, digital humanities and cultural analytics scholars, and cultural heritage professionals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Text-based Knowledge Graph Completion with Zero-Shot Large Language Models: A Focus on Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08279v3)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The design and development of text-based knowledge graph completion (KGC) methods leveraging textual entity descriptions are at the forefront of research. These methods involve advanced optimization techniques such as soft prompts and contrastive learning to enhance KGC models. The effectiveness of text-based methods largely hinges on the quality and richness of the training data. Large language models (LLMs) can utilize straightforward prompts to alter text data, thereby enabling data augmentation for KGC. Nevertheless, LLMs typically demand substantial computational resources. To address these issues, we introduce a framework termed constrained prompts for KGC (CP-KGC). This CP-KGC framework designs prompts that adapt to different datasets to enhance semantic richness. Additionally, CP-KGC employs a context constraint strategy to effectively identify polysemous entities within KGC datasets. Through extensive experimentation, we have verified the effectiveness of this framework. Even after quantization, the LLM (Qwen-7B-Chat-int4) still enhances the performance of text-based KGC methods \footnote{Code and datasets are available at \href{https://github.com/sjlmg/CP-KGC}{https://github.com/sjlmg/CP-KGC}}. This study extends the performance limits of existing models and promotes further integration of KGC with LLMs.</p></details> | new version |

Structured pruning, offers an effective means to compress LLMs, thereby reducing storage costs and enhancing inference speed for more efficient utilization. In this work, we study data-efficient and resource-efficient structure pruning methods to obtain smaller yet still powerful models. Knowledge Distillation is well-suited for pruning, as the intact model can serve as an excellent teacher for pruned students. However, it becomes challenging in the context of LLMs due to memory constraints. To address this, we propose an efficient progressive Numerous-teacher pruning method (NutePrune). NutePrune mitigates excessive memory costs by loading only one intact model and integrating it with various masks and LoRA modules, enabling it to seamlessly switch between teacher and student roles. This approach allows us to leverage numerous teachers with varying capacities to progressively guide the pruned model, enhancing overall performance. Extensive experiments across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of NutePrune. In LLaMA-7B zero-shot experiments, NutePrune retains 97.17% of the performance of the original model at 20% sparsity and 95.07% at 25% sparsity. Our code is available at https://github.com/Lucius-lsr/NutePrune.</p></details> |  |

We investigate their effectiveness for NLP tasks in low-resource languages (LRLs), especially in the setting of zero-labelled cross-lingual transfer (0-CLT), where no labelled training data for the target language is available -- however training data from one or more related medium-resource languages (MRLs) is utilized, alongside the available unlabeled test data for a target language. We introduce Self-Supervised Prompting (SSP), a novel ICL approach tailored for the 0-CLT setting. SSP is based on the key observation that LLMs output more accurate labels if in-context exemplars are from the target language (even if their labels are slightly noisy). To operationalize this, since target language training data is not available in 0-CLT, SSP operates in two stages. In Stage I, using source MRL training data, target language's test data is noisily labeled. In Stage II, these noisy test data points are used as exemplars in ICL for further improved labelling. Additionally, our implementation of SSP uses a novel Integer Linear Programming (ILP)-based exemplar selection that balances similarity, prediction confidence (when available) and label coverage. Experiments on three tasks and eleven LRLs (from three regions) demonstrate that SSP strongly outperforms existing SOTA fine-tuned and prompting-based baselines in 0-CLT setup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Model Summarizers Adapt to Diverse Scientific Communication Goals?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10415v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate the controllability of large language models (LLMs) on scientific summarization tasks. We identify key stylistic and content coverage factors that characterize different types of summaries such as paper reviews, abstracts, and lay summaries. By controlling stylistic features, we find that non-fine-tuned LLMs outperform humans in the MuP review generation task, both in terms of similarity to reference summaries and human preferences. Also, we show that we can improve the controllability of LLMs with keyword-based classifier-free guidance (CFG) while achieving lexical overlap comparable to strong fine-tuned baselines on arXiv and PubMed. However, our results also indicate that LLMs cannot consistently generate long summaries with more than 8 sentences. Furthermore, these models exhibit limited capacity to produce highly abstractive lay summaries. Although LLMs demonstrate strong generic summarization competency, sophisticated content control without costly fine-tuning remains an open problem for domain-specific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 camera ready</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Models for Cuffless Blood Pressure Measurement From Wearable Biosignals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18069v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have captured significant interest from both academia and industry due to their impressive performance across various textual tasks. However, the potential of LLMs to analyze physiological time-series data remains an emerging research field. Particularly, there is a notable gap in the utilization of LLMs for analyzing wearable biosignals to achieve cuffless blood pressure (BP) measurement, which is critical for the management of cardiovascular diseases. This paper presents the first work to explore the capacity of LLMs to perform cuffless BP estimation based on wearable biosignals. We extracted physiological features from electrocardiogram (ECG) and photoplethysmogram (PPG) signals and designed context-enhanced prompts by combining these features with BP domain knowledge and user information. Subsequently, we adapted LLMs to BP estimation tasks through fine-tuning. To evaluate the proposed approach, we conducted assessments of ten advanced LLMs using a comprehensive public dataset of wearable biosignals from 1,272 participants. The experimental results demonstrate that the optimally fine-tuned LLM significantly surpasses conventional task-specific baselines, achieving an estimation error of 0.00 $\pm$ 9.25 mmHg for systolic BP and 1.29 $\pm$ 6.37 mmHg for diastolic BP. Notably, the ablation studies highlight the benefits of our context enhancement strategy, leading to an 8.9% reduction in mean absolute error for systolic BP estimation. This paper pioneers the exploration of LLMs for cuffless BP measurement, providing a potential solution to enhance the accuracy of cuffless BP measurement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Follow Concept Annotation Guidelines? A Case Study on Scientific and Financial Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08704v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capacity to leverage in-context demonstrations, it is still unclear to what extent they can learn new concepts or facts from ground-truth labels. To address this question, we examine the capacity of instruction-tuned LLMs to follow in-context concept guidelines for sentence labeling tasks. We design guidelines that present different types of factual and counterfactual concept definitions, which are used as prompts for zero-shot sentence classification tasks. Our results show that although concept definitions consistently help in task performance, only the larger models (with 70B parameters or more) have limited ability to work under counterfactual contexts. Importantly, only proprietary models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can recognize nonsensical guidelines, which we hypothesize is due to more sophisticated alignment methods. Finally, we find that Falcon-180B-chat is outperformed by Llama-2-70B-chat is most cases, which indicates that careful fine-tuning is more effective than increasing model scale. Altogether, our simple evaluation method reveals significant gaps in concept understanding between the most capable open-source language models and the leading proprietary APIs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 camera ready</p></details> |

Existing evaluations of LVLMs primarily focus on the multi-faceted capabilities in natural circumstances, lacking automated and quantifiable assessment for self-driving, let alone the severe road corner cases. In this paper, we propose CODA-LM, the very first benchmark for the automatic evaluation of LVLMs for self-driving corner cases. We adopt a hierarchical data structure to prompt powerful LVLMs to analyze complex driving scenes and generate high-quality pre-annotation for human annotators, and for LVLM evaluation, we show that using the text-only large language models (LLMs) as judges reveals even better alignment with human preferences than the LVLM judges. Moreover, with CODA-LM, we build CODA-VLM, a new driving LVLM surpassing all the open-sourced counterparts on CODA-LM. Our CODA-VLM performs comparably with GPT-4V, even surpassing GPT-4V by +21.42% on the regional perception task. We hope CODA-LM can become the catalyst to promote interpretable self-driving empowered by LVLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://coda-dataset.github.io/coda-lm/</p></details> |

To solve this problem, many approaches learn a surrogate function that estimates the underlying objective from limited historical evaluations. Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong pattern-matching capabilities via pretraining on vast amounts of data, stand out as a potential candidate for surrogate modeling. However, directly prompting a pretrained language model to produce predictions is not feasible in many scientific domains due to the scarcity of domain-specific data in the pretraining corpora and the challenges of articulating complex problems in natural language. In this work, we introduce LICO, a general-purpose model that extends arbitrary base LLMs for black-box optimization, with a particular application to the molecular domain. To achieve this, we equip the language model with a separate embedding layer and prediction layer, and train the model to perform in-context predictions on a diverse set of functions defined over the domain. Once trained, LICO can generalize to unseen molecule properties simply via in-context prompting. LICO achieves state-of-the-art performance on PMO, a challenging molecular optimization benchmark comprising over 20 objective functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Large Language Model Approach to Educational Survey Feedback Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17447v2)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper assesses the potential for the large language models (LLMs) GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 to aid in deriving insight from education feedback surveys. Exploration of LLM use cases in education has focused on teaching and learning, with less exploration of capabilities in education feedback analysis. Survey analysis in education involves goals such as finding gaps in curricula or evaluating teachers, often requiring time-consuming manual processing of textual responses. LLMs have the potential to provide a flexible means of achieving these goals without specialized machine learning models or fine-tuning. We demonstrate a versatile approach to such goals by treating them as sequences of natural language processing (NLP) tasks including classification (multi-label, multi-class, and binary), extraction, thematic analysis, and sentiment analysis, each performed by LLM. We apply these workflows to a real-world dataset of 2500 end-of-course survey comments from biomedical science courses, and evaluate a zero-shot approach (i.e., requiring no examples or labeled training data) across all tasks, reflecting education settings, where labeled data is often scarce. By applying effective prompting practices, we achieve human-level performance on multiple tasks with GPT-4, enabling workflows necessary to achieve typical goals. We also show the potential of inspecting LLMs' chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for providing insight that may foster confidence in practice. Moreover, this study features development of a versatile set of classification categories, suitable for various course types (online, hybrid, or in-person) and amenable to customization. Our results suggest that LLMs can be used to derive a range of insights from survey text.</p></details> |  |

However, due to prohibitively high cost in time and money, there is still lack of open-source and large-scale benchmarks in this field. It is mainly the case for airfoil inverse design, which requires to generate and edit diverse geometric-qualified and aerodynamic-qualified airfoils following the multimodal instructions, \emph{i.e.,} dragging points and physical parameters. This paper presents the open-source endeavors in airfoil inverse design, \emph{AFBench}, including a large-scale dataset with 200 thousand airfoils and high-quality aerodynamic and geometric labels, two novel and practical airfoil inverse design tasks, \emph{i.e.,} conditional generation on multimodal physical parameters, controllable editing, and comprehensive metrics to evaluate various existing airfoil inverse design methods. Our aim is to establish \emph{AFBench} as an ecosystem for training and evaluating airfoil inverse design methods, with a specific focus on data-driven controllable inverse design models by multimodal instructions capable of bridging the gap between ideas and execution, the academic research and industrial applications. We have provided baseline models, comprehensive experimental observations, and analysis to accelerate future research. Our baseline model is trained on an RTX 3090 GPU within 16 hours.

However, current state-of-the-art LLMs are predominantly based on English. They encounter limitations when directly applied to tasks in specific cultural domains, due to deficiencies in domain-specific knowledge and misunderstandings caused by differences in cultural values. To address this challenge, our paper proposes a rapid adaptation method for large models in specific cultural contexts, which leverages instruction-tuning based on specific cultural knowledge and safety values data. Taking Chinese as the specific cultural context and utilizing the LLaMA3-8B as the experimental English LLM, the evaluation results demonstrate that the adapted LLM significantly enhances its capabilities in domain-specific knowledge and adaptability to safety values, while maintaining its original expertise advantages.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[OutlierTune: Efficient Channel-Wise Quantization for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18832v1)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantizing the activations of large language models (LLMs) has been a significant challenge due to the presence of structured outliers. Most existing methods focus on the per-token or per-tensor quantization of activations, making it difficult to achieve both accuracy and hardware efficiency. To address this problem, we propose OutlierTune, an efficient per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) method for the activations of LLMs. OutlierTune consists of two components: pre-execution of dequantization and symmetrization. The pre-execution of dequantization updates the model weights by the activation scaling factors, avoiding the internal scaling and costly additional computational overheads brought by the per-channel activation quantization. The symmetrization further reduces the quantization differences arising from the weight updates by ensuring the balanced numerical ranges across different activation channels. OutlierTune is easy to implement and hardware-efficient, introducing almost no additional computational overheads during the inference. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods across multiple different tasks. Demonstrating better generalization, this framework improves the Int6 quantization of the instruction-tuning LLMs, such as OPT-IML, to the same level as half-precision (FP16). Moreover, we have shown that the proposed framework is 1.48x faster than the FP16 implementation while reducing approximately 2x memory usage.</p></details> |  |

The advent of Large Pre-trained Models (LPtM) has significantly transformed this landscape, offering unprecedented capabilities by leveraging vast amounts of data to understand and predict complex patterns. This paper surveys the pivotal integration of LPtMs with HAI, emphasizing how these models enhance collaborative intelligence beyond traditional approaches. It examines the potential of LPtMs in augmenting human capabilities, discussing this collaboration for AI model improvements, effective teaming, ethical considerations, and their broad applied implications in various sectors. Through this exploration, the study sheds light on the transformative impact of LPtM-enhanced HAI Teaming, providing insights for future research, policy development, and strategic implementations aimed at harnessing the full potential of this collaboration for research and societal benefit.</p></details> |  |

Bayesian Optimization (BO), a popular machine learning based optimization strategy, has been leveraged to automate analog design given its applicability across various circuit topologies and technologies. Traditional BO methods employ black box Gaussian Process surrogate models and optimized labeled data queries to find optimization solutions by trading off between exploration and exploitation. However, the search for the optimal design solution in BO can be expensive from both a computational and data usage point of view, particularly for high dimensional optimization problems. This paper presents ADO-LLM, the first work integrating large language models (LLMs) with Bayesian Optimization for analog design optimization. ADO-LLM leverages the LLM's ability to infuse domain knowledge to rapidly generate viable design points to remedy BO's inefficiency in finding high value design areas specifically under the limited design space coverage of the BO's probabilistic surrogate model. In the meantime, sampling of design points evaluated in the iterative BO process provides quality demonstrations for the LLM to generate high quality design points while leveraging infused broad design knowledge. Furthermore, the diversity brought by BO's exploration enriches the contextual understanding of the LLM and allows it to more broadly search in the design space and prevent repetitive and redundant suggestions. We evaluate the proposed framework on two different types of analog circuits and demonstrate notable improvements in design efficiency and effectiveness.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

Our main contribution is a novel associative memory model facilitating \textit{outlier-efficient} associative memory retrievals. Interestingly, this memory model manifests a model-based interpretation of an outlier-efficient attention mechanism (${\rm Softmax}_1$): it is an approximation of the memory retrieval process of $\mathrm{OutEffHop}$. Methodologically, this allows us to introduce novel outlier-efficient Hopfield layers as powerful alternatives to traditional attention mechanisms, with superior post-quantization performance. Theoretically, the Outlier-Efficient Modern Hopfield Model retains and improves the desirable properties of standard modern Hopfield models, including fixed point convergence and exponential storage capacity. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model across large-scale transformer-based and Hopfield-based models (including BERT, OPT, ViT, and STanHop-Net), benchmarking against state-of-the-art methods like $\mathtt{Clipped\_Softmax}$ and $\mathtt{Gated\_Attention}$.

Indeed, existing work has shown that LLMs can be used to great effect for many tasks, such as information retrieval (IR), and passage ranking. However, current state-of-the-art results heavily lean on the capabilities of the LLM being used. Currently, proprietary, and very large LLMs such as GPT-4 are the highest performing passage re-rankers. Hence, users without the resources to leverage top of the line LLMs, or ones that are closed source, are at a disadvantage. In this paper, we investigate the use of a pre-filtering step before passage re-ranking in IR. Our experiments show that by using a small number of human generated relevance scores, coupled with LLM relevance scoring, it is effectively possible to filter out irrelevant passages before re-ranking. Our experiments also show that this pre-filtering then allows the LLM to perform significantly better at the re-ranking task. Indeed, our results show that smaller models such as Mixtral can become competitive with much larger proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT and GPT-4).</p></details> |  |

HydraGNN expands the boundaries of graph neural network (GNN) in both training scale and data diversity. It abstracts over message passing algorithms, allowing both reproduction of and comparison across algorithmic innovations that define convolution in GNNs. This work discusses a series of optimizations that have allowed scaling up the GFM training to tens of thousands of GPUs on datasets that consist of hundreds of millions of graphs. Our GFMs use multi-task learning (MTL) to simultaneously learn graph-level and node-level properties of atomistic structures, such as the total energy and atomic forces. Using over 150 million atomistic structures for training, we illustrate the performance of our approach along with the lessons learned on two United States Department of Energy (US-DOE) supercomputers, namely the Perlmutter petascale system at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center and the Frontier exascale system at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The HydraGNN architecture enables the GFM to achieve near-linear strong scaling performance using more than 2,000 GPUs on Perlmutter and 16,000 GPUs on Frontier. Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) was performed on over 64,000 GPUs on Frontier to select GFM architectures with high accuracy. Early stopping was applied on each GFM architecture for energy awareness in performing such an extreme-scale task. The training of an ensemble of highest-ranked GFM architectures continued until convergence to establish uncertainty quantification (UQ) capabilities with ensemble learning. Our contribution opens the door for rapidly developing, training, and deploying GFMs using large-scale computational resources to enable AI-accelerated materials discovery and design.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |

Our approach leverages a pre-trained model, which is then incrementally decompressed to smaller sizes using progressively lower ranks. This method allows for significant reductions in computational overhead and energy consumption, as subsequent models are derived from the original without the need for retraining from scratch. We detail the implementation of PLRD, which strategically decreases the tensor ranks, thus optimizing the trade-off between model performance and resource usage. The efficacy of PLRD is demonstrated through extensive experiments showing that models trained with PLRD method on only 1B tokens maintain comparable performance with traditionally trained models while using 0.1% of the tokens. The versatility of PLRD is highlighted by its ability to generate multiple model sizes from a single foundational model, adapting fluidly to varying computational and memory budgets. Our findings suggest that PLRD could set a new standard for the efficient scaling of LLMs, making advanced AI more feasible on diverse platforms.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, vegetation structure mapping can help reduce the impacts of climate change by, for example, guiding actions to improve water security, increase biodiversity and reduce flood risk. Global satellite measurements provide an important set of observations for monitoring and managing deforestation and degradation of existing forests, natural forest regeneration, reforestation, biodiversity restoration, and the implementation of sustainable agricultural practices. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of fine-tuning of a geospatial foundation model to estimate above-ground biomass (AGB) using space-borne data collected across different eco-regions in Brazil. The fine-tuned model architecture consisted of a Swin-B transformer as the encoder (i.e., backbone) and a single convolutional layer for the decoder head. All results were compared to a U-Net which was trained as the baseline model Experimental results of this sparse-label prediction task demonstrate that the fine-tuned geospatial foundation model with a frozen encoder has comparable performance to a U-Net trained from scratch. This is despite the fine-tuned model having 13 times less parameters requiring optimization, which saves both time and compute resources. Further, we explore the transfer-learning capabilities of the geospatial foundation models by fine-tuning on satellite imagery with sparse labels from different eco-regions in Brazil.</p></details> |  |
| **[A political radicalization framework based on Moral Foundations Theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19878v1)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Moral Foundations Theory proposes that individuals with conflicting political views base their behavior on different principles chosen from a small group of universal moral foundations. This study proposes using a set of widely accepted moral foundations (Fairness, Ingroup loyalty, Authority, and Purity) as proxies to determine the degree of radicalization of online communities. The fifth principle, Care, is generally surpassed by others, which are higher in the radicalized groups' moral hierarchy. Moreover, the presented data-driven methodological framework proposes an alternative way to measure whether a community complies with some moral principle or foundation: not evaluating its speech, but its behavior through interactions of its individuals, establishing a bridge between structural features of the interaction network and the intensity of communities' radicalization regarding the considered moral foundations. Two foundations may be assessed using the network's structural characteristics: Ingroup loyalty measured by group-level modularity, and Authority evaluated using group domination for detecting potential hierarchical substructures within the network. By analyzing the set of Pareto-optimal groups regarding a multidimensional moral relevance scale, the most radicalized communities are identified among those considered extreme in some of their attitudes or views. The application of the proposed framework is illustrated using real-world datasets. The radicalized communities' behavior exhibits increasing isolation, and its authorities and leaders show growing domination over their audience. There were also detected differences between users' behavior and speech, showing that individuals tend to share more 'extreme' ingroup content than that they publish: extreme views get more likes on social media.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimodal Foundation Agent for Financial Trading: Tool-Augmented, Diversified, and Generalist](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18485v3)** | 2024-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Financial trading is a crucial component of the markets, informed by a multimodal information landscape encompassing news, prices, and Kline charts, and encompasses diverse tasks such as quantitative trading and high-frequency trading with various assets. While advanced AI techniques like deep learning and reinforcement learning are extensively utilized in finance, their application in financial trading tasks often faces challenges due to inadequate handling of multimodal data and limited generalizability across various tasks. To address these challenges, we present FinAgent, a multimodal foundational agent with tool augmentation for financial trading. FinAgent's market intelligence module processes a diverse range of data-numerical, textual, and visual-to accurately analyze the financial market. Its unique dual-level reflection module not only enables rapid adaptation to market dynamics but also incorporates a diversified memory retrieval system, enhancing the agent's ability to learn from historical data and improve decision-making processes. The agent's emphasis on reasoning for actions fosters trust in its financial decisions. Moreover, FinAgent integrates established trading strategies and expert insights, ensuring that its trading approaches are both data-driven and rooted in sound financial principles. With comprehensive experiments on 6 financial datasets, including stocks and Crypto, FinAgent significantly outperforms 9 state-of-the-art baselines in terms of 6 financial metrics with over 36% average improvement on profit. Specifically, a 92.27% return (a 84.39% relative improvement) is achieved on one dataset. Notably, FinAgent is the first advanced multimodal foundation agent designed for financial trading tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards a clinically accessible radiology foundation model: open-access and lightweight, with automated evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08002v5)** | 2024-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scaling laws and extraordinary performance of large foundation models motivate the development and utilization of such models in biomedicine. However, despite early promising results on some biomedical benchmarks, there are still major challenges that need to be addressed before these models can be used in real-world clinics. Frontier general-domain models such as GPT-4V still have significant performance gaps in multimodal biomedical applications. More importantly, less-acknowledged pragmatic issues, including accessibility, model cost, and tedious manual evaluation make it hard for clinicians to use state-of-the-art large models directly on private patient data. Here, we explore training open-source small multimodal models (SMMs) to bridge competency gaps for unmet clinical needs in radiology. To maximize data efficiency, we adopt a modular approach by incorporating state-of-the-art pre-trained models for image and text modalities, and focusing on training a lightweight adapter to ground each modality to the text embedding space, as exemplified by LLaVA-Med. For training, we assemble a large dataset of over 697 thousand radiology image-text pairs. For evaluation, we propose CheXprompt, a GPT-4-based metric for factuality evaluation, and demonstrate its parity with expert evaluation. For best practice, we conduct a systematic ablation study on various choices in data engineering and multimodal training. The resulting LlaVA-Rad (7B) model attains state-of-the-art results on standard radiology tasks such as report generation and cross-modal retrieval, even outperforming much larger models such as GPT-4V and Med-PaLM M (84B). The inference of LlaVA-Rad is fast and can be performed on a single V100 GPU in private settings, offering a promising state-of-the-art tool for real-world clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

S-1's wave mode (WV) captures 20x20 km image patches at 5 m pixel resolution and is unaffected by cloud cover or time-of-day. The mission's open data policy has made SAR data easily accessible for a range of applications, but the need for manual image annotations is a bottleneck that hinders the use of machine learning methods. This study uses nearly 10 million WV-mode images and contrastive self-supervised learning to train a semantic embedding model called WV-Net. In multiple downstream tasks, WV-Net outperforms a comparable model that was pre-trained on natural images (ImageNet) with supervised learning. Experiments show improvements for estimating wave height (0.50 vs 0.60 RMSE using linear probing), estimating near-surface air temperature (0.90 vs 0.97 RMSE), and performing multilabel-classification of geophysical and atmospheric phenomena (0.96 vs 0.95 micro-averaged AUROC). WV-Net embeddings are also superior in an unsupervised image-retrieval task and scale better in data-sparse settings. Together, these results demonstrate that WV-Net embeddings can support geophysical research by providing a convenient foundation model for a variety of data analysis and exploration tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 9 figures, submitted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Given a collection of observed temporal graphs, is it possible to predict the evolution of an unseen network from the same domain? To answer this question, we first present the Temporal Graph Scaling (TGS) dataset, a large collection of temporal graphs consisting of eighty-four ERC20 token transaction networks collected from 2017 to 2023. Next, we evaluate the transferability of Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for the temporal graph property prediction task by pre-training on a collection of up to sixty-four token transaction networks and then evaluating the downstream performance on twenty unseen token networks. We find that the neural scaling law observed in NLP and Computer Vision also applies in temporal graph learning, where pre-training on greater number of networks leads to improved downstream performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of the transferability of temporal graphs learning. On downstream token networks, the largest pre-trained model outperforms single model TGNNs on thirteen unseen test networks. Therefore, we believe that this is a promising first step towards building foundation models for temporal graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 15 figures, preprint version</p></details> |

We focus on the specific Computer Vision application of Foundation Models for Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial AI. These models can solve important problems we are tackling, including for example land cover classification, crop type mapping, flood segmentation, building density estimation, and road regression segmentation. In this paper, we show that for a limited number of labelled data, Foundation Models achieve improved performance compared to problem-specific models. In this work, we also present our proposed evaluation benchmark for Foundation Models for EO. Benchmarking the generalization performance of Foundation Models is important as it has become difficult to standardize a fair comparison across the many different models that have been proposed recently. We present the results using our evaluation benchmark for EO Foundation Models and show that Foundation Models are label efficient in the downstream tasks and help us solve problems we are tackling in EO and remote sensing.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Submitted</p></details> |

Specifically for gastric cancer (GC), chronic inflammation causes changes in the mucosa such as atrophy, intestinal metaplasia (IM), dysplasia and ultimately cancer. Early detection through endoscopic regular surveillance is essential for better outcomes. Foundation models (FM), which are machine or deep learning models trained on diverse data and applicable to broad use cases, offer a promising solution to enhance the accuracy of endoscopy and its subsequent pathology image analysis. This review explores the recent advancements, applications, and challenges associated with FM in endoscopy and pathology imaging. We started by elucidating the core principles and architectures underlying these models, including their training methodologies and the pivotal role of large-scale data in developing their predictive capabilities. Moreover, this work discusses emerging trends and future research directions, emphasizing the integration of multimodal data, the development of more robust and equitable models, and the potential for real-time diagnostic support. This review aims to provide a roadmap for researchers and practitioners in navigating the complexities of incorporating FM into clinical practice for prevention/management of GC cases, thereby improving patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Automating these tasks allows to scale the analyses wrt. speed and breadth of content covered and decreases the manual effort required. Due to technical advancements in Natural Language Processing, specifically the success of large foundation models, a new tool for automating such annotation processes by using a text-to-text interface given written guidelines without providing training samples has become available. In this work, we assess these advancements in-the-wild by empirically testing them in an annotation task on German Twitter data about social and political European crises. We compare the prompt-based results with our human annotation and preceding classification approaches, including Naive Bayes and a BERT-based fine-tuning/domain adaptation pipeline. Our results show that the prompt-based approach - despite being limited by local computation resources during the model selection - is comparable with the fine-tuned BERT but without any annotated training data. Our findings emphasize the ongoing paradigm shift in the NLP landscape, i.e., the unification of downstream tasks and elimination of the need for pre-labeled training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |

Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be functional, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle toward developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learns the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking, GenRL exhibits strong multi-task generalization performance in several locomotion and manipulation domains. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free RL strategy, it lays the groundwork for foundation model-based RL for generalist embodied agents.</p></details> |  |

To help shape responsible development practices, we introduce the Foundation Model Development Cheatsheet: a growing collection of 250+ tools and resources spanning text, vision, and speech modalities. We draw on a large body of prior work to survey resources (e.g. software, documentation, frameworks, guides, and practical tools) that support informed data selection, processing, and understanding, precise and limitation-aware artifact documentation, efficient model training, advance awareness of the environmental impact from training, careful model evaluation of capabilities, risks, and claims, as well as responsible model release, licensing and deployment practices. We hope this curated collection of resources helps guide more responsible development. The process of curating this list, enabled us to review the AI development ecosystem, revealing what tools are critically missing, misused, or over-used in existing practices. We find that (i) tools for data sourcing, model evaluation, and monitoring are critically under-serving ethical and real-world needs, (ii) evaluations for model safety, capabilities, and environmental impact all lack reproducibility and transparency, (iii) text and particularly English-centric analyses continue to dominate over multilingual and multi-modal analyses, and (iv) evaluation of systems, rather than just models, is needed so that capabilities and impact are assessed in context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Training-free Open-world Segmentation via Image Prompt Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10912v3)** | 2024-06-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The realm of computer vision has witnessed a paradigm shift with the advent of foundational models, mirroring the transformative influence of large language models in the domain of natural language processing. This paper delves into the exploration of open-world segmentation, presenting a novel approach called Image Prompt Segmentation (IPSeg) that harnesses the power of vision foundational models. IPSeg lies the principle of a training-free paradigm, which capitalizes on image prompt techniques. Specifically, IPSeg utilizes a single image containing a subjective visual concept as a flexible prompt to query vision foundation models like DINOv2 and Stable Diffusion. Our approach extracts robust features for the prompt image and input image, then matches the input representations to the prompt representations via a novel feature interaction module to generate point prompts highlighting target objects in the input image. The generated point prompts are further utilized to guide the Segment Anything Model to segment the target object in the input image. The proposed method stands out by eliminating the need for exhaustive training sessions, thereby offering a more efficient and scalable solution. Experiments on COCO, PASCAL VOC, and other datasets demonstrate IPSeg's efficacy for flexible open-world segmentation using intuitive image prompts. This work pioneers tapping foundation models for open-world understanding through visual concepts conveyed in images.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by IJCV2024</p></details> |

However, collecting, preprocessing, and annotating multi-temporal remote sensing images at scale is non-trivial since it is expensive and knowledge-intensive. In this paper, we present change data generators based on generative models, which are cheap and automatic, alleviating these data problems. Our main idea is to simulate a stochastic change process over time. We describe the stochastic change process as a probabilistic graphical model (GPCM), which factorizes the complex simulation problem into two more tractable sub-problems, i.e., change event simulation and semantic change synthesis. To solve these two problems, we present Changen2, a GPCM with a resolution-scalable diffusion transformer which can generate time series of images and their semantic and change labels from labeled or unlabeled single-temporal images. Changen2 is a generative change foundation model that can be trained at scale via self-supervision, and can produce change supervisory signals from unlabeled single-temporal images. Unlike existing foundation models, Changen2 synthesizes change data to train task-specific foundation models for change detection. The resulting model possesses inherent zero-shot change detection capabilities and excellent transferability. Experiments suggest Changen2 has superior spatiotemporal scalability, e.g., Changen2 model trained on 256$^2$ pixel single-temporal images can yield time series of any length and resolutions of 1,024$^2$ pixels. Changen2 pre-trained models exhibit superior zero-shot performance (narrowing the performance gap to 3% on LEVIR-CD and approximately 10% on both S2Looking and SECOND, compared to fully supervised counterparts) and transferability across multiple types of change tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The enhanced extension of our ICCV 2023 (Changen)</p></details> |

We present the formalism for a generic as well as a set of common types of DBNs for particular variable distributions. We present the analytical form of the models, with a comprehensive discussion on the interdependence between structure and weights in a DBN model and their implications for learning. Next, we give a broad overview of learning methods and describe and categorize them based on the most important statistical features, and how they treat the interplay between learning structure and weights. We give the analytical form of the likelihood and Bayesian score functions, emphasizing the distinction from the static case. We discuss functions used in optimization to enforce structural requirements. We briefly discuss more complex extensions and representations. Finally we present a set of comparisons in different settings for various distinct but representative algorithms across the variants.</p></details> |  |

However, integrating these models into the creative process can be challenging as they often exist as standalone applications tailored to specific tasks. To address this challenge, we introduce Jigsaw, a prototype system that employs puzzle pieces as metaphors to represent foundation models. Jigsaw allows designers to combine different foundation model capabilities across various modalities by assembling compatible puzzle pieces. To inform the design of Jigsaw, we interviewed ten designers and distilled design goals. In a user study, we showed that Jigsaw enhanced designers' understanding of available foundation model capabilities, provided guidance on combining capabilities across different modalities and tasks, and served as a canvas to support design exploration, prototyping, and documentation.</p></details> | https://jigsaw.to |

Given these properties, they are a natural fit for active learning (AL), which aims to maximize labeling efficiency. However, the full potential of foundation models has not been explored in the context of AL, specifically in the low-budget regime. In this work, we evaluate how foundation models influence three critical components of effective AL, namely, 1) initial labeled pool selection, 2) ensuring diverse sampling, and 3) the trade-off between representative and uncertainty sampling. We systematically study how the robust representations of foundation models (DINOv2, OpenCLIP) challenge existing findings in active learning. Our observations inform the principled construction of a new simple and elegant AL strategy that balances uncertainty estimated via dropout with sample diversity. We extensively test our strategy on many challenging image classification benchmarks, including natural images as well as out-of-domain biomedical images that are relatively understudied in the AL literature. We also provide a highly performant and efficient implementation of modern AL strategies (including our method) at https://github.com/sanketx/AL-foundation-models.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic knowledge to guide practitioners in designing the agents considering challenges of goal-seeking (including generating instrumental goals and plans), such as hallucinations inherent in foundation models, explainability of reasoning process, complex accountability, etc. To address this issue, we have performed a systematic literature review to understand the state-of-the-art foundation model-based agents and the broader ecosystem. In this paper, we present a pattern catalogue consisting of 17 architectural patterns with analyses of the context, forces, and trade-offs as the outcomes from the previous literature review. The proposed catalogue can provide holistic guidance for the effective use of patterns, and support the architecture design of foundation model-based agents by facilitating goal-seeking and plan generation.</p></details> |  |

For foundation models trained on unknown Web data, MI attacks can be used to detect copyrighted training materials, measure test set contamination, or audit machine unlearning. Unfortunately, we find that evaluations of MI attacks for foundation models are flawed, because they sample members and non-members from different distributions. For 8 published MI evaluation datasets, we show that blind attacks -- that distinguish the member and non-member distributions without looking at any trained model -- outperform state-of-the-art MI attacks. Existing evaluations thus tell us nothing about membership leakage of a foundation model's training data.</p></details> |  |

The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse. However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (~136K samples, 440 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health. The system is accessible from https://github.com/evelyn0414/OPERA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness of the Foundational Models for Q&A Classification in Mental Health care](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15966v1)** | 2024-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have the potential to transform mental health support by providing accessible and culturally sensitive resources. However, despite this potential, their effectiveness in mental health care and specifically for the Arabic language has not been extensively explored. To bridge this gap, this study evaluates the effectiveness of foundational models for classification of Questions and Answers (Q&A) in the domain of mental health care. We leverage the MentalQA dataset, an Arabic collection featuring Q&A interactions related to mental health. In this study, we conducted experiments using four different types of learning approaches: traditional feature extraction, PLMs as feature extractors, Fine-tuning PLMs and prompting large language models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) in zero-shot and few-shot learning settings. While traditional feature extractors combined with Support Vector Machines (SVM) showed promising performance, PLMs exhibited even better results due to their ability to capture semantic meaning. For example, MARBERT achieved the highest performance with a Jaccard Score of 0.80 for question classification and a Jaccard Score of 0.86 for answer classification. We further conducted an in-depth analysis including examining the effects of fine-tuning versus non-fine-tuning, the impact of varying data size, and conducting error analysis. Our analysis demonstrates that fine-tuning proved to be beneficial for enhancing the performance of PLMs, and the size of the training data played a crucial role in achieving high performance. We also explored prompting, where few-shot learning with GPT-3.5 yielded promising results. There was an improvement of 12% for question and classification and 45% for answer classification. Based on our findings, it can be concluded that PLMs and prompt-based approaches hold promise for mental health support in Arabic.</p></details> |  |

As such, there is interest in leveraging AI for automatic, objective assessments of clinical speech to facilitate diagnosis and treatment of speech disorders. We explore transfer learning using foundation models, focusing on the impact of layer selection for the downstream task of predicting pathological speech features. We find that selecting an optimal layer can greatly improve performance (~15.8% increase in balanced accuracy per feature as compared to worst layer, ~13.6% increase as compared to final layer), though the best layer varies by predicted feature and does not always generalize well to unseen data. A learned weighted sum offers comparable performance to the average best layer in-distribution (only ~1.2% lower) and had strong generalization for out-of-distribution data (only 1.5% lower than the average best layer).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |

Despite the recent progress made in learning to solve individual VRP variants, there is a lack of a unified approach that can effectively tackle a wide range of tasks, which is crucial for real-world impact. This paper introduces RouteFinder, a framework for developing foundation models for VRPs. Our key idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to model variants by treating each variant as a subset of a larger VRP problem, equipped with different attributes. We introduce a parallelized environment that can handle any combination of attributes at the same time in a batched manner, and an efficient sampling procedure to train on a mix of problems at each optimization step that can greatly improve convergence robustness. We also introduce novel Global Feature Embeddings that project instance-wise attributes efficiently onto the latent space and help the model understand different VRP variants. Finally, we introduce Efficient Adapter Layers, a simple yet effective technique to finetune pre-trained RouteFinder models to solve novel variants with previously unseen attributes outside of the original feature space.

Recent foundation models like GroundingDINO and Segment Anything (SAM) provide opportunities to automatically generate annotations. This study introduces FMARS (Foundation Model Annotations in Remote Sensing), a methodology leveraging VHR imagery and foundation models for fast and robust annotation. We focus on disaster management and provide a large-scale dataset with labels obtained from pre-event imagery over 19 disaster events, derived from the Maxar Open Data initiative. We train segmentation models on the generated labels, using Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) techniques to increase transferability to real-world scenarios. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of leveraging foundation models to automatically annotate remote sensing data at scale, enabling robust downstream models for critical applications.

| **[BiPFT: Binary Pre-trained Foundation Transformer with Low-rank Estimation of Binarization Residual Polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08937v2)** | 2024-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained foundation models offer substantial benefits for a wide range of downstream tasks, which can be one of the most potential techniques to access artificial general intelligence. However, scaling up foundation transformers for maximal task-agnostic knowledge has brought about computational challenges, especially on resource-limited devices such as mobiles. This work proposes the first Binary Pretrained Foundation Transformer (BiPFT) for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks, which remarkably saves 56 times operations and 28 times memory. In contrast to previous task-specific binary transformers, BiPFT exhibits a substantial enhancement in the learning capabilities of binary neural networks (BNNs), promoting BNNs into the era of pre-training. Benefiting from extensive pretraining data, we further propose a data-driven binarization method. Specifically, we first analyze the binarization error in self-attention operations and derive the polynomials of binarization error. To simulate full-precision self-attention, we define binarization error as binarization residual polynomials, and then introduce low-rank estimators to model these polynomials. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BiPFTs, surpassing task-specific baseline by 15.4% average performance on the GLUE benchmark. BiPFT also demonstrates improved robustness to hyperparameter changes, improved optimization efficiency, and reduced reliance on downstream distillation, which consequently generalize on various NLU tasks and simplify the downstream pipeline of BNNs. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at https://github.com/Xingrun-Xing/BiPFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Multimodal Foundation Models Understand Enterprise Workflows? A Benchmark for Business Process Management Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13264v1)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing ML benchmarks lack the depth and diversity of annotations needed for evaluating models on business process management (BPM) tasks. BPM is the practice of documenting, measuring, improving, and automating enterprise workflows. However, research has focused almost exclusively on one task - full end-to-end automation using agents based on multimodal foundation models (FMs) like GPT-4. This focus on automation ignores the reality of how most BPM tools are applied today - simply documenting the relevant workflow takes 60% of the time of the typical process optimization project. To address this gap we present WONDERBREAD, the first benchmark for evaluating multimodal FMs on BPM tasks beyond automation. Our contributions are: (1) a dataset containing 2928 documented workflow demonstrations; (2) 6 novel BPM tasks sourced from real-world applications ranging from workflow documentation to knowledge transfer to process improvement; and (3) an automated evaluation harness. Our benchmark shows that while state-of-the-art FMs can automatically generate documentation (e.g. recalling 88% of the steps taken in a video demonstration of a workflow), they struggle to re-apply that knowledge towards finer-grained validation of workflow completion (F1 < 0.3). We hope WONDERBREAD encourages the development of more "human-centered" AI tooling for enterprise applications and furthers the exploration of multimodal FMs for the broader universe of BPM tasks. We publish our dataset and experiments here: https://github.com/HazyResearch/wonderbread</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Conceptual Explainers: Trustworthy Conceptual Explanations for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12649v2)** | 2024-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Synergizing Foundation Models and Federated Learning: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12844v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of Foundation Models (FMs), represented by large language models, vision transformers, and multimodal models, has been making a significant impact on both academia and industry. Compared with small-scale models, FMs have a much stronger demand for high-volume data during the pre-training phase. Although general FMs can be pre-trained on data collected from open sources such as the Internet, domain-specific FMs need proprietary data, posing a practical challenge regarding the amount of data available due to privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) is a collaborative learning paradigm that breaks the barrier of data availability from different participants. Therefore, it provides a promising solution to customize and adapt FMs to a wide range of domain-specific tasks using distributed datasets whilst preserving privacy. This survey paper discusses the potentials and challenges of synergizing FL and FMs and summarizes core techniques, future directions, and applications. A periodically updated paper collection on FM-FL is available at https://github.com/lishenghui/awesome-fm-fl.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Mathematics of Dots and Pixels: On the Theoretical Foundations of Image Halftoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12760v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of image halftoning, from its analog roots to contemporary digital methodologies, encapsulates a fascinating journey marked by technological advancements and creative innovations. Yet the theoretical understanding of halftoning is much more recent. In this article, we explore various approaches towards shedding light on the design of halftoning approaches and why they work. We discuss both halftoning in a continuous domain and on a pixel grid. We start by reviewing the mathematical foundation of the so-called electrostatic halftoning method, which departed from the heuristic of considering the back dots of the halftoned image as charged particles attracted by the grey values of the image in combination with mutual repulsion. Such an attraction-repulsion model can be mathematically represented via an energy functional in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space allowing for a rigorous analysis of the resulting optimization problem as well as a convergence analysis in a suitable topology. A second class of methods that we discuss in detail is the class of error diffusion schemes, arguably among the most popular halftoning techniques due to their ability to work directly on a pixel grid and their ease of application. The main idea of these schemes is to choose the locations of the black pixels via a recurrence relation designed to agree with the image in terms of the local averages. We discuss some recent mathematical understanding of these methods that is based on a connection to Sigma-Delta quantizers, a popular class of algorithms for analog-to-digital conversion.</p></details> | 27 pages, 6 figures |

However, given its unstructured graph representation, the direct generation of high-fidelity 3D meshes is challenging. Fortunately, with a pre-defined ordering strategy, 3D meshes can be represented as sequences, and the generation process can be seamlessly treated as an auto-regressive problem. In this paper, we validate the Neural Coordinate Field (NeurCF), an explicit coordinate representation with implicit neural embeddings, is a simple-yet-effective representation for large-scale sequential mesh modeling. After that, we present MeshXL, a family of generative pre-trained auto-regressive models, which addresses the process of 3D mesh generation with modern large language model approaches. Extensive experiments show that MeshXL is able to generate high-quality 3D meshes, and can also serve as foundation models for various down-stream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on the Fairness of Foundation Models for Multi-Organ Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12646v1)** | 2024-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The segmentation foundation model, e.g., Segment Anything Model (SAM), has attracted increasing interest in the medical image community. Early pioneering studies primarily concentrated on assessing and improving SAM's performance from the perspectives of overall accuracy and efficiency, yet little attention was given to the fairness considerations. This oversight raises questions about the potential for performance biases that could mirror those found in task-specific deep learning models like nnU-Net. In this paper, we explored the fairness dilemma concerning large segmentation foundation models. We prospectively curate a benchmark dataset of 3D MRI and CT scans of the organs including liver, kidney, spleen, lung and aorta from a total of 1056 healthy subjects with expert segmentations. Crucially, we document demographic details such as gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) for each subject to facilitate a nuanced fairness analysis. We test state-of-the-art foundation models for medical image segmentation, including the original SAM, medical SAM and SAT models, to evaluate segmentation efficacy across different demographic groups and identify disparities. Our comprehensive analysis, which accounts for various confounding factors, reveals significant fairness concerns within these foundational models. Moreover, our findings highlight not only disparities in overall segmentation metrics, such as the Dice Similarity Coefficient but also significant variations in the spatial distribution of segmentation errors, offering empirical evidence of the nuanced challenges in ensuring fairness in medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI-2024</p></details> |

Recent advances in Foundation Models (FMs) have fundamentally reshaped the paradigm of model design for time series analysis, boosting various downstream tasks in practice. These innovative approaches often leverage pre-trained or fine-tuned FMs to harness generalized knowledge tailored for time series analysis. This survey aims to furnish a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for time series analysis. While prior surveys have predominantly focused on either application or pipeline aspects of FMs in time series analysis, they have often lacked an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that elucidate why and how FMs benefit time series analysis. To address this gap, our survey adopts a methodology-centric classification, delineating various pivotal elements of time-series FMs, including model architectures, pre-training techniques, adaptation methods, and data modalities. Overall, this survey serves to consolidate the latest advancements in FMs pertinent to time series analysis, accentuating their theoretical underpinnings, recent strides in development, and avenues for future exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 30th ACM SIGKDD Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD'24)</p></details> |

This reduces the need for extensive labeled datasets for each new task, saving both time and resources by leveraging the broad knowledge base established during pretraining. Most research on FMs has primarily focused on unstructured data, such as text and images, or semi-structured data, like time-series. However, there has been limited attention to structured data, such as tabular data, which, despite its prevalence, remains under-studied due to a lack of clean datasets and insufficient research on the transferability of FMs for various tabular data tasks. In response to this gap, we introduce a framework called TabularFM, which incorporates state-of-the-art methods for developing FMs specifically for tabular data. This includes variations of neural architectures such as GANs, VAEs, and Transformers. We have curated a million of tabular datasets and released cleaned versions to facilitate the development of tabular FMs. We pretrained FMs on this curated data, benchmarked various learning methods on these datasets, and released the pretrained models along with leaderboards for future comparative studies. Our fully open-sourced system provides a comprehensive analysis of the transferability of tabular FMs. By releasing these datasets, pretrained models, and leaderboards, we aim to enhance the validity and usability of tabular FMs in the near future.</p></details> |  |

We developed a foundation model with uncertainty estimation (FMUE) to detect 11 retinal conditions on optical coherence tomography (OCT). In the internal test set, FMUE achieved a higher F1 score of 96.76% than two state-of-the-art algorithms, RETFound and UIOS, and got further improvement with thresholding strategy to 98.44%. In the external test sets obtained from other OCT devices, FMUE achieved an accuracy of 88.75% and 92.73% before and after thresholding. Our model is superior to two ophthalmologists with a higher F1 score (95.17% vs. 61.93% &71.72%). Besides, our model correctly predicts high uncertainty scores for samples with ambiguous features, of non-target-category diseases, or with low-quality to prompt manual checks and prevent misdiagnosis. FMUE provides a trustworthy method for automatic retinal anomalies detection in the real-world clinical open set environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All codes are available at https://github.com/yuanyuanpeng0129/FMUE</p></details> |

However, on specific datasets, VLM may encounter the problem where the detected targets are misaligned with the target concepts of interest. This misalignment hinders the zero-shot performance of VLM and the application of fine-tuning methods based on pseudo-labels. To address this issue, we propose the VLM+ framework, which integrates the multimodal large language model (MM-LLM). Specifically, we use MM-LLM to generate a series of referential expressions for each category. Based on the VLM predictions and the given annotations, we select the best referential expression for each category by matching the maximum IoU. Subsequently, we use these referential expressions to generate pseudo-labels for all images in the training set and then combine them with the original labeled data to fine-tune the VLM. Additionally, we employ iterative pseudo-label generation and optimization to further enhance the performance of the VLM. Our approach achieve 32.56 mAP in the final test.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR2...</summary><p>CVPR2024 Foundational Few-Shot Object Detection Challenge</p></details> |

Our method is a generalizable feedforward model that predicts a rich neural scene representation from sparse, single-frame multi-view camera inputs, and is trained self-supervised with differentiable rendering to reconstruct RGB, depth, or feature images. Our first insight is to exploit per-scene optimized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by generating dense depth and virtual camera targets for training, thereby helping our model to learn 3D geometry from sparse non-overlapping image inputs. Second, to learn a semantically rich 3D representation, we propose distilling features from pre-trained 2D foundation models, such as CLIP or DINOv2, thereby enabling various downstream tasks without the need for costly 3D human annotations. To leverage these two insights, we introduce a novel model architecture with a two-stage lift-splat-shoot encoder and a parameterized sparse hierarchical voxel representation. Experimental results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that DistillNeRF significantly outperforms existing comparable self-supervised methods for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth estimation; and it allows for competitive zero-shot 3D semantic occupancy prediction, as well as open-world scene understanding through distilled foundation model features.

We propose an Interactive Agent Foundation Model that uses a novel multi-task agent training paradigm for training AI agents across a wide range of domains, datasets, and tasks. Our training paradigm unifies diverse pre-training strategies, including visual masked auto-encoders, language modeling, and next-action prediction, enabling a versatile and adaptable AI framework. We demonstrate the performance of our framework across three separate domains -- Robotics, Gaming AI, and Healthcare. Our model demonstrates its ability to generate meaningful and contextually relevant outputs in each area. The strength of our approach lies in its generality, leveraging a variety of data sources such as robotics sequences, gameplay data, large-scale video datasets, and textual information for effective multimodal and multi-task learning. Our approach provides a promising avenue for developing generalist, action-taking, multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |

However, hyperspectral images (HSIs), which are rich in spectral information, have not seen much application of FMs, with existing methods often restricted to specific tasks and lacking generality. To fill this gap, we introduce HyperSIGMA, a vision transformer-based foundation model for HSI interpretation, scalable to over a billion parameters. To tackle the spectral and spatial redundancy challenges in HSIs, we introduce a novel sparse sampling attention (SSA) mechanism, which effectively promotes the learning of diverse contextual features and serves as the basic block of HyperSIGMA. HyperSIGMA integrates spatial and spectral features using a specially designed spectral enhancement module. In addition, we construct a large-scale hyperspectral dataset, HyperGlobal-450K, for pre-training, which contains about 450K hyperspectral images, significantly surpassing existing datasets in scale. Extensive experiments on various high-level and low-level HSI tasks demonstrate HyperSIGMA's versatility and superior representational capability compared to current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, HyperSIGMA shows significant advantages in scalability, robustness, cross-modal transferring capability, and real-world applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and models will be released at https://github.com/WHU-Sigma/HyperSIGMA</p></details> |

This challenge is important in safety-critical applications, where deep-neural-network-based systems must perform reliably under various environmental conditions not seen during training. Our study investigates whether the generalization capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods for the semantic segmentation task are complementary. Results show that combining VFMs with UDA has two main benefits: (a) it allows for better UDA performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution performance of VFMs, and (b) it makes certain time-consuming UDA components redundant, thus enabling significant inference speedups. Specifically, with equivalent model sizes, the resulting VFM-UDA method achieves an 8.4$\times$ speed increase over the prior non-VFM state of the art, while also improving performance by +1.2 mIoU in the UDA setting and by +6.1 mIoU in terms of out-of-distribution generalization. Moreover, when we use a VFM with 3.6$\times$ more parameters, the VFM-UDA approach maintains a 3.3$\times$ speed up, while improving the UDA performance by +3.1 mIoU and the out-of-distribution performance by +10.3 mIoU. These results underscore the significant benefits of combining VFMs with UDA, setting new standards and baselines for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 Workshop Proceedings for the Second Workshop on Foundation Models</p></details> |

Such models usually adopt an encoder-decoder or decoder-only architecture due to their popularity and good performance in many domains. However, autoregressive models can be slower during inference compared to non-autoregressive models and also have potential risks of hallucination. Though prior studies observed promising results of non-autoregressive models for certain tasks at small scales, it remains unclear if they can be scaled to speech-to-text generation in diverse languages and tasks. Inspired by the Open Whisper-style Speech Model (OWSM) project, we propose OWSM-CTC, a novel encoder-only speech foundation model based on Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC). It is trained on 180k hours of public audio data for multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR), speech translation (ST), and language identification (LID). Compared to encoder-decoder OWSM, our OWSM-CTC achieves competitive results on ASR and up to 24% relative improvement on ST, while it is more robust and 3 to 4 times faster for inference. OWSM-CTC also improves the long-form ASR result with 20x speed-up.

Recently, SAM has gained a great deal of attention for its applications in medical image segmentation. However, to our best knowledge, no studies have shown how to harness the power of SAM for medical image classification. To fill this gap and make SAM a true ``foundation model'' for medical image analysis, it is highly desirable to customize SAM specifically for medical image classification. In this paper, we introduce SAMAug-C, an innovative augmentation method based on SAM for augmenting classification datasets by generating variants of the original images. The augmented datasets can be used to train a deep learning classification model, thereby boosting the classification performance. Furthermore, we propose a novel framework that simultaneously processes raw and SAMAug-C augmented image input, capitalizing on the complementary information that is offered by both. Experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of our new approach.</p></details> |  |

Temperature Network Meets Large Foundation Models via DRO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04575v3)** | 2024-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The temperature parameter plays a profound role during training and/or inference with large foundation models (LFMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and CLIP models. Particularly, it adjusts the logits in the softmax function in LLMs, which is crucial for next token generation, and it scales the similarities in the contrastive loss for training CLIP models. A significant question remains: Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of any input data for enhancing LFMs"? In this paper, we present a principled framework for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet) to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with a robust loss underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks. Our experiments on LLMs and CLIP models demonstrate that TempNet greatly improves the performance of existing solutions or models, e.g. Table 1.

A major obstacle to achieving this goal stems from the fact that graphs from different domains often exhibit diverse node features. Inspired by multi-modal models that align different modalities with natural language, the text has recently been adopted to provide a unified feature space for diverse graphs. Despite the great potential of these text-space GFMs, current research in this field is hampered by two problems. First, the absence of a comprehensive benchmark with unified problem settings hinders a clear understanding of the comparative effectiveness and practical value of different text-space GFMs. Second, there is a lack of sufficient datasets to thoroughly explore the methods' full potential and verify their effectiveness across diverse settings.

These systems extract relevant signal features and generate informative representations for particular tasks. However, building the feature extraction component for such systems requires extensive domain-specific expertise or data. The exceptionally rapid development of foundation models is likely to usher in newfound abilities in such intelligent sensing. We propose a new scheme for sensing model, which we refer to as semi-generalist sensing model (SGSM). SGSM is able to semiautomatically solve various tasks using relatively less task-specific labeled data compared to traditional systems. Built through the analysis of the common theoretical model, SGSM can depict different modalities, such as the acoustic and Wi-Fi signal. Experimental results on such two heterogeneous sensors illustrate that SGSM functions across a wide range of scenarios, thereby establishing its broad applicability. In some cases, SGSM even achieves better performance than sensor-specific specialized solutions. Wi-Fi evaluations indicate a 20\% accuracy improvement when applying SGSM to an existing sensing model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Adapt Foundation Model DINOv2 for Capsule Endoscopy Diagnosis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10508v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have become prominent in computer vision, achieving notable success in various tasks. However, their effectiveness largely depends on pre-training with extensive datasets. Applying foundation models directly to small datasets of capsule endoscopy images from scratch is challenging. Pre-training on broad, general vision datasets is crucial for successfully fine-tuning our model for specific tasks. In this work, we introduce a simplified approach called Adapt foundation models with a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique for easier customization. Our method, inspired by the DINOv2 foundation model, applies low-rank adaptation learning to tailor foundation models for capsule endoscopy diagnosis effectively. Unlike traditional fine-tuning methods, our strategy includes LoRA layers designed to absorb specific surgical domain knowledge. During the training process, we keep the main model (the backbone encoder) fixed and focus on optimizing the LoRA layers and the disease classification component. We tested our method on two publicly available datasets for capsule endoscopy disease classification. The results were impressive, with our model achieving 97.75% accuracy on the Kvasir-Capsule dataset and 98.81% on the Kvasirv2 dataset. Our solution demonstrates that foundation models can be adeptly adapted for capsule endoscopy diagnosis, highlighting that mere reliance on straightforward fine-tuning or pre-trained models from general computer vision tasks is inadequate for such specific applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICBIR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Children's ASR with Supervised and Self-supervised Speech Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10507v1)** | 2024-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech foundation models (SFMs) have achieved state-of-the-art results for various speech tasks in supervised (e.g. Whisper) or self-supervised systems (e.g. WavLM). However, the performance of SFMs for child ASR has not been systematically studied. In addition, there is no benchmark for child ASR with standard evaluations, making the comparisons of novel ideas difficult. In this paper, we initiate and present a comprehensive benchmark on several child speech databases based on various SFMs (Whisper, Wav2vec2.0, HuBERT, and WavLM). Moreover, we investigate finetuning strategies by comparing various data augmentation and parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) methods. We observe that the behaviors of these methods are different when the model size increases. For example, PEFT matches the performance of full finetuning for large models but worse for small models. To stabilize finetuning using augmented data, we propose a perturbation invariant finetuning (PIF) loss as a regularization.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Interspeech 2024</p></details> |

However, this openness has also enabled the development of highly-capable, unsafe models, as exemplified by recent instances such as WormGPT and FraudGPT, which are specifically designed to facilitate criminal activity. As the capabilities of open foundation models continue to grow, potentially outpacing those of closed-source models, the risk of misuse by bad actors poses an increasingly serious threat to society. This paper addresses the critical question of how open foundation model developers should approach model safety in light of these challenges. Our analysis reveals that open-source foundation model companies often provide less restrictive acceptable use policies (AUPs) compared to their closed-source counterparts, likely due to the inherent difficulties in enforcing such policies once the models are released. To tackle this issue, we introduce PRISM, a design framework for open-source foundation model safety that emphasizes Private, Robust, Independent Safety measures, at Minimal marginal cost of compute. The PRISM framework proposes the use of modular functions that moderate prompts and outputs independently of the core language model, offering a more adaptable and resilient approach to safety compared to the brittle reinforcement learning methods currently used for value alignment. By focusing on identifying AUP violations and engaging the developer community in establishing consensus around safety design decisions, PRISM aims to create a safer open-source ecosystem that maximizes the potential of these powerful technologies while minimizing the risks to individuals and society as a whole.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose RL-VLM-F, a method that automatically generates reward functions for agents to learn new tasks, using only a text description of the task goal and the agent's visual observations, by leveraging feedbacks from vision language foundation models (VLMs). The key to our approach is to query these models to give preferences over pairs of the agent's image observations based on the text description of the task goal, and then learn a reward function from the preference labels, rather than directly prompting these models to output a raw reward score, which can be noisy and inconsistent. We demonstrate that RL-VLM-F successfully produces effective rewards and policies across various domains - including classic control, as well as manipulation of rigid, articulated, and deformable objects - without the need for human supervision, outperforming prior methods that use large pretrained models for reward generation under the same assumptions.

This study introduces a novel approach towards the creation of medical foundation models by integrating a large-scale multi-modal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset derived from 41,400 participants in its own. Our method involves a novel two-stage pretraining approach using vision transformers. The first stage is dedicated to encoding anatomical structures in generally healthy brains, identifying key features such as shapes and sizes of different brain regions. The second stage concentrates on spatial information, encompassing aspects like location and the relative positioning of brain structures. We rigorously evaluate our model, BrainFounder, using the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge and Anatomical Tracings of Lesions After Stroke v2.0 (ATLAS v2.0) datasets. BrainFounder demonstrates a significant performance gain, surpassing the achievements of the previous winning solutions using fully supervised learning. Our findings underscore the impact of scaling up both the complexity of the model and the volume of unlabeled training data derived from generally healthy brains, which enhances the accuracy and predictive capabilities of the model in complex neuroimaging tasks with MRI. The implications of this research provide transformative insights and practical applications in healthcare and make substantial steps towards the creation of foundation models for Medical AI.

This new egocentric data comes equipped with fine-grained 3D location information and thus presents the opportunity for a novel class of spatial foundation models that are rooted in 3D space. To measure progress on what we term Egocentric Foundation Models (EFMs) we establish EFM3D, a benchmark with two core 3D egocentric perception tasks. EFM3D is the first benchmark for 3D object detection and surface regression on high quality annotated egocentric data of Project Aria. We propose Egocentric Voxel Lifting (EVL), a baseline for 3D EFMs. EVL leverages all available egocentric modalities and inherits foundational capabilities from 2D foundation models. This model, trained on a large simulated dataset, outperforms existing methods on the EFM3D benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Despite extensive research into self-supervised learning as the cornerstone of FMs, several outstanding issues persist in Graph Foundation Models that rely on graph self-supervised learning, namely: 1) Homogenization. The extent of generalization capability on downstream tasks remains unclear. 2) Scalability. It is unknown how effectively these models can scale to large datasets. 3) Efficiency. The training time and memory usage of these models require evaluation. 4) Training Stop Criteria. Determining the optimal stopping strategy for pre-training across multiple tasks to maximize performance on downstream tasks. To address these questions, we have constructed a rigorous benchmark that thoroughly analyzes and studies the generalization and scalability of self-supervised Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. Regarding generalization, we have implemented and compared the performance of various self-supervised GNN models, trained to generate node representations, across tasks such as node classification, link prediction, and node clustering. For scalability, we have compared the performance of various models after training using full-batch and mini-batch strategies. Additionally, we have assessed the training efficiency of these models by conducting experiments to test their GPU memory usage and throughput. Through these experiments, we aim to provide insights to motivate future research. The code for this benchmark is publicly available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/GraphFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Evaluation of Speech Foundation Models for Spoken Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10083v1)** | 2024-06-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Spoken Language Understanding Evaluation (SLUE) suite of benchmark tasks was recently introduced to address the need for open resources and benchmarking of complex spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks, including both classification and sequence generation tasks, on natural speech. The benchmark has demonstrated preliminary success in using pre-trained speech foundation models (SFM) for these SLU tasks. However, the community still lacks a fine-grained understanding of the comparative utility of different SFMs. Inspired by this, we ask: which SFMs offer the most benefits for these complex SLU tasks, and what is the most effective approach for incorporating these SFMs? To answer this, we perform an extensive evaluation of multiple supervised and self-supervised SFMs using several evaluation protocols: (i) frozen SFMs with a lightweight prediction head, (ii) frozen SFMs with a complex prediction head, and (iii) fine-tuned SFMs with a lightweight prediction head. Although the supervised SFMs are pre-trained on much more speech recognition data (with labels), they do not always outperform self-supervised SFMs; the latter tend to perform at least as well as, and sometimes better than, supervised SFMs, especially on the sequence generation tasks in SLUE. While there is no universally optimal way of incorporating SFMs, the complex prediction head gives the best performance for most tasks, although it increases the inference time. We also introduce an open-source toolkit and performance leaderboard, SLUE-PERB, for these tasks and modeling strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL Findings 2024</p></details> |

The models generalize well and perform outstandingly on everyday objects or scenes, even on downstream tasks, tasks the model has not been trained on, while the application in specialized domains, as in an industrial context, is still an open research question. Here, fine-tuning the models or transfer learning on domain-specific data is unavoidable when objecting to adequate performance. In this work, we, on the one hand, introduce a pipeline to generate the Industrial Language-Image Dataset (ILID) based on web-crawled data; on the other hand, we demonstrate effective self-supervised transfer learning and discussing downstream tasks after training on the cheaply acquired ILID, which does not necessitate human labeling or intervention. With the proposed approach, we contribute by transferring approaches from state-of-the-art research around foundation models, transfer learning strategies, and applications to the industrial domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset at https://github.com/kenomo/ilid training- and evaluation-related code at https://github.com/kenomo/industrial-clip</p></details> |

Feeding foundation models a regionally diverse food dataset of World Wide Dishes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09496v1)** | 2024-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are increasingly ubiquitous in our daily lives, used in everyday tasks such as text-image searches, interactions with chatbots, and content generation. As use increases, so does concern over the disparities in performance and fairness of these models for different people in different parts of the world. To assess these growing regional disparities, we present World Wide Dishes, a mixed text and image dataset consisting of 765 dishes, with dish names collected in 131 local languages. World Wide Dishes has been collected purely through human contribution and decentralised means, by creating a website widely distributed through social networks. Using the dataset, we demonstrate a novel means of operationalising capability and representational biases in foundation models such as language models and text-to-image generative models. We enrich these studies with a pilot community review to understand, from a first-person perspective, how these models generate images for people in five African countries and the United States. We find that these models generally do not produce quality text and image outputs of dishes specific to different regions. This is true even for the US, which is typically considered to be more well-resourced in training data - though the generation of US dishes does outperform that of the investigated African countries. The models demonstrate a propensity to produce outputs that are inaccurate as well as culturally misrepresentative, flattening, and insensitive. These failures in capability and representational bias have the potential to further reinforce stereotypes and disproportionately contribute to erasure based on region. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/oxai/world-wide-dishes/.</p></details> |  |

However, most methods rely on training with general image datasets, and the lack of geospatial data leads to poor performance on earth observation. Numerous geospatial image-text pair datasets and VLFMs fine-tuned on them have been proposed recently. These new approaches aim to leverage large-scale, multimodal geospatial data to build versatile intelligent models with diverse geo-perceptive capabilities, which we refer to as Vision-Language Geo-Foundation Models (VLGFMs). This paper thoroughly reviews VLGFMs, summarizing and analyzing recent developments in the field. In particular, we introduce the background and motivation behind the rise of VLGFMs, highlighting their unique research significance. Then, we systematically summarize the core technologies employed in VLGFMs, including data construction, model architectures, and applications of various multimodal geospatial tasks. Finally, we conclude with insights, issues, and discussions regarding future research directions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive literature review of VLGFMs. We keep tracing related works at https://github.com/zytx121/Awesome-VLGFM.</p></details> | 18 pages, 4 figures |

In this paper, we present a retinal vision-language foundation model (RetiZero) with knowledge of over 400 fundus diseases. Specifically, we collected 341,896 fundus images paired with text descriptions from 29 publicly available datasets, 180 ophthalmic books, and online resources, encompassing over 400 fundus diseases across multiple countries and ethnicities. RetiZero achieved outstanding performance across various downstream tasks, including zero-shot retinal disease recognition, image-to-image retrieval, internal domain and cross-domain retinal disease classification, and few-shot fine-tuning. Specially, in the zero-shot scenario, RetiZero achieved a Top5 score of 0.8430 and 0.7561 on 15 and 52 fundus diseases respectively. In the image-retrieval task, RetiZero achieved a Top5 score of 0.9500 and 0.8860 on 15 and 52 retinal diseases respectively. Furthermore, clinical evaluations by ophthalmology experts from different countries demonstrate that RetiZero can achieve performance comparable to experienced ophthalmologists using zero-shot and image retrieval methods without requiring model retraining. These capabilities of retinal disease identification strengthen our RetiZero foundation model in clinical implementation.</p></details> |  |

To this end, OWSM models are trained on 25 public speech datasets, which are heterogeneous in multiple ways. In this study, we advance the OWSM series by introducing OWSM v3.2, which improves on prior models by investigating and addressing the impacts of this data heterogeneity. Our study begins with a detailed analysis of each dataset, from which we derive two key strategies: data filtering with proxy task to enhance data quality, and the incorporation of punctuation and true-casing using an open large language model (LLM). With all other configurations staying the same, OWSM v3.2 improves performance over the OWSM v3.1 baseline while using 15% less training data.</p></details> |  |

However, creating such datasets remains challenging due to the complexity and heterogeneity of medical data. To address this challenge, we introduce HoneyBee, a scalable modular framework for building multimodal oncology datasets that leverages foundation models to generate representative embeddings. HoneyBee integrates various data modalities, including clinical diagnostic and pathology imaging data, medical notes, reports, records, and molecular data. It employs data preprocessing techniques and foundation models to generate embeddings that capture the essential features and relationships within the raw medical data. The generated embeddings are stored in a structured format using Hugging Face datasets and PyTorch dataloaders for accessibility. Vector databases enable efficient querying and retrieval for machine learning applications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HoneyBee through experiments assessing the quality and representativeness of these embeddings. The framework is designed to be extensible to other medical domains and aims to accelerate oncology research by providing high-quality, machine learning-ready datasets. HoneyBee is an ongoing open-source effort, and the code, datasets, and models are available at the project repository.</p></details> |  |

Experimental results on the Voice Conversion Challenge 2018 and 2020 datasets show that SVSNet+ incorporating WavLM representations shows significant improvements compared to baseline models. In addition, while fine-tuning WavLM with a small dataset of the downstream task does not improve performance, using the same dataset to learn a weighted-sum representation of WavLM can substantially improve performance. Furthermore, when WavLM is replaced by other SFMs, SVSNet+ still outperforms the baseline models and exhibits strong generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to INTERSPEECH 2024</p></details> |

To tackle this issue, researchers have developed various methods on disaster benchmark datasets from satellite imagery to aid in detecting disaster damage. However, the diverse nature of geographical landscapes and disasters makes it challenging to apply existing methods to regions unseen during training. We present DAVI (Disaster Assessment with VIsion foundation model), which overcomes domain disparities and detects structural damage (e.g., building) without requiring ground-truth labels of the target region. DAVI integrates task-specific knowledge from a model trained on source regions with an image segmentation foundation model to generate pseudo labels of possible damage in the target region. It then employs a two-stage refinement process, targeting both the pixel and overall image, to more accurately pinpoint changes in disaster-struck areas based on before-and-after images. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that DAVI achieves exceptional performance across diverse terrains (e.g., USA and Mexico) and disaster types (e.g., wildfires, hurricanes, and earthquakes). This confirms its robustness in assessing disaster impact without dependence on ground-truth labels.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, while many computational pathology approaches have been proposed, most current AI models are limited with respect to generalization, application variety, and handling rare diseases. Recent efforts introduced self-supervised foundation models to address these challenges, yet existing approaches do not leverage pathologist knowledge by design. In this study, we present a novel approach to designing foundation models for computational pathology, incorporating pathologist expertise, semi-automated data curation, and a diverse dataset from over 15 laboratories, including 58 tissue types, and encompassing 129 different histochemical and immunohistochemical staining modalities. We demonstrate that our model "RudolfV" surpasses existing state-of-the-art foundation models across different benchmarks focused on tumor microenvironment profiling, biomarker evaluation, and reference case search while exhibiting favorable robustness properties.

Standard transfer learning using pre-trained weights as the initialization transfers limited information and commits us to often massive pre-trained architectures. This procedure also precludes combining multiple pre-trained models that learn complementary information. To address these shortcomings, we introduce Adaptive Feature Transfer (AFT). Instead of transferring weights, AFT operates purely on features, thereby decoupling the choice of the pre-trained model from the smaller downstream model. Rather than indiscriminately compressing all pre-trained features, AFT adaptively transfers pre-trained features that are most useful for performing the downstream task, using a simple regularization that adds minimal overhead. Across multiple vision, language, and multi-modal datasets, AFT achieves significantly better downstream performance compared to alternatives with a similar computational cost. Furthermore, AFT reliably translates improvement in pre-trained models into improvement in downstream performance, even if the downstream model is over $50\times$ smaller, and can effectively transfer complementary information learned by multiple pre-trained models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2024.

A Case Study on Curb Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07202v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curbs serve as vital borders that delineate safe pedestrian zones from potential vehicular traffic hazards. Curbs also represent a primary spatial hazard during dynamic navigation with significant stumbling potential. Such vulnerabilities are particularly exacerbated for persons with blindness and low vision (PBLV). Accurate visual-based discrimination of curbs is paramount for assistive technologies that aid PBLV with safe navigation in urban environments. Herein, we investigate the efficacy of curb segmentation for foundation models. We introduce the largest curb segmentation dataset to-date to benchmark leading foundation models. Our results show that state-of-the-art foundation models face significant challenges in curb segmentation. This is due to their high false-positive rates (up to 95%) with poor performance distinguishing curbs from curb-like objects or non-curb areas, such as sidewalks. In addition, the best-performing model averaged a 3.70-second inference time, underscoring problems in providing real-time assistance. In response, we propose solutions including filtered bounding box selections to achieve more accurate curb segmentation. Overall, despite the immediate flexibility of foundation models, their application for practical assistive technology applications still requires refinement. This research highlights the critical need for specialized datasets and tailored model training to address navigation challenges for PBLV and underscores implicit weaknesses in foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, submitted to Assistive Technology</p></details> |

However, their capabilities are restricted to performing online inference solely based on their own observations and models, thus lacking a comprehensive understanding of large-scale remote sensing scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a Remote Sensing Distributed Foundation Model (RS-DFM) based on generalized information mapping and interaction. This model can realize online collaborative perception across multiple platforms and various downstream tasks by mapping observations into a unified space and implementing a task-agnostic information interaction strategy. Specifically, we leverage the ground-based geometric prior of remote sensing oblique observations to transform the feature mapping from absolute depth estimation to relative depth estimation, thereby enhancing the model's ability to extract generalized features across diverse heights and perspectives. Additionally, we present a dual-branch information compression module to decouple high-frequency and low-frequency feature information, achieving feature-level compression while preserving essential task-agnostic details. In support of our research, we create a multi-task simulation dataset named AirCo-MultiTasks for multi-UAV collaborative observation. We also conduct extensive experiments, including 3D object detection, instance segmentation, and trajectory prediction. The numerous results demonstrate that our RS-DFM achieves state-of-the-art performance across various downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite generating high-quality images, existing methods are limited in relying mainly on text control conditions and thus don't always generate images accurately and stablely. In this paper, we propose CRS-Diff, a new RS generative foundation framework specifically tailored for RS image generation, leveraging the inherent advantages of diffusion models while integrating more advanced control mechanisms. Specifically, CRS-Diff can simultaneously support text-condition, metadata-condition, and image-condition control inputs, thus enabling more precise control to refine the generation process. To effectively integrate multiple condition control information, we introduce a new conditional control mechanism to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, thus enhancing the guiding effect of control conditions. To our knowledge, CRS-Diff is the first multiple-condition controllable generative RS foundation model. Experimental results in single-condition and multiple-condition cases have demonstrated the superior ability of our CRS-Diff to generate RS images both quantitatively and qualitatively compared with previous methods.

Of particular interest is the 2B parameter Gemma model, which provides opportunities to construct capable small-scale MMFMs. In line with findings from other papers in this space, we test the effect of ablating three design features: pretraining the connector, utilizing a more powerful image backbone, and increasing the size of the language backbone. The resulting models, which we call LLaVA-Gemma, exhibit moderate performance on an array of evaluations, but fail to improve past the current comparably sized SOTA models. Closer analysis of performance shows mixed effects; skipping pretraining tends to reduce performance, larger vision models sometimes improve performance, and increasing language model size has inconsistent effects. We publicly release training recipes, code and weights for our models for the LLaVA-Gemma models.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024, MMFM workshop.

| **[SeeFar: Satellite Agnostic Multi-Resolution Dataset for Geospatial Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06776v1)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>SeeFar is an evolving collection of multi-resolution satellite images from public and commercial satellites. We specifically curated this dataset for training geospatial foundation models, unconstrained by satellite type. In recent years, advances in technology have made satellite imagery more accessible than ever. More earth-observing satellites have been launched in the last five years than in the previous fifty. Modern commercial satellites now offer up to 100 times the spatial resolution of public access satellites. However, the high cost and limited historical availability of commercial satellite imagery is a barrier to the training of foundational models, impacting what images can be used during inference. The SeeFar dataset represents a step towards training models that are satellite-agnostic by combining multi-resolution commercial and public access pre-processed images. This will enable users to utilize historical data alongside higher-resolution, more expensive satellite imagery, offering greater flexibility during inference. To achieve this, we describe a process for standardizing data from diverse satellite sources, normalizing different data formats, and aligning spectral bands to enhance interoperability. The SeeFar dataset includes images at a resolution of 384x384 pixels, spanning four spectral bands (Blue, Green, Red, and Near-Infrared) and expanding spatial resolutions (starting with 30, 10, 1.5, and 1.0 meters), all in cloud-optimized GeoTIFF format. It also provides consistent and comprehensive metadata to enhance data transparency and reliability. By aggregating data from multiple sources, SeeFar makes processed and consistent satellite data accessible to a wider range of users - from researchers to policymakers - fostering competition and innovation in satellite imagery analysis.

| **[SAM-CLIP: Merging Vision Foundation Models towards Semantic and Spatial Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15308v4)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The landscape of publicly available vision foundation models (VFMs), such as CLIP and Segment Anything Model (SAM), is expanding rapidly. VFMs are endowed with distinct capabilities stemming from their pre-training objectives. For instance, CLIP excels in semantic understanding, while SAM specializes in spatial understanding for segmentation. In this work, we introduce a simple recipe to efficiently merge VFMs into a unified model that absorbs their expertise. Our method integrates techniques of multi-task learning, continual learning, and distillation. Further, it demands significantly less computational cost compared to traditional multi-task training from scratch, and it only needs a small fraction of the pre-training datasets that were initially used to train individual models. By applying our method to SAM and CLIP, we obtain SAM-CLIP: a unified model that combines the capabilities of SAM and CLIP into a single vision transformer. Compared with deploying SAM and CLIP independently, our merged model, SAM-CLIP, reduces storage and compute costs for inference, making it well-suited for edge device applications. We show that SAM-CLIP not only retains the foundational strengths of SAM and CLIP, but also introduces synergistic functionalities, notably in zero-shot semantic segmentation, where SAM-CLIP establishes new state-of-the-art results on 5 benchmarks. It outperforms previous models that are specifically designed for this task by a large margin, including +6.8% and +5.9% mean IoU improvement on Pascal-VOC and COCO-Stuff datasets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Benchmark Vision Foundation Models for Semantic Segmentation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12172v2)** | 2024-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent vision foundation models (VFMs) have demonstrated proficiency in various tasks but require supervised fine-tuning to perform the task of semantic segmentation effectively. Benchmarking their performance is essential for selecting current models and guiding future model developments for this task. The lack of a standardized benchmark complicates comparisons. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to study how VFMs should be benchmarked for semantic segmentation. To do so, various VFMs are fine-tuned under various settings, and the impact of individual settings on the performance ranking and training time is assessed. Based on the results, the recommendation is to fine-tune the ViT-B variants of VFMs with a 16x16 patch size and a linear decoder, as these settings are representative of using a larger model, more advanced decoder and smaller patch size, while reducing training time by more than 13 times. Using multiple datasets for training and evaluation is also recommended, as the performance ranking across datasets and domain shifts varies. Linear probing, a common practice for some VFMs, is not recommended, as it is not representative of end-to-end fine-tuning. The benchmarking setup recommended in this paper enables a performance analysis of VFMs for semantic segmentation. The findings of such an analysis reveal that pretraining with promptable segmentation is not beneficial, whereas masked image modeling (MIM) with abstract representations is crucial, even more important than the type of supervision used. The code for efficiently fine-tuning VFMs for semantic segmentation can be accessed through the project page at: https://tue-mps.github.io/benchmark-vfm-ss/.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024 Workshop Proceedings for the Second Workshop on Foundation Models. v2 updates image normalization preprocessing for linear probing with EVA-02, EVA-02-CLIP, SigLIP, DFN (the impact on end-to-end fine-tuning is negligible; no changes made)</p></details> |
| **[Hibou: A Family of Foundational Vision Transformers for Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05074v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pathology, the microscopic examination of diseased tissue, is critical for diagnosing various medical conditions, particularly cancers. Traditional methods are labor-intensive and prone to human error. Digital pathology, which converts glass slides into high-resolution digital images for analysis by computer algorithms, revolutionizes the field by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, consistency, and efficiency through automated image analysis and large-scale data processing. Foundational transformer pretraining is crucial for developing robust, generalizable models as it enables learning from vast amounts of unannotated data. This paper introduces the Hibou family of foundational vision transformers for pathology, leveraging the DINOv2 framework to pretrain two model variants, Hibou-B and Hibou-L, on a proprietary dataset of over 1 million whole slide images (WSIs) representing diverse tissue types and staining techniques. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance on both patch-level and slide-level benchmarks, surpassing existing state-of-the-art methods. Notably, Hibou-L achieves the highest average accuracy across multiple benchmark datasets. To support further research and application in the field, we have open-sourced the Hibou-B model, which can be accessed at https://github.com/HistAI/hibou</p></details> |  |
| **[CoViS-Net: A Cooperative Visual Spatial Foundation Model for Multi-Robot Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01107v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous robot operation in unstructured environments is often underpinned by spatial understanding through vision. Systems composed of multiple concurrently operating robots additionally require access to frequent, accurate and reliable pose estimates. Classical vision-based methods to regress relative pose are commonly computationally expensive (precluding real-time applications), and often lack data-derived priors for resolving ambiguities. In this work, we propose CoViS-Net, a cooperative, multi-robot visual spatial foundation model that learns spatial priors from data, enabling pose estimation as well as general spatial comprehension. Our model is fully decentralized, platform-agnostic, executable in real-time using onboard compute, and does not require existing networking infrastructure. CoViS-Net provides relative pose estimates and a local bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation, even without camera overlap between robots, and can predict BEV representations of unseen regions. We demonstrate its use in a multi-robot formation control task across various real-world settings. We provide supplementary material online and will open source our trained model in due course. https://sites.google.com/view/covis-net</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Plasticity-Inspired Multimodal Foundation Model for Earth Observation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15356v2)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of foundation models has revolutionized our ability to interpret the Earth's surface using satellite observational data. Traditional models have been siloed, tailored to specific sensors or data types like optical, radar, and hyperspectral, each with its own unique characteristics. This specialization hinders the potential for a holistic analysis that could benefit from the combined strengths of these diverse data sources. Our novel approach introduces the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, leveraging the concept of neural plasticity in brain science to integrate various data modalities into a single framework adaptively. This dynamic hypernetwork, adjusting to different wavelengths, enables a single versatile Transformer jointly trained on data from five sensors to excel across 12 distinct Earth observation tasks, including sensors never seen during pretraining. DOFA's innovative design offers a promising leap towards more accurate, efficient, and unified Earth observation analysis, showcasing remarkable adaptability and performance in harnessing the potential of multimodal Earth observation data.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |
| **[CTSyn: A Foundational Model for Cross Tabular Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04619v1)** | 2024-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative Foundation Models (GFMs) have produced synthetic data with remarkable quality in modalities such as images and text. However, applying GFMs to tabular data poses significant challenges due to the inherent heterogeneity of table features. Existing cross-table learning frameworks are hindered by the absence of both a generative model backbone and a decoding mechanism for heterogeneous feature values. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Cross-Table Synthesizer (CTSyn), a diffusion-based foundational model tailored for tabular data generation. CTSyn introduces three major components: an aggregator that consolidates heterogeneous tables into a unified latent space; a conditional latent diffusion model for sampling from this space; and type-specific decoders that reconstruct values of varied data types from sampled latent vectors. Extensive testing on real-world datasets reveals that CTSyn not only significantly outperforms existing table synthesizers in utility and diversity, but also uniquely enhances performances of downstream machine learning beyond what is achievable with real data, thus establishing a new paradigm for synthetic data generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenBench: A Benchmarking Suite for Systematic Evaluation of Genomic Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01627v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Genomic Foundation Model (GFM) paradigm is expected to facilitate the extraction of generalizable representations from massive genomic data, thereby enabling their application across a spectrum of downstream applications. Despite advancements, a lack of evaluation framework makes it difficult to ensure equitable assessment due to experimental settings, model intricacy, benchmark datasets, and reproducibility challenges. In the absence of standardization, comparative analyses risk becoming biased and unreliable. To surmount this impasse, we introduce GenBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite specifically tailored for evaluating the efficacy of Genomic Foundation Models. GenBench offers a modular and expandable framework that encapsulates a variety of state-of-the-art methodologies. Through systematic evaluations of datasets spanning diverse biological domains with a particular emphasis on both short-range and long-range genomic tasks, firstly including the three most important DNA tasks covering Coding Region, Non-Coding Region, Genome Structure, etc. Moreover, We provide a nuanced analysis of the interplay between model architecture and dataset characteristics on task-specific performance. Our findings reveal an interesting observation: independent of the number of parameters, the discernible difference in preference between the attention-based and convolution-based models on short- and long-range tasks may provide insights into the future design of GFM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rewards-in-Context: Multi-objective Alignment of Foundation Models with Dynamic Preference Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10207v5)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of multi-objective alignment of foundation models with human preferences, which is a critical step towards helpful and harmless AI systems. However, it is generally costly and unstable to fine-tune large foundation models using reinforcement learning (RL), and the multi-dimensionality, heterogeneity, and conflicting nature of human preferences further complicate the alignment process. In this paper, we introduce Rewards-in-Context (RiC), which conditions the response of a foundation model on multiple rewards in its prompt context and applies supervised fine-tuning for alignment. The salient features of RiC are simplicity and adaptivity, as it only requires supervised fine-tuning of a single foundation model and supports dynamic adjustment for user preferences during inference time. Inspired by the analytical solution of an abstracted convex optimization problem, our dynamic inference-time adjustment method approaches the Pareto-optimal solution for multiple objectives. Empirical evidence demonstrates the efficacy of our method in aligning both Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion models to accommodate diverse rewards with only around 10% GPU hours compared with multi-objective RL baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Towards More General Video-based Deepfake Detection through Facial Feature Guided Adaptation for Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05583v2)** | 2024-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of deep learning, generative models have enabled the creation of highly realistic synthetic images, presenting challenges due to their potential misuse. While research in Deepfake detection has grown rapidly in response, many detection methods struggle with unseen Deepfakes generated by new synthesis techniques. To address this generalisation challenge, we propose a novel Deepfake detection approach by adapting the Foundation Models with rich information encoded inside, specifically using the image encoder from CLIP which has demonstrated strong zero-shot capability for downstream tasks. Inspired by the recent advances of parameter efficient fine-tuning, we propose a novel side-network-based decoder to extract spatial and temporal cues from the given video clip, with the promotion of the Facial Component Guidance (FCG) to encourage the spatial feature to include features of key facial parts for more robust and general Deepfake detection. Through extensive cross-dataset evaluations, our approach exhibits superior effectiveness in identifying unseen Deepfake samples, achieving notable performance improvement even with limited training samples and manipulation types. Our model secures an average performance enhancement of 0.9\% AUROC in cross-dataset assessments comparing with state-of-the-art methods, especially a significant lead of achieving 4.4\% improvement on the challenging DFDC dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[BiomedParse: a biomedical foundation model for image parsing of everything everywhere all at once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12971v3)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical image analysis is fundamental for biomedical discovery in cell biology, pathology, radiology, and many other biomedical domains. Holistic image analysis comprises interdependent subtasks such as segmentation, detection, and recognition of relevant objects. Here, we propose BiomedParse, a biomedical foundation model for imaging parsing that can jointly conduct segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9 imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary, BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://aka.ms/biomedparse-project</p></details> |
| **[Active Label Correction for Semantic Segmentation with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10820v2)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training and validating models for semantic segmentation require datasets with pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously labor-intensive. Although useful priors such as foundation models or crowdsourced datasets are available, they are error-prone. We hence propose an effective framework of active label correction (ALC) based on a design of correction query to rectify pseudo labels of pixels, which in turn is more annotator-friendly than the standard one inquiring to classify a pixel directly according to our theoretical analysis and user study. Specifically, leveraging foundation models providing useful zero-shot predictions on pseudo labels and superpixels, our method comprises two key techniques: (i) an annotator-friendly design of correction query with the pseudo labels, and (ii) an acquisition function looking ahead label expansions based on the superpixels. Experimental results on PASCAL, Cityscapes, and Kvasir-SEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our ALC framework, outperforming prior methods for active semantic segmentation and label correction. Notably, utilizing our method, we obtained a revised dataset of PASCAL by rectifying errors in 2.6 million pixels in PASCAL dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations of logic programming in hybrid-dynamic quantum logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02085v1)** | 2024-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The main contribution of the present paper is the introduction of a simple yet expressive hybrid-dynamic logic for describing quantum programs. This version of quantum logic can express quantum measurements and unitary evolutions of states in a natural way based on concepts advanced in (hybrid and dynamic) modal logics. We then study Horn clauses in the hybrid-dynamic quantum logic proposed, and develop a series of results that lead to an initial semantics theorem for sets of clauses that are satisfiable. This shows that a significant fragment of hybrid-dynamic quantum logic has good computational properties, and can serve as a basis for defining executable languages for specifying quantum programs. We set the foundations of logic programming in this fragment by proving a variant of Herbrand's theorem, which reduces the semantic entailment of a logic-programming query by a program to the search of a suitable substitution.</p></details> |  |

However, FRS faces inherent limitations such as data heterogeneity and scarcity, due to the privacy requirements of FL and the typical data sparsity issues of RSs. Models like ChatGPT are empowered by the concept of transfer learning and self-supervised learning, so they can be easily applied to the downstream tasks after fine-tuning or prompting. These models, so-called Foundation Models (FM), fouce on understanding the human's intent and perform following their designed roles in the specific tasks, which are widely recognized for producing high-quality content in the image and language domains. Thus, the achievements of FMs inspire the design of FRS and suggest a promising research direction: integrating foundation models to address the above limitations. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive review of FRSs with FMs. Specifically, we: 1) summarise the common approaches of current FRSs and FMs; 2) review the challenges posed by FRSs and FMs; 3) discuss potential future research directions; and 4) introduce some common benchmarks and evaluation metrics in the FRS field. We hope that this position paper provides the necessary background and guidance to explore this interesting and emerging topic.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, position paper</p></details> |
| **[Towards Causal Foundation Model: on Duality between Causal Inference and Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00809v3)** | 2024-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have brought changes to the landscape of machine learning, demonstrating sparks of human-level intelligence across a diverse array of tasks. However, a gap persists in complex tasks such as causal inference, primarily due to challenges associated with intricate reasoning steps and high numerical precision requirements. In this work, we take a first step towards building causally-aware foundation models for treatment effect estimations. We propose a novel, theoretically justified method called Causal Inference with Attention (CInA), which utilizes multiple unlabeled datasets to perform self-supervised causal learning, and subsequently enables zero-shot causal inference on unseen tasks with new data. This is based on our theoretical results that demonstrate the primal-dual connection between optimal covariate balancing and self-attention, facilitating zero-shot causal inference through the final layer of a trained transformer-type architecture. We demonstrate empirically that CInA effectively generalizes to out-of-distribution datasets and various real-world datasets, matching or even surpassing traditional per-dataset methodologies. These results provide compelling evidence that our method has the potential to serve as a stepping stone for the development of causal foundation models.</p></details> |  |
