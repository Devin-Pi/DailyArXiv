| **[GIS Copilot: Towards an Autonomous GIS Agent for Spatial Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03205v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Generative AI offer promising capabilities for spatial analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of generative AI with established GIS platforms remains underexplored. In this study, we propose a framework for integrating LLMs directly into existing GIS platforms, using QGIS as an example. Our approach leverages the reasoning and programming capabilities of LLMs to autonomously generate spatial analysis workflows and code through an informed agent that has comprehensive documentation of key GIS tools and parameters. The implementation of this framework resulted in the development of a "GIS Copilot" that allows GIS users to interact with QGIS using natural language commands for spatial analysis. The GIS Copilot was evaluated based on three complexity levels: basic tasks that require one GIS tool and typically involve one data layer to perform simple operations; intermediate tasks involving multi-step processes with multiple tools, guided by user instructions; and advanced tasks which involve multi-step processes that require multiple tools but not guided by user instructions, necessitating the agent to independently decide on and executes the necessary steps. The evaluation reveals that the GIS Copilot demonstrates strong potential in automating foundational GIS operations, with a high success rate in tool selection and code generation for basic and intermediate tasks, while challenges remain in achieving full autonomy for more complex tasks. This study contributes to the emerging vision of Autonomous GIS, providing a pathway for non-experts to engage with geospatial analysis with minimal prior expertise. While full autonomy is yet to be achieved, the GIS Copilot demonstrates significant potential for simplifying GIS workflows and enhancing decision-making processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blind Estimation of Sub-band Acoustic Parameters from Ambisonics Recordings using Spectro-Spatial Covariance Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03172v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating frequency-varying acoustic parameters is essential for enhancing immersive perception in realistic spatial audio creation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that blindly estimates reverberation time (T60), direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity (C50) across 10 frequency bands using first-order Ambisonics (FOA) speech recordings as inputs. The proposed framework utilizes a novel feature named Spectro-Spatial Covariance Vector (SSCV), efficiently representing temporal, spectral as well as spatial information of the FOA signal. Our models significantly outperform existing single-channel methods with only spectral information, reducing estimation errors by more than half for all three acoustic parameters. Additionally, we introduce FOA-Conv3D, a novel back-end network for effectively utilising the SSCV feature with a 3D convolutional encoder. FOA-Conv3D outperforms the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent convolutional neural network (CRNN) backends, achieving lower estimation errors and accounting for a higher proportion of variance (PoV) for all 3 acoustic parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP2025</p></details> |
| **[What Roles can Spatial Modulation and Space Shift Keying Play in LEO Satellite-Assisted Communication?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17553v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rapid evolution of satellite communications play a pivotal role in addressing the ever-increasing demand for global connectivity, among which the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites attract a great amount of attention due to their low latency and high data throughput capabilities. Based on this, we explore spatial modulation (SM) and space shift keying (SSK) designs as pivotal techniques to enhance spectral efficiency (SE) and bit-error rate (BER) performance in the LEO satellite-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The various performance analysis of these designs are presented in this paper, revealing insightful findings and conclusions through analytical methods and Monte Carlo simulations with perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) estimation. The results provide a comprehensive analysis of the merits and trade-offs associated with the investigated schemes, particularly in terms of BER, computational complexity, and SE. This analysis underscores the potential of both schemes as viable candidates for future 6G LEO satellite-assisted wireless communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRANSPOSE: Transitional Approaches for Spatially-Aware LFI Resilient FSM Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02798v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finite state machines (FSMs) regulate sequential circuits, including access to sensitive information and privileged CPU states. Courtesy of contemporary research on laser attacks, laser-based fault injection (LFI) is becoming even more precise where an adversary can thwart chip security by altering individual flip-flop (FF) values. Different laser models, e.g., bit flip, bit set, and bit reset, have been developed to appreciate LFI on practical targets. As traditional approaches may incorporate substantial overhead, state-based SPARSE and transition-based TAMED countermeasures were proposed in our prior work to improve FSM resiliency efficiently. TAMED overcame SPARSE's limitation of being too conservative, and generating multiple LFI resilient encodings for contemporary LFI models on demand. SPARSE, however, incorporated design layout information into its vulnerability estimation which makes its vulnerability estimation metric more accurate. In this paper, we extend TAMED by proposing a transition-based encoding CAD framework (TRANSPOSE), that incorporates spatial transitional vulnerability metrics to quantify design susceptibility of FSMs based on both the bit flip model and the set-reset models. TRANSPOSE also incorporates floorplan optimization into its framework to accommodate secure spatial inter-distance of FF-sensitive regions. All TRANSPOSE approaches are demonstrated on 5 multifarious benchmarks and outperform existing FSM encoding schemes/frameworks in terms of security and overhead.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Spatially Non-Stationary XL-MIMO Channel Estimation: A Three-Layer Generalized Approximate Message Passing Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02633v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multi-input multi-output (XL-MIMO) systems is investigated with the considerations of the spherical wavefront effect and the spatially non-stationary (SnS) property. Due to the diversities of SnS characteristics among different propagation paths, the concurrent channel estimation of multiple paths becomes intractable. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase channel estimation scheme. In the first phase, the angles of departure (AoDs) on the user side are estimated, and a carefully designed pilot transmission scheme enables the decomposition of the received signal from different paths. In the second phase, the subchannel estimation corresponding to different paths is formulated as a three-layer Bayesian inference problem. Specifically, the first layer captures block sparsity in the angular domain, the second layer promotes SnS property in the antenna domain, and the third layer decouples the subchannels from the observed signals. To efficiently facilitate Bayesian inference, we propose a novel three-layer generalized approximate message passing (TL-GAMP) algorithm based on structured variational massage passing and belief propagation rules. Simulation results validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its robustness to different channel scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>A rev...</summary><p>A revised manuscript has been submitted to the IEEE journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[CollaMamba: Efficient Collaborative Perception with Cross-Agent Spatial-Temporal State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07714v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By sharing complementary perceptual information, multi-agent collaborative perception fosters a deeper understanding of the environment. Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is A Picture Worth A Thousand Words? Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14852v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning -- a fundamental component of human cognition -- remains under-explored. We propose SpatialEval, a novel benchmark that covers diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[SPACE: 3D Spatial Co-operation and Exploration Framework for Robust Mapping and Coverage with Multi-Robot Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02524v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In indoor environments, multi-robot visual (RGB-D) mapping and exploration hold immense potential for application in domains such as domestic service and logistics, where deploying multiple robots in the same environment can significantly enhance efficiency. However, there are two primary challenges: (1) the "ghosting trail" effect, which occurs due to overlapping views of robots impacting the accuracy and quality of point cloud reconstruction, and (2) the oversight of visual reconstructions in selecting the most effective frontiers for exploration. Given these challenges are interrelated, we address them together by proposing a new semi-distributed framework (SPACE) for spatial cooperation in indoor environments that enables enhanced coverage and 3D mapping. SPACE leverages geometric techniques, including "mutual awareness" and a "dynamic robot filter," to overcome spatial mapping constraints. Additionally, we introduce a novel spatial frontier detection system and map merger, integrated with an adaptive frontier assigner for optimal coverage balancing the exploration and reconstruction objectives. In extensive ROS-Gazebo simulations, SPACE demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches in both exploration and mapping metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grid-Based Projection of Spatial Data into Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02309v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Spatial Knowledge Graphs (SKG) are experiencing growing adoption as a means to model real-world entities, proving especially invaluable in domains like crisis management and urban planning. Considering that RDF specifications offer limited support for effectively managing spatial information, it's common practice to include text-based serializations of geometrical features, such as polygons and lines, as string literals in knowledge graphs. Consequently, Spatial Knowledge Graphs (SKGs) often rely on geo-enabled RDF Stores capable of parsing, interpreting, and indexing such serializations. In this paper, we leverage grid cells as the foundational element of SKGs and demonstrate how efficiently the spatial characteristics of real-world entities and their attributes can be encoded within knowledge graphs. Furthermore, we introduce a novel methodology for representing street networks in knowledge graphs, diverging from the conventional practice of individually capturing each street segment. Instead, our approach is based on tessellating the street network using grid cells and creating a simplified representation that could be utilized for various routing and navigation tasks, solely relying on RDF specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ManiBox: Enhancing Spatial Grasping Generalization via Scalable Simulation Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01850v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning a precise robotic grasping policy is crucial for embodied agents operating in complex real-world manipulation tasks. Despite significant advancements, most models still struggle with accurate spatial positioning of objects to be grasped. We first show that this spatial generalization challenge stems primarily from the extensive data requirements for adequate spatial understanding. However, collecting such data with real robots is prohibitively expensive, and relying on simulation data often leads to visual generalization gaps upon deployment. To overcome these challenges, we then focus on state-based policy generalization and present \textbf{ManiBox}, a novel bounding-box-guided manipulation method built on a simulation-based teacher-student framework. The teacher policy efficiently generates scalable simulation data using bounding boxes, which are proven to uniquely determine the objects' spatial positions. The student policy then utilizes these low-dimensional spatial states to enable zero-shot transfer to real robots. Through comprehensive evaluations in simulated and real-world environments, ManiBox demonstrates a marked improvement in spatial grasping generalization and adaptability to diverse objects and backgrounds. Further, our empirical study into scaling laws for policy performance indicates that spatial volume generalization scales positively with data volume. For a certain level of spatial volume, the success rate of grasping empirically follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics relative to data volume, showing a saturation effect as data increases. Our videos and code are available in https://thkkk.github.io/manibox.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Home Range and Intra-Specific Spatial Interaction in Wild Animal Populations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01694v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interactions among individuals from the same-species of wild animals are an important component of population dynamics. An interaction can be either static (based on overlap of space use) or dynamic (based on movement). The goal of this work is to determine the level of static interactions between individuals from the same-species of wild animals using 95\% and 50\% home ranges, as well as to model their movement interactions, which could include attraction, avoidance (or repulsion), or lack of interaction, in order to gain new insights and improve our understanding of ecological processes. Home range estimation methods (minimum convex polygon, kernel density estimator, and autocorrelated kernel density estimator), inhomogeneous multitype (or cross-type) summary statistics, and envelope testing methods (pointwise and global envelope tests) were proposed to study the nature of the same-species wild-animal spatial interactions. Using GPS collar data, we applied the methods to quantify both static and dynamic interactions between black bears in southern Alabama, USA. In general, our findings suggest that the black bears in our dataset showed no significant preference to live together or apart, i.e., there was no significant deviation from independence toward association or avoidance (i.e., segregation) between the bears.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph Fourier Neural ODEs: Bridging Spatial and Temporal Multiscales in Molecular Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01600v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics simulations are crucial for understanding complex physical, chemical, and biological processes at the atomic level. However, accurately capturing interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales remains a significant challenge. We present a novel framework that jointly models spatial and temporal multiscale interactions in molecular dynamics. Our approach leverages Graph Fourier Transforms to decompose molecular structures into different spatial scales and employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model the temporal dynamics in a curated manner influenced by the spatial modes. This unified framework links spatial structures with temporal evolution in a flexible manner, enabling more accurate and comprehensive simulations of molecular systems. We evaluate our model on the MD17 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple molecules, particularly under challenging conditions such as irregular timestep sampling and long-term prediction horizons. Ablation studies confirm the significant contributions of both spatial and temporal multiscale modeling components. Our method advances the simulation of complex molecular systems, potentially accelerating research in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.</p></details> |  |
| **[HEST-1k: A Dataset for Spatial Transcriptomics and Histology Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16192v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics enables interrogating the molecular composition of tissue with ever-increasing resolution and sensitivity. However, costs, rapidly evolving technology, and lack of standards have constrained computational methods in ST to narrow tasks and small cohorts. In addition, the underlying tissue morphology, as reflected by H&E-stained whole slide images (WSIs), encodes rich information often overlooked in ST studies. Here, we introduce HEST-1k, a collection of 1,229 spatial transcriptomic profiles, each linked to a WSI and extensive metadata. HEST-1k was assembled from 153 public and internal cohorts encompassing 26 organs, two species (Homo Sapiens and Mus Musculus), and 367 cancer samples from 25 cancer types. HEST-1k processing enabled the identification of 2.1 million expression--morphology pairs and over 76 million nuclei. To support its development, we additionally introduce the HEST-Library, a Python package designed to perform a range of actions with HEST samples. We test HEST-1k and Library on three use cases: (1) benchmarking foundation models for pathology (HEST-Benchmark), (2) biomarker exploration, and (3) multimodal representation learning. HEST-1k, HEST-Library, and HEST-Benchmark can be freely accessed at https://github.com/mahmoodlab/hest.</p></details> | NeurIPS'24 Spotlight |
| **[ProGen: Revisiting Probabilistic Spatial-Temporal Time Series Forecasting from a Continuous Generative Perspective Using Stochastic Differential Equations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01267v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate forecasting of spatiotemporal data remains challenging due to complex spatial dependencies and temporal dynamics. The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Transformers for Radio Map Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01211v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radio map estimation (RME) involves spatial interpolation of radio measurements to predict metrics such as the received signal strength at locations where no measurements were collected. The most popular estimators nowadays project the measurement locations to a regular grid and complete the resulting measurement tensor with a convolutional deep neural network. Unfortunately, these approaches suffer from poor spatial resolution and require a great number of parameters. The first contribution of this paper addresses these limitations by means of an attention-based estimator named Spatial TransfOrmer for Radio Map estimation (STORM). This scheme not only outperforms the existing estimators, but also exhibits lower computational complexity, translation equivariance, rotation equivariance, and full spatial resolution. The second contribution is an extended transformer architecture that allows STORM to perform active sensing, where the next measurement location is selected based on the previous measurements. This is particularly useful for minimization of drive tests (MDT) in cellular networks, where operators request user equipment to collect measurements. Finally, STORM is extensively validated by experiments with one ray-tracing and two real datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal estimation in spatially distributed systems: how far to share measurements from?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14781v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the centralized optimal estimation problem in spatially distributed systems. We use the setting of spatially invariant systems as an idealization for which concrete and detailed results are given. Such estimators are known to have a degree of spatial localization in the sense that the estimator gains decay in space, with the spatial decay rates serving as a proxy for how far measurements need to be shared in an optimal distributed estimator. In particular, we examine the dependence of spatial decay rates on problem specifications such as system dynamics, measurement and process noise variances, as well as their spatial autocorrelations. We propose non-dimensional parameters that characterize the decay rates as a function of problem specifications. In particular, we find an interesting matching condition between the characteristic lengthscale of the dynamics and the measurement noise correlation lengthscale for which the optimal centralized estimator is completely decentralized. A new technique - termed the Branch Point Locus - is introduced to quantify spatial decay rates in terms of analyticity regions in the complex spatial frequency plane. Our results are illustrated through two case studies of systems with dynamics modeled by diffusion and the Swift-Hohenberg equation, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Indicators of Mark Association for Spatial Marked Point Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01065v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of distinct local mark behaviours is becoming increasingly common in the applications of spatial marked point processes. This dynamic highlights the limitations of existing global mark correlation functions in accurately identifying the true patterns of mark associations/variations among points as distinct mark behaviours might dominate one another, giving rise to an incomplete understanding of mark associations. In this paper, we introduce a family of local indicators of mark association (LIMA) functions for spatial marked point processes. These functions are defined on general state spaces and can include marks that are either real-valued or function-valued. Unlike global mark correlation functions, which are often distorted by the existence of distinct mark behaviours, LIMA functions reliably identify all types of mark associations and variations among points. Additionally, they accurately determine the interpoint distances where individual points show significant mark associations. Through simulation studies, featuring various scenarios, and four real applications in forestry, criminology, and urban mobility, we study spatial marked point processes in $\R^2$ and on linear networks with either real-valued or function-valued marks, demonstrating that LIMA functions significantly outperform the existing global mark correlation functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Spatially-Aware Diffusion Models with Cross-Attention for Global Field Reconstruction with Sparse Observations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00230v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have gained attention for their ability to represent complex distributions and incorporate uncertainty, making them ideal for robust predictions in the presence of noisy or incomplete data. In this study, we develop and enhance score-based diffusion models in field reconstruction tasks, where the goal is to estimate complete spatial fields from partial observations. We introduce a condition encoding approach to construct a tractable mapping mapping between observed and unobserved regions using a learnable integration of sparse observations and interpolated fields as an inductive bias. With refined sensing representations and an unraveled temporal dimension, our method can handle arbitrary moving sensors and effectively reconstruct fields. Furthermore, we conduct a comprehensive benchmark of our approach against a deterministic interpolation-based method across various static and time-dependent PDEs. Our study attempts to addresses the gap in strong baselines for evaluating performance across varying sampling hyperparameters, noise levels, and conditioning methods. Our results show that diffusion models with cross-attention and the proposed conditional encoding generally outperform other methods under noisy conditions, although the deterministic method excels with noiseless data. Additionally, both the diffusion models and the deterministic method surpass the numerical approach in accuracy and computational cost for the steady problem. We also demonstrate the ability of the model to capture possible reconstructions and improve the accuracy of fused results in covariance-based correction tasks using ensemble sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Bridge Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity in Link Prediction? A Contrastive Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial public goods games on any population structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00398v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the emergence of cooperation in spatially structured populations has advanced significantly in the context of pairwise games, but the fundamental theory of group-based public goods games (PGGs) remains less explored. Here, we provide theoretical conditions under which cooperation thrive in spatial PGGs on any population structure, which are accurate under weak selection. We find that PGGs can support cooperation across all kinds of model details and on almost all network structures in contrast to pairwise games. For example, a class of networks that would otherwise fail to produce cooperation, such as star graphs, are particularly conducive to cooperation in spatial PGGs. This fundamental advantage of spatial PGGs derives from reciprocity through second-order interactions, allowing local structures such as the clustering coefficient to play positive roles. We also verify the robustness of spatial PGGs on empirical networks where pairwise games cannot support cooperation, which implies that PGGs could be a universal interaction mode in real-world systems.</p></details> | 56 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Improving Traffic Flow Predictions with SGCN-LSTM: A Hybrid Model for Spatial and Temporal Dependencies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00282v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large amounts of traffic can lead to negative effects such as increased car accidents, air pollution, and significant time wasted. Understanding traffic speeds on any given road segment can be highly beneficial for traffic management strategists seeking to reduce congestion. While recent studies have primarily focused on modeling spatial dependencies by using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) over fixed weighted graphs, the relationships between nodes are often more complex, with edges that interact dynamically. This paper addresses both the temporal patterns in traffic data and the intricate spatial dependencies by introducing the Signal-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network Long Short Term Memory (SGCN-LSTM) model for predicting traffic speeds across road networks. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY road network traffic dataset demonstrate the SGCN-LSTM model's effectiveness, yielding significant improvements in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to benchmark models on the same dataset.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Multi-modal Spatial Clustering for Spatial Transcriptomics Utilizing High-resolution Histology Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02534v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the intricate cellular environment within biological tissues is crucial for uncovering insights into complex biological functions. While single-cell RNA sequencing has significantly enhanced our understanding of cellular states, it lacks the spatial context necessary to fully comprehend the cellular environment. Spatial transcriptomics (ST) addresses this limitation by enabling transcriptome-wide gene expression profiling while preserving spatial context. One of the principal challenges in ST data analysis is spatial clustering, which reveals spatial domains based on the spots within a tissue. Modern ST sequencing procedures typically include a high-resolution histology image, which has been shown in previous studies to be closely connected to gene expression profiles. However, current spatial clustering methods often fail to fully integrate high-resolution histology image features with gene expression data, limiting their ability to capture critical spatial and cellular interactions. In this study, we propose the spatial transcriptomics multi-modal clustering (stMMC) model, a novel contrastive learning-based deep learning approach that integrates gene expression data with histology image features through a multi-modal parallel graph autoencoder. We tested stMMC against four state-of-the-art baseline models: Leiden, GraphST, SpaGCN, and stLearn on two public ST datasets with 13 sample slices in total. The experiments demonstrated that stMMC outperforms all the baseline models in terms of ARI and NMI. An ablation study further validated the contributions of contrastive learning and the incorporation of histology image features.</p></details> | 9 pages |

Traditional methods usually break this task into multiple subtasks, each requiring complex transformations between different data representations. For instance, dense reconstruction through Structure-from-Motion (SfM) involves converting images into key points, optimizing camera parameters, and estimating structures. Afterward, accurate sparse reconstructions are required for further dense modeling, which is subsequently fed into task-specific neural networks. This multi-step process results in considerable processing time and increased engineering complexity. In this work, we present the Large Spatial Model (LSM), which processes unposed RGB images directly into semantic radiance fields. LSM simultaneously estimates geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward operation, and it can generate versatile label maps by interacting with language at novel viewpoints. Leveraging a Transformer-based architecture, LSM integrates global geometry through pixel-aligned point maps. To enhance spatial attribute regression, we incorporate local context aggregation with multi-scale fusion, improving the accuracy of fine local details. To tackle the scarcity of labeled 3D semantic data and enable natural language-driven scene manipulation, we incorporate a pre-trained 2D language-based segmentation model into a 3D-consistent semantic feature field. An efficient decoder then parameterizes a set of semantic anisotropic Gaussians, facilitating supervised end-to-end learning. Extensive experiments across various tasks show that LSM unifies multiple 3D vision tasks directly from unposed images, achieving real-time semantic 3D reconstruction for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Website: https://largespatialmodel.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Decoupling Semantic Similarity from Spatial Alignment for Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23107v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>What representation do deep neural networks learn? How similar are images to each other for neural networks? Despite the overwhelming success of deep learning methods key questions about their internal workings still remain largely unanswered, due to their internal high dimensionality and complexity. To address this, one approach is to measure the similarity of activation responses to various inputs. Representational Similarity Matrices (RSMs) distill this similarity into scalar values for each input pair. These matrices encapsulate the entire similarity structure of a system, indicating which input leads to similar responses. While the similarity between images is ambiguous, we argue that the spatial location of semantic objects does neither influence human perception nor deep learning classifiers. Thus this should be reflected in the definition of similarity between image responses for computer vision systems. Revisiting the established similarity calculations for RSMs we expose their sensitivity to spatial alignment. In this paper, we propose to solve this through semantic RSMs, which are invariant to spatial permutation. We measure semantic similarity between input responses by formulating it as a set-matching problem. Further, we quantify the superiority of semantic RSMs over spatio-semantic RSMs through image retrieval and by comparing the similarity between representations to the similarity between predicted class probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

This study proposes a framework for quantitative fire pattern classification to support fire investigators, aiming for consistency and accuracy. The framework integrates four components. First, it leverages human-computer interaction to extract fire patterns from surfaces, combining investigator expertise with computational analysis. Second, it employs an aspect ratio-based random forest model to classify fire pattern shapes. Third, fire scene point cloud segmentation enables precise identification of fire-affected areas and the mapping of 2D fire patterns to 3D scenes. Lastly, spatial relationships between fire patterns and indoor elements support an interpretation of the fire scene. These components provide a method for fire pattern analysis that synthesizes qualitative and quantitative data. The framework's classification results achieve 93% precision on synthetic data and 83% on real fire patterns.</p></details> |  |

| **[SFDFusion: An Efficient Spatial-Frequency Domain Fusion Network for Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22837v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion aims to utilize the complementary information from two modalities to generate fused images with prominent targets and rich texture details. Most existing algorithms only perform pixel-level or feature-level fusion from different modalities in the spatial domain. They usually overlook the information in the frequency domain, and some of them suffer from inefficiency due to excessively complex structures. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient Spatial-Frequency Domain Fusion (SFDFusion) network for infrared and visible image fusion. First, we propose a Dual-Modality Refinement Module (DMRM) to extract complementary information. This module extracts useful information from both the infrared and visible modalities in the spatial domain and enhances fine-grained spatial details. Next, to introduce frequency domain information, we construct a Frequency Domain Fusion Module (FDFM) that transforms the spatial domain to the frequency domain through Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and then integrates frequency domain information. Additionally, we design a frequency domain fusion loss to provide guidance for the fusion process. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our method produces fused images with significant advantages in various fusion metrics and visual effects. Furthermore, our method demonstrates high efficiency in image fusion and good performance on downstream detection tasks, thereby satisfying the real-time demands of advanced visual tasks.</p></details> | accept in ECAI 2024 |

However, numerous benign conditions can cause increased uptake of radiopharmaceuticals, confounding differentiation from malignant tumors. Several studies have indicated that dual-time PET imaging holds promise in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumor processes. Nevertheless, the hour-long distribution period of radiopharmaceuticals post-injection complicates the determination of optimal timing for the second scan, presenting challenges in both practical applications and research. Notably, we have identified that delay time PET imaging can be framed as an image-to-image conversion problem. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel spatial-temporal guided diffusion transformer probabilistic model (st-DTPM) to solve dual-time PET imaging prediction problem. Specifically, this architecture leverages the U-net framework that integrates patch-wise features of CNN and pixel-wise relevance of Transformer to obtain local and global information. And then employs a conditional DDPM model for image synthesis. Furthermore, on spatial condition, we concatenate early scan PET images and noisy PET images on every denoising step to guide the spatial distribution of denoising sampling. On temporal condition, we convert diffusion time steps and delay time to a universal time vector, then embed it to each layer of model architecture to further improve the accuracy of predictions. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our method over alternative approaches in preserving image quality and structural information, thereby affirming its efficacy in predictive task.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods can only predict up to four hours in the future, which doesn't quite meet real-world demands. we identify that the prediction horizon is limited to a few hours mainly due to the separation of temporal and spatial factors, which results in high complexity. Drawing inspiration from Albert Einstein's relativity theory, which suggests space and time are unified and inseparable, we introduce Extralonger, which unifies temporal and spatial factors. Extralonger notably extends the prediction horizon to a week on real-world benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency in the training time, inference time, and memory usage. It sets new standards in long-term and extra-long-term scenarios.

Traditional visual spatial relationship classification (VSRC) methods typically output the spatial relationship between two objects in an image, often neglecting world knowledge and lacking general language capabilities. In this paper, we propose a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Visual Spatial Description, named LLaVA-VSD, which is designed for the classification, description, and open-ended description of visual spatial relationships. Specifically, the model first constructs a VSD instruction-following dataset using given figure-caption pairs for the three tasks. It then employs LoRA to fine-tune a Large Language and Vision Assistant for VSD, which has 13 billion parameters and supports high-resolution images.

| **[Temporal and Spatial Super Resolution with Latent Diffusion Model in Medical MRI images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23898v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super Resolution (SR) plays a critical role in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging, where hardware and acquisition time constraints often result in low spatial and temporal resolution. While diffusion models have been applied for both spatial and temporal SR, few studies have explored their use for joint spatial and temporal SR, particularly in medical imaging. In this work, we address this gap by proposing to use a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) combined with a Vector Quantised GAN (VQGAN)-based encoder-decoder architecture for joint super resolution. We frame SR as an image denoising problem, focusing on improving both spatial and temporal resolution in medical images. Using the cardiac MRI dataset from the Data Science Bowl Cardiac Challenge, consisting of 2D cine images with a spatial resolution of 256x256 and 8-14 slices per time-step, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our LDM model achieves Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.37, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.7580, and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.2756, outperforming simple baseline method by 5% in PSNR, 6.5% in SSIM, 39% in LPIPS. Our LDM model generates images with high fidelity and perceptual quality with 15 diffusion steps. These results suggest that LDMs hold promise for advancing super resolution in medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

However, decoding intentions from MI remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of EEG signals relative to the small-sample size. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-spectral and temporal dual prototype network (SST-DPN). First, we design a lightweight attention mechanism to uniformly model the spatial-spectral relationships across multiple EEG electrodes, enabling the extraction of powerful spatial-spectral features. Then, we develop a multi-scale variance pooling module tailored for EEG signals to capture long-term temporal features. This module is parameter-free and computationally efficient, offering clear advantages over the widely used transformer models. Furthermore, we introduce dual prototype learning to optimize the feature space distribution and training process, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on small-sample MI datasets. Our experimental results show that the SST-DPN outperforms state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy (84.11% for dataset BCI4-2A, 86.65% for dataset BCI4-2B). Additionally, we use the BCI3-4A dataset with fewer training data to further validate the generalization ability of the proposed SST-DPN. We also achieve superior performance with 82.03% classification accuracy. Benefiting from the lightweight parameters and superior decoding accuracy, our SST-DPN shows great potential for practical MI-BCI applications.

| **[Spatial-Aware Conformal Prediction for Trustworthy Hyperspectral Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01236v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification involves assigning unique labels to each pixel to identify various land cover categories. While deep classifiers have achieved high predictive accuracy in this field, they lack the ability to rigorously quantify confidence in their predictions. Quantifying the certainty of model predictions is crucial for the safe usage of predictive models, and this limitation restricts their application in critical contexts where the cost of prediction errors is significant. To support the safe deployment of HSI classifiers, we first provide a theoretical proof establishing the validity of the emerging uncertainty quantification technique, conformal prediction, in the context of HSI classification. We then propose a conformal procedure that equips any trained HSI classifier with trustworthy prediction sets, ensuring that these sets include the true labels with a user-specified probability (e.g., 95\%). Building on this foundation, we introduce Spatial-Aware Conformal Prediction (\texttt{SACP}), a conformal prediction framework specifically designed for HSI data. This method integrates essential spatial information inherent in HSIs by aggregating the non-conformity scores of pixels with high spatial correlation, which effectively enhances the efficiency of prediction sets. Both theoretical and empirical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The source code is available at \url{https://github.com/J4ckLiu/SACP}.</p></details> |  |

While deep learning models can generate 3D rock microstructures that match static rock properties, they have two key limitations: they don't account for the spatial distribution of rock properties that can have an important influence on the flow and transport characteristics (such as permeability and relative permeability) of the rock and they generate structures below the representative elementary volume (REV) scale for those transport properties. Addressing these issues is crucial for building a consistent workflow between pore-scale analysis and field-scale modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage modeling framework that combines a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQVAE) and a transformer model for spatial upscaling and arbitrary-size 3D porous media reconstruction in an autoregressive manner. The VQVAE first compresses and quantizes sub-volume training images into low-dimensional tokens, while we train a transformer to spatially assemble these tokens into larger images following specific spatial order. By employing a multi-token generation strategy, our approach preserves both sub-volume integrity and spatial relationships among these sub-image patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our multi-token transformer generation approach and validate it using real data from a test well, showcasing its potential to generate models for the porous media at the well scale using only a spatial porosity model. The interpolated representative porous media that reflect field-scale geological properties accurately model transport properties, including permeability and multiphase flow relative permeability of CO2 and brine.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Although necessary to provide sustainable sources of energy and food, careful planning will be important to make informed decisions and avoid conflicts. This paper examines several techniques used for marine spatial planning, an approach for analyzing and planning the use of marine resources. Using open source software including QGIS and Python, the potential for developing wave-powered offshore aquaculture farms using the RM3 wave energy converter along the Northeast coast of the United States is assessed and several feasible sites are identified. The optimal site, located at 43.7{\deg}N, 68.9{\deg}W along the coast of Maine, has a total cost for a 5-pen farm of \$56.8M, annual fish yield of 676 tonnes, and a levelized cost of fish of \$9.23 per kilogram. Overall trends indicate that the cost greatly decreases with distance to shore due to the greater availability of wave energy and that conflicts and environmental constraints significantly limit the number of feasible sites in this region.</p></details> |  |

Given their maintenance costs and impact on commercial fishing, it is critical to evaluate their effectiveness to support future conservation. In this paper, we use data collected from the Australian coast to estimate the effect of MPAs on biodiversity. Environmental studies such as these are often observational, and processes of interest exhibit spatial dependence, which presents challenges in estimating the causal effects. Spatial data can also be subject to preferential sampling, where the sampling locations are related to the response variable, further complicating inference and prediction. To address these challenges, we propose a spatial causal inference method that simultaneously accounts for unmeasured spatial confounders in both the sampling process and the treatment allocation. We prove the identifiability of key parameters in the model and the consistency of the posterior distributions of those parameters. We show via simulation studies that the causal effect of interest can be reliably estimated under the proposed model. The proposed method is applied to assess the effect of MPAs on fish biomass. We find evidence of preferential sampling and that properly accounting for this source of bias impacts the estimate of the causal effect.</p></details> |  |

GLMs include many canonical problems in statistical estimation, such as linear regression, phase retrieval, and 1-bit compressed sensing. Recent work has precisely characterized the asymptotic minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) for GLMs with i.i.d. Gaussian sensing matrices. However, in many models there is a significant gap between the MMSE and the performance of the best known feasible estimators. In this work, we address this issue by considering GLMs defined via spatially coupled sensing matrices. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for estimation and prove that with a simple choice of spatially coupled design, the MSE of a carefully tuned AMP estimator approaches the asymptotic MMSE in the high-dimensional limit. To prove the result, we first rigorously characterize the asymptotic performance of AMP for a GLM with a generic spatially coupled design. This characterization is in terms of a deterministic recursion (`state evolution') that depends on the parameters defining the spatial coupling. Then, using a simple spatially coupled design and a judicious choice of functions for the AMP algorithm, we analyze the fixed points of the resulting state evolution and show that it achieves the asymptotic MMSE. Numerical results for phase retrieval and rectified linear regression show that spatially coupled designs can yield substantially lower MSE than i.i.d. Gaussian designs at finite dimensions when used with AMP algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 4 figures.

Regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analyses, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. In this article, we will compare these two architectural configurations with each other, to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

While emergent communication literature shows success in developing various language properties, no research has shown the emergence of such positional references. This paper demonstrates how agents can communicate about spatial relationships within their observations. The results indicate that agents can develop a language capable of expressing the relationships between parts of their observation, achieving over 90% accuracy when trained in a referential game which requires such communication. Using a collocation measure, we demonstrate how the agents create such references. This analysis suggests that agents use a mixture of non-compositional and compositional messages to convey spatial relationships. We also show that the emergent language is interpretable by humans. The translation accuracy is tested by communicating with the receiver agent, where the receiver achieves over 78% accuracy using parts of this lexicon, confirming that the interpretation of the emergent language was successful.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2024. 18 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

The approach is likelihood-based with a regularization term that addresses the roughness of the logarithm of density based on a second-order differential operator. The proposed method offers greater efficiency and flexibility in estimating density over complex domains and has been theoretically supported by establishing the asymptotic convergence rate under mild natural conditions. Through extensive simulation studies and a real-world application that analyzes motor vehicle theft data from Portland City, Oregon, we demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over existing techniques detailed in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection-Guided Deep Learning-Based Model with Spatial Regularization for Lung Nodule Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20154v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lung cancer ranks as one of the leading causes of cancer diagnosis and is the foremost cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The early detection of lung nodules plays a pivotal role in improving outcomes for patients, as it enables timely and effective treatment interventions. The segmentation of lung nodules plays a critical role in aiding physicians in distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. However, this task remains challenging due to the substantial variation in the shapes and sizes of lung nodules, and their frequent proximity to lung tissues, which complicates clear delineation. In this study, we introduce a novel model for segmenting lung nodules in computed tomography (CT) images, leveraging a deep learning framework that integrates segmentation and classification processes. This model is distinguished by its use of feature combination blocks, which facilitate the sharing of information between the segmentation and classification components. Additionally, we employ the classification outcomes as priors to refine the size estimation of the predicted nodules, integrating these with a spatial regularization technique to enhance precision. Furthermore, recognizing the challenges posed by limited training datasets, we have developed an optimal transfer learning strategy that freezes certain layers to further improve performance. The results show that our proposed model can capture the target nodules more accurately compared to other commonly used models. By applying transfer learning, the performance can be further improved, achieving a sensitivity score of 0.885 and a Dice score of 0.814.</p></details> |  |

This significantly reduces users' involvement, learning, and creative capabilities, leading to a superficial understanding of spatial design. We conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study, where Novices and AI (acted by experimenters) worked together to finish spatial design tasks using various AI models. We identified typical function and workflow patterns adopted by the participants, leading to the understanding of the opportunities and challenges in the human-AI co-creation process. Based on insights gathered from this research, we proposed some design implications of the novice-AI collaboration system that aims to democratize spatial design through a progressive, iterative co-creation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>draft...</summary><p>draft submission to CHI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Virtual Reality Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10811v3)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatial computing Virtual Reality (VR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with VR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in VR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to VR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of VR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mask-Weighted Spatial Likelihood Coding for Speaker-Independent Joint Localization and Mask Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19595v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to their robustness and flexibility, neural-driven beamformers are a popular choice for speech separation in challenging environments with a varying amount of simultaneous speakers alongside noise and reverberation. Time-frequency masks and relative directions of the speakers regarding a fixed spatial grid can be used to estimate the beamformer's parameters. To some degree, speaker-independence is achieved by ensuring a greater amount of spatial partitions than speech sources. In this work, we analyze how to encode both mask and positioning into such a grid to enable joint estimation of both quantities. We propose mask-weighted spatial likelihood coding and show that it achieves considerable performance in both tasks compared to baseline encodings optimized for either localization or mask estimation. In the same setup, we demonstrate superiority for joint estimation of both quantities. Conclusively, we propose a universal approach which can replace an upstream sound source localization system solely by adapting the training framework, making it highly relevant in performance-critical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2024 IEEE.

| **[Detection of Emerging Infectious Diseases in Lung CT based on Spatial Anomaly Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19535v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast detection of emerging diseases is important for containing their spread and treating patients effectively. Local anomalies are relevant, but often novel diseases involve familiar disease patterns in new spatial distributions. Therefore, established local anomaly detection approaches may fail to identify them as new. Here, we present a novel approach to detect the emergence of new disease phenotypes exhibiting distinct patterns of the spatial distribution of lesions. We first identify anomalies in lung CT data, and then compare their distribution in a continually acquired new patient cohorts with historic patient population observed over a long prior period. We evaluate how accumulated evidence collected in the stream of patients is able to detect the onset of an emerging disease. In a gram-matrix based representation derived from the intermediate layers of a three-dimensional convolutional neural network, newly emerging clusters indicate emerging diseases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Available Degrees of Spatial Multiplexing of a Uniform Linear Array with Multiple Polarizations: a Holographic Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19497v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The capabilities of multi-antenna technology have recently been significantly enhanced by the proliferation of extra large array architectures. The high dimensionality of these systems implies that communications take place in the nearfield regime, which poses some questions as to their effective perfomrance even under simple line of sight configurations. In order to study these limitations, a uniform linear array (ULA) is considered here, the elements of which are three infinitesimal dipoles transmitting different signals in the three spatial dimensions. The receiver consists of a single element with three orthogonal infinitesimal dipoles and full channel state information is assumed to be available at both ends. A capacity analysis is presented when the number of elements of the ULA increases without bound while the interelement distance converges to zero, so that the total aperture length is kept asymptotically fixed. In particular, the total number of available spatial eigenmodes is shown to depend crucially on the receiver position in space, and closed form expressions are provided for the different achievability regions. From the analysis it can be concluded that the use of three orthogonal polarizations at the transmitter guarantees the almost universal availability of two spatial streams, whereas the use of only two polarizations results in a more extensive region where maximum multiplexing gain is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Open Journal on Signal Processing</p></details> |
| **[SSA-Seg: Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Pixel-level Classifier for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06525v2)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vanilla pixel-level classifiers for semantic segmentation are based on a certain paradigm, involving the inner product of fixed prototypes obtained from the training set and pixel features in the test image. This approach, however, encounters significant limitations, \ie, feature deviation in the semantic domain and information loss in the spatial domain. The former struggles with large intra-class variance among pixel features from different images, while the latter fails to utilize the structured information of semantic objects effectively. This leads to blurred mask boundaries as well as a deficiency of fine-grained recognition capability. In this paper, we propose a novel Semantic and Spatial Adaptive Classifier (SSA-Seg) to address the above challenges. Specifically, we employ the coarse masks obtained from the fixed prototypes as a guide to adjust the fixed prototype towards the center of the semantic and spatial domains in the test image. The adapted prototypes in semantic and spatial domains are then simultaneously considered to accomplish classification decisions. In addition, we propose an online multi-domain distillation learning strategy to improve the adaption process. Experimental results on three publicly available benchmarks show that the proposed SSA-Seg significantly improves the segmentation performance of the baseline models with only a minimal increase in computational cost.

Despite of its significance, reliably capturing and predicting the spatial-temporal anatomic changes from a sequence of patient-specific image series presents a considerable challenge. Thus, the development of a computational framework becomes highly desirable for a multitude of practical applications. In this context, we propose a strategy of Spatial-Temporal Neural Representation learning with Prior embedding (ST-NeRP) for patient-specific imaging study. Our strategy involves leveraging an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) network to encode the image at the reference time point into a prior embedding. Subsequently, a spatial-temporally continuous deformation function is learned through another INR network. This network is trained using the whole patient-specific image sequence, enabling the prediction of deformation fields at various target time points. The efficacy of the ST-NeRP model is demonstrated through its application to diverse sequential image series, including 4D CT and longitudinal CT datasets within thoracic and abdominal imaging. The proposed ST-NeRP model exhibits substantial potential in enabling the monitoring of anatomical changes within a patient throughout the therapeutic journey.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages with 10 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |

These techniques are designed to address challenges associated with spatially correlated functional data, particularly the impact of outliers on parameter estimation. By projecting the infinite-dimensional functional predictor onto a finite-dimensional space defined by orthonormal basis functions and employing M-estimation to mitigate outlier effects, our approach improves the accuracy and reliability of parameter estimates in the spatial functional linear regression context. Simulation studies and empirical data analysis substantiate the effectiveness of our methods, while an appendix explores the Fisher consistency and influence function of the FPCA-based approach. The rfsac package in R implements these robust estimation strategies, ensuring practical applicability for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Recent advancements in large-scale auto-regressive models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various reasoning tasks. However, these models often struggle with fundamental aspects of spatial reasoning, particularly in answering questions like "Where am I?" and "What will I see?". While some attempts have been done, existing approaches typically treat them as separate tasks, failing to capture their interconnected nature. In this paper, we present Generative Spatial Transformer (GST), a novel auto-regressive framework that jointly addresses spatial localization and view prediction. Our model simultaneously estimates the camera pose from a single image and predicts the view from a new camera pose, effectively bridging the gap between spatial awareness and visual prediction. The proposed innovative camera tokenization method enables the model to learn the joint distribution of 2D projections and their corresponding spatial perspectives in an auto-regressive manner. This unified training paradigm demonstrates that joint optimization of pose estimation and novel view synthesis leads to improved performance in both tasks, for the first time, highlighting the inherent relationship between spatial awareness and visual prediction.</p></details> |  |

These models excel not only in creating fixed-size images but also in producing panoramic images. However, existing methods often struggle with spatial layout consistency when producing high-resolution panoramas, due to the lack of guidance of the global image layout. In this paper, we introduce the Multi-Scale Diffusion (MSD) framework, a plug-and-play module that extends the existing panoramic image generation framework to multiple resolution levels. By utilizing gradient descent techniques, our method effectively incorporates structural information from low-resolution images into high-resolution outputs. A comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method was conducted, comparing it with the prior works in qualitative and quantitative dimensions. The evaluation results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms others in generating coherent high-resolution panoramas.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Nonparametric Clustering Stopping Rule Based on Spatial Median](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18730v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a nonparametric clustering stopping rule algorithm based on the spatial median. Our proposed method aims to achieve the balance between the homogeneity within the clusters and the heterogeneity between clusters. The proposed algorithm maximises the ratio of the variation between clusters and the variation within clusters while adjusting for the number of clusters and number of observations. The proposed algorithm is robust against distributional assumptions and the presence of outliers. Simulations have been used to validate the algorithm. We further evaluated the stability and the efficacy of the proposed algorithm using three real-world datasets. Moreover, we compared the performance of our model with 13 other traditional algorithms for determining the number of clusters. We found that the proposed algorithm outperformed 11 of the algorithms considered for comparison in terms of clustering number determination. The finding demonstrates that the proposed method provides a reliable alternative to determine the number of clusters for multivariate data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Search for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18580v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs achieve competitive performances on benchmark tasks like image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not optimal for SNNs. In this work, we apply Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find suitable architectures for SNNs. Previous NAS methods for SNNs focus primarily on the spatial dimension, with a notable lack of consideration for the temporal dynamics that are of critical importance for SNNs. Drawing inspiration from the heterogeneity of biological neural networks, we propose a differentiable approach to optimize SNN on both spatial and temporal dimensions. At spatial level, we have developed a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based operation is optimized on both the cell and the layer level under computational constraints. We further propose a differentiable surrogate gradient search (DGS) method to evolve local SG functions independently during training. At temporal level, we explore an optimal configuration of diverse temporal dynamics on different types of spiking neurons by evolving their time constants, based on which we further develop hybrid networks combining SNN and ANN, balancing both accuracy and efficiency. Our methods achieve comparable classification performance of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracies of 96.43%, 78.96%, and 70.21%, respectively. On event-based deep stereo, our methods find optimal layer variation and surpass the accuracy of specially designed ANNs with 26$\times$ lower computational cost ($6.7\mathrm{mJ}$), demonstrating the potential of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.</p></details> |  |

Although current methods based on NeRF have achieved satisfactory performance, they still can not reach real-time levels. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered researchers attention due to their outstanding rendering quality and real-time speed. Therefore, a new paradigm has been proposed: defining a canonical 3D gaussians and deforming it to individual frames in deformable fields. However, since the coordinates of canonical 3D gaussians are filled with noise, which can transfer noise into the deformable fields, and there is currently no method that adequately considers the aggregation of 4D information. Therefore, we propose Denoised Deformable Network with Temporal-Spatial Aggregation for Dynamic Scene Rendering (DN-4DGS). Specifically, a Noise Suppression Strategy is introduced to change the distribution of the coordinates of the canonical 3D gaussians and suppress noise. Additionally, a Decoupled Temporal-Spatial Aggregation Module is designed to aggregate information from adjacent points and frames. Extensive experiments on various real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality under a real-time level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

It enables the classification of tissue samples into diverse subpopulations of cells, which, in turn, facilitates the analysis of the biological functions of clusters, tissue reconstruction, and cell-cell interactions. Many approaches leverage gene expressions, spatial locations, and histological images to detect spatial domains; however, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as state of the art models suffer from a limitation in the assumption of pairwise connections between nodes. In the case of domain detection in spatial transcriptomics, some cells are found to be not directly related. Still, they are grouped as the same domain, which shows the incapability of GNNs for capturing implicit connections among the cells. While graph edges connect only two nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes along their edges, which lets Hypergraph Neural Networks (HGNNs) capture and utilize richer and more complex structural information than traditional GNNs. We use autoencoders to address the limitation of not having the actual labels, which are well-suited for unsupervised learning. Our model has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving the highest iLISI score of 1.843 compared to other methods. This score indicates the greatest diversity of cell types identified by our method. Furthermore, our model outperforms other methods in downstream clustering, achieving the highest ARI values of 0.51 and Leiden score of 0.60.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Spatial Outliers: the Role of the Local Influence Function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18261v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the analysis of large spatial datasets, identifying and treating spatial outliers is essential for accurately interpreting geographical phenomena. While spatial correlation measures, particularly Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA), are widely used to detect spatial patterns, the presence of abnormal observations frequently distorts the landscape and conceals critical spatial relationships. These outliers can significantly impact analysis due to the inherent spatial dependencies present in the data. Traditional influence function (IF) methodologies, commonly used in statistical analysis to measure the impact of individual observations, are not directly applicable in the spatial context because the influence of an observation is determined not only by its own value but also by its spatial location, its connections with neighboring regions, and the values of those neighboring observations. In this paper, we introduce a local version of the influence function (LIF) that accounts for these spatial dependencies. Through the analysis of both simulated and real-world datasets, we demonstrate how the LIF provides a more nuanced and accurate detection of spatial outliers compared to traditional LISA measures and local impact assessments, improving our understanding of spatial patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A utility-based spatial analysis of residential street-level conditions; A case study of Rotterdam](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17880v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Residential location choices are traditionally modelled using factors related to accessibility and socioeconomic environments, neglecting the importance of local street-level conditions. Arguably, this neglect is due to data practices. Today, however, street-level images -- which are highly effective at encoding street-level conditions -- are widely available. Additionally, recent advances in discrete choice models incorporating computer vision capabilities offer opportunities to integrate street-level conditions into residential location choice analysis. This study leverages these developments to investigate the spatial distribution of utility derived from street-level conditions in residential location choices on a city-wide scale. In our case study of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, we find that the utility derived from street-level conditions varies significantly on a highly localised scale, with conditions rapidly changing even within neighbourhoods. Our results also reveal that the high real-estate prices in the city centre cannot be attributed to attractive street-level conditions. Furthermore, whereas the city centre is characterised by relatively unattractive residential street-level conditions, neighbourhoods in the southern part of the city -- often perceived as problematic -- exhibit surprisingly appealing street-level environments. The methodological contribution of this paper is that it advances the discrete choice models incorporating computer vision capabilities by introducing a semantic regularisation layer to the model. Thereby, it adds explainability and eliminates the need for a separate pipeline to extract information from images, streamlining the analysis. As such, this paper's findings and methodological advancements pave the way for further studies to explore integrating street-level conditions in urban planning.</p></details> |  |

However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks.

In particular, we tackle a challenging version of this task, where we learn from presence-only data in a community-sourced dataset, model a large number of species simultaneously, and do not use any additional environmental information. Previous work has used neural implicit representations to construct models that achieve promising results. However, implicit representations often generate predictions of limited spatial precision. We attribute this limitation to their inherently global formulation and inability to effectively capture local feature variations. This issue is especially pronounced with presence-only data and a large number of species. To address this, we propose a hybrid embedding scheme that combines both implicit and explicit embeddings. Specifically, the explicit embedding is implemented with a multiresolution hashgrid, enabling our models to better capture local information. Experiments demonstrate that our results exceed other works by a large margin on various standard benchmarks, and that the hybrid representation is better than both purely implicit and explicit ones. Qualitative visualizations and comprehensive ablation studies reveal that our hybrid representation successfully addresses the two main challenges.

HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the complex, temporally dynamic nature of endoscopic scenes. This paper presents ST-Endo4DGS, a novel framework that models the spatio-temporal volume of dynamic endoscopic scenes using unbiased 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) primitives, parameterized by anisotropic ellipses with flexible 4D rotations. This approach enables precise representation of deformable tissue dynamics, capturing intricate spatial and temporal correlations in real time. Additionally, we extend spherindrical harmonics to represent time-evolving appearance, achieving realistic adaptations to lighting and view changes. A new endoscopic normal alignment constraint (ENAC) further enhances geometric fidelity by aligning rendered normals with depth-derived geometry. Extensive evaluations show that ST-Endo4DGS outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and real-time performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction for endoscopic surgery.</p></details> |  |

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency. This work sets a benchmark for tackling complex inference tasks with heterogeneous MTS, offering a versatile, interpretable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  |

Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |

This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Identifying Spatio-Temporal Drivers of Extreme Events](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24075v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The spatio-temporal relations of impacts of extreme events and their drivers in climate data are not fully understood and there is a need of machine learning approaches to identify such spatio-temporal relations from data. The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Deciphering and Inpainting in Spatio-Temporal Dynamics via Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19608v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal (ST) prediction has garnered a De facto attention in earth sciences, such as meteorological prediction, human mobility perception. However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Hierarchical Framework with Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Emergence Detection in Complex Adaptive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10300v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Spatio-temporal encoders composed of spatial and temporal transformers are designed to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Agents' and the system's representations are learned to preserve the spatio-temporal consistency by minimizing the spatial and temporal dissimilarities in a self-supervised manner in the latent space. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic in incorporating other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |
| **[DeepMIDE: A Multivariate Spatio-Temporal Method for Ultra-Scale Offshore Wind Energy Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20166v1)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To unlock access to stronger winds, the offshore wind industry is advancing with significantly larger and taller wind turbines. This massive upscaling motivates a departure from univariate wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate, nonstationary, and state-dependent kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from future offshore wind energy sites in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting, and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated from a non-separable model with diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonomous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging the Line Graph transform, the Line Graph Least Mean Square (LGLMS) algorithm is proposed to conduct adaptive estimation of time-varying edge signals by projecting the edge signals from edge space to node space. LGLMS is an adaptive algorithm analogous to the classical LMS algorithm but applied to graph edges. Unlike edge-specific methods, LGLMS retains all GSP concepts and techniques originally designed for graph nodes, without the need for redefinition on the edges. Experimenting with transportation graphs and meteorological graphs, with the signal observations having noisy and missing values, we confirmed that LGLMS is suitable for the online prediction of time-varying edge signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Multivariate Cluster Evolution Analysis for Detecting and Tracking Climate Impacts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16544v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a growing concern about climate change and its impacts. While Earth System Models (ESMs) can be invaluable tools for studying the impacts of climate change, the complex coupling processes encoded in ESMs and the large amounts of data produced by these models, together with the high internal variability of the Earth system, can obscure important source-to-impact relationships. This paper presents a novel and efficient unsupervised data-driven approach for detecting statistically-significant impacts and tracing spatio-temporal source-impact pathways in the climate through a unique combination of ideas from anomaly detection, clustering and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Using as an exemplar the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines, we demonstrate that the proposed approach is capable of detecting known post-eruption impacts/events. We additionally describe a methodology for extracting meaningful sequences of post-eruption impacts/events by using NLP to efficiently mine frequent multivariate cluster evolutions, which can be used to confirm or discover the chain of physical processes between a climate source and its impact(s).</p></details> |  |

Similar to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), high-quality benchmark datasets are of great importance to the advances of SNNs. However, our analysis indicates that many prevalent neuromorphic datasets lack strong temporal correlation, preventing SNNs from fully exploiting their spatio-temporal representation capabilities. Meanwhile, the integration of event and frame modalities offers more comprehensive visual spatio-temporal information. Yet, the SNN-based cross-modality fusion remains underexplored. In this work, we present a neuromorphic dataset called DVS-SLR that can better exploit the inherent spatio-temporal properties of SNNs. Compared to existing datasets, it offers advantages in terms of higher temporal correlation, larger scale, and more varied scenarios. In addition, our neuromorphic dataset contains corresponding frame data, which can be used for developing SNN-based fusion methods. By virtue of the dual-modal feature of the dataset, we propose a Cross-Modality Attention (CMA) based fusion method. The CMA model efficiently utilizes the unique advantages of each modality, allowing for SNNs to learn both temporal and spatial attention scores from the spatio-temporal features of event and frame modalities, subsequently allocating these scores across modalities to enhance their synergy. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only improves recognition accuracy but also ensures robustness across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Inevitably, the issue of missing data caused by various disturbances threatens the reliability of data acquisition. Recent studies of diffusion probability models have demonstrated the superiority of deep generative models in imputation tasks by precisely capturing the spatio-temporal correlation of traffic data. One drawback of diffusion models is their slow sampling/denoising process. In this work, we aim to accelerate the imputation process while retaining the performance. We propose a fast conditional diffusion model for spatiotemporal traffic data imputation (FastSTI). To speed up the process yet, obtain better performance, we propose the application of a high-order pseudo-numerical solver. Our method further revs the imputation by introducing a predefined alignment strategy of variance schedule during the sampling process. Evaluating FastSTI on two types of real-world traffic datasets (traffic speed and flow) with different missing data scenarios proves its ability to impute higher-quality samples in only six sampling steps, especially under high missing rates (60\% $\sim$ 90\%). The experimental results illustrate a speed-up of $\textbf{8.3} \times$ faster than the current state-of-the-art model while achieving better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems for publication.

Existing techniques are often cumbersome, computationally heavy and generally suffer from limitations in wavenumber/frequency response. To address these challenges, we propose Wave (from) Polarized Light Learning (WPLL), a learning based remote sensing method for laboratory implementation, capable of inferring surface elevation and slope maps in high resolution. The method uses the polarization properties of light reflected from the water surface. The WPLL uses a deep neural network (DNN) model that approximates the water surface slopes from the polarized light intensities. Once trained on simple monochromatic wave trains, the WPLL is capable of producing high-resolution and accurate 2D reconstruction of the water surface slopes and elevation in a variety of irregular wave fields. The method's robustness is demonstrated by showcasing its high wavenumber/frequency response, its ability to reconstruct wave fields propagating at arbitrary angles relative to the camera optical axis, and its computational efficiency. This developed methodology is an accurate and cost-effective near-real time remote sensing tool for laboratory water surface waves measurements, setting the path for upscaling to open sea application for research, monitoring, and short-time forecasting.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 17 figures, 5 tables, under review in Applied Ocean Research Journal</p></details> |

To make the cooperation safe for the humans involved, the systems have to follow protocols with rigid real-time and real-space properties, but they also need to be capable of making competitive and collaborative decisions with varying rewards and penalties. Due to these tough requirements, the construction of system control software is often very difficult. This calls for applying a model-based engineering approach, which allows one to formally express the time and space properties and use them as guidance for the whole engineering process from requirement definition via system design to software development. Moreover, it is beneficial, if one can verify with acceptable effort, that the time and space requirements are preserved throughout the development steps. This paper focuses on modelling spatio-temporal properties and their model-checking and simulation using different analysis tools in combination with the methods and tool extensions proposed here.

We present a comprehensive investigation of Graph U-Nets, originally developed for classification tasks, now tailored for mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal forecasting of fluid dynamics. Our focus is on enhancing their performance through systematic hyperparameter tuning and architectural modifications. We propose novel approaches to improve mesh-agnostic spatio-temporal prediction of transient flow fields using Graph U-Nets, enabling accurate prediction on diverse mesh configurations. Key enhancements to the Graph U-Net architecture, including the Gaussian-mixture-model convolutional operator and noise injection approaches, provide increased flexibility in modeling node dynamics: the former reduces prediction error by 95\% compared to conventional convolutional operators, while the latter improves long-term prediction robustness, resulting in an error reduction of 86\%. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these enhancements in both transductive and inductive learning settings, showcasing the adaptability of Graph U-Nets to various flow conditions and mesh structures. This work contributes to the field of reduced-order modeling for computational fluid dynamics by establishing Graph U-Nets as a viable and flexible alternative to convolutional neural networks, capable of accurately and efficiently predicting complex fluid flow phenomena across diverse scenarios.</p></details> |  |

This study aims to develop a methodology for analyzing the occupancy rate from large-scale datasets to identify gaps between supply and demand in public transportation. Leveraging the spatio-temporal granularity of data from Automatic People Counting (APC) and relying on the Generalized Linear Mixed Effects Model and the Generalized Mixed-Effect Random Forest, in this study we propose a methodology for analyzing factors determining undercrowding. The results of the model are examined at both the segment and ride levels. Initially, the analysis focuses on identifying segments more likely associated with undercrowding, understanding factors influencing the probability of undercrowding, and exploring their relationships. Subsequently, the analysis extends to the temporal distribution of undercrowding, encompassing its impact on the entire journey. The proposed methodology is applied to analyze APC data, provided by the company responsible for public transport management in Milan, on a radial route of the surface transportation network.</p></details> | Pre-print version |

Although spatio-temporal graph neural networks have achieved success in modeling various static spatio-temporal forecasting scenarios, real-world spatio-temporal data are typically received in a streaming manner, and the network continuously expands with the installation of new sensors. Thus, spatio-temporal forecasting in streaming scenarios faces dual challenges: the inefficiency of retraining models over newly arrived data and the detrimental effects of catastrophic forgetting over long-term history. To address these challenges, we propose a novel prompt tuning-based continuous forecasting method, following two fundamental tuning principles guided by empirical and theoretical analysis: expand and compress, which effectively resolve the aforementioned problems with lightweight tuning parameters. Specifically, we integrate the base spatio-temporal graph neural network with a continuous prompt pool, utilizing stored prompts (i.e., few learnable parameters) in memory, and jointly optimize them with the base spatio-temporal graph neural network. This method ensures that the model sequentially learns from the spatio-temporal data stream to accomplish tasks for corresponding periods. Extensive experimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the multi-faceted superiority of our method over the state-of-the-art baselines, including effectiveness, efficiency, universality, etc.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Prompt-Guided Spatio-Temporal Transformer Model for National-Wide Nuclear Radiation Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11924v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclear radiation (NR), which refers to the energy emitted from atomic nuclei during decay, poses substantial risks to human health and environmental safety. Accurate forecasting of nuclear radiation levels is crucial for informed decision-making by both individuals and governments. However, this task is challenging due to the imbalanced distribution of monitoring stations over a wide spatial range and the non-stationary radiation variation patterns. In this study, we introduce NRFormer, an innovative framework tailored for national-wide prediction of nuclear radiation variations. By integrating a non-stationary temporal attention module, an imbalance-aware spatial attention module, and a radiation propagation prompting module, NRFormer collectively captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics of nuclear radiation. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework against seven baselines. This research not only enhances the accuracy and reliability in nuclear radiation forecasting but also contributes to advancing emergency response strategies and monitoring systems, thereby safeguarding environmental and public health.</p></details> |  |

In the human language system, experimental studies have observed clusters for syntactic and semantic categories, but the mechanisms underlying this functional organization remain unclear. Here, building on work from the vision literature, we develop TopoLM, a transformer language model with an explicit two-dimensional spatial representation of model units. By combining a next-token prediction objective with a spatial smoothness loss, representations in this model assemble into clusters that correspond to semantically interpretable groupings of text and closely match the functional organization in the brain's language system. TopoLM successfully predicts the emergence of the spatio-functional organization of a cortical language system as well as the organization of functional clusters selective for fine-grained linguistic features empirically observed in human cortex. Our results suggest that the functional organization of the human language system is driven by a unified spatial objective, and provide a functionally and spatially aligned model of language processing in the brain.</p></details> |  |

However, the restricted capturing devices and transmission bandwidth lead to the low resolution of ODVs. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods are proposed to enhance the resolution of videos, but ODV projection distortions in the application are not well addressed directly applying such methods. To achieve better super-resolution reconstruction quality, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Distortion Aware Network (STDAN) oriented to ODV characteristics. Specifically, a spatio-temporal distortion modulation module is introduced to improve spatial ODV projection distortions and exploit the temporal correlation according to intra and inter alignments. Next, we design a multi-frame reconstruction and fusion mechanism to refine the consistency of reconstructed ODV frames. Furthermore, we incorporate latitude-saliency adaptive maps in the loss function to concentrate on important viewpoint regions with higher texture complexity and human-watching interest. In addition, we collect a new ODV-SR dataset with various scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed STDAN achieves superior super-resolution performance on ODVs and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoChat: Joints-Grouped Spatio-Temporal Grounding LLM for Multi-Turn Motion Comprehension and Description](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11404v1)** | 2024-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite continuous advancements in deep learning for understanding human motion, existing models often struggle to accurately identify action timing and specific body parts, typically supporting only single-round interaction. Such limitations in capturing fine-grained motion details reduce their effectiveness in motion understanding tasks. In this paper, we propose MoChat, a multimodal large language model capable of spatio-temporal grounding of human motion and understanding multi-turn dialogue context. To achieve these capabilities, we group the spatial information of each skeleton frame based on human anatomical structure and then apply them with Joints-Grouped Skeleton Encoder, whose outputs are combined with LLM embeddings to create spatio-aware and temporal-aware embeddings separately. Additionally, we develop a pipeline for extracting timestamps from skeleton sequences based on textual annotations, and construct multi-turn dialogues for spatially grounding. Finally, various task instructions are generated for jointly training. Experimental results demonstrate that MoChat achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple metrics in motion understanding tasks, making it as the first model capable of fine-grained spatio-temporal grounding of human motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Echo State Networks for Spatio-Temporal Area-Level Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10641v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal area-level datasets play a critical role in official statistics, providing valuable insights for policy-making and regional planning. Accurate modeling and forecasting of these datasets can be extremely useful for policymakers to develop informed strategies for future planning. Echo State Networks (ESNs) are efficient methods for capturing nonlinear temporal dynamics and generating forecasts. However, ESNs lack a direct mechanism to account for the neighborhood structure inherent in area-level data. Ignoring these spatial relationships can significantly compromise the accuracy and utility of forecasts. In this paper, we incorporate approximate graph spectral filters at the input stage of the ESN, thereby improving forecast accuracy while preserving the model's computational efficiency during training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using Eurostat's tourism occupancy dataset and show how it can support more informed decision-making in policy and planning contexts.</p></details> | 23 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Get Rid of Task Isolation: A Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10524v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal learning has become a pivotal technique to enable urban intelligence. Traditional spatiotemporal models mostly focus on a specific task by assuming a same distribution between training and testing sets. However, given that urban systems are usually dynamic, multi-sourced with imbalanced data distributions, current specific task-specific models fail to generalize to new urban conditions and adapt to new domains without explicitly modeling interdependencies across various dimensions and types of urban data. To this end, we argue that there is an essential to propose a Continuous Multi-task Spatio-Temporal learning framework (CMuST) to empower collective urban intelligence, which reforms the urban spatiotemporal learning from single-domain to cooperatively multi-dimensional and multi-task learning. Specifically, CMuST proposes a new multi-dimensional spatiotemporal interaction network (MSTI) to allow cross-interactions between context and main observations as well as self-interactions within spatial and temporal aspects to be exposed, which is also the core for capturing task-level commonality and personalization. To ensure continuous task learning, a novel Rolling Adaptation training scheme (RoAda) is devised, which not only preserves task uniqueness by constructing data summarization-driven task prompts, but also harnesses correlated patterns among tasks by iterative model behavior modeling. We further establish a benchmark of three cities for multi-task spatiotemporal learning, and empirically demonstrate the superiority of CMuST via extensive evaluations on these datasets. The impressive improvements on both few-shot streaming data and new domain tasks against existing SOAT methods are achieved. Code is available at https://github.com/DILab-USTCSZ/CMuST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Graph Masked Autoencoder for Spatio-Temporal Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10915v1)** | 2024-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective spatio-temporal prediction frameworks play a crucial role in urban sensing applications, including traffic analysis, human mobility behavior modeling, and citywide crime prediction. However, the presence of data noise and label sparsity in spatio-temporal data presents significant challenges for existing neural network models in learning effective and robust region representations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel spatio-temporal graph masked autoencoder paradigm that explores generative self-supervised learning for effective spatio-temporal data augmentation. Our proposed framework introduces a spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph neural encoder that captures region-wise dependencies from heterogeneous data sources, enabling the modeling of diverse spatial dependencies. In our spatio-temporal self-supervised learning paradigm, we incorporate a masked autoencoding mechanism on node representations and structures. This mechanism automatically distills heterogeneous spatio-temporal dependencies across regions over time, enhancing the learning process of dynamic region-wise spatial correlations. To validate the effectiveness of our STGMAE framework, we conduct extensive experiments on various spatio-temporal mining tasks. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art baselines. The results of these evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework in terms of performance and its ability to address the challenges of spatial and temporal data noise and sparsity in practical urban sensing scenarios.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gridded Transformer Neural Processes for Large Unstructured Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06731v2)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important problems require modelling large-scale spatio-temporal datasets, with one prevalent example being weather forecasting. Recently, transformer-based approaches have shown great promise in a range of weather forecasting problems. However, these have mostly focused on gridded data sources, neglecting the wealth of unstructured, off-the-grid data from observational measurements such as those at weather stations. A promising family of models suitable for such tasks are neural processes (NPs), notably the family of transformer neural processes (TNPs). Although TNPs have shown promise on small spatio-temporal datasets, they are unable to scale to the quantities of data used by state-of-the-art weather and climate models. This limitation stems from their lack of efficient attention mechanisms. We address this shortcoming through the introduction of gridded pseudo-token TNPs which employ specialised encoders and decoders to handle unstructured observations and utilise a processor containing gridded pseudo-tokens that leverage efficient attention mechanisms. Our method consistently outperforms a range of strong baselines on various synthetic and real-world regression tasks involving large-scale data, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. The real-life experiments are performed on weather data, demonstrating the potential of our approach to bring performance and computational benefits when applied at scale in a weather modelling pipeline.</p></details> |  |

Enhanced by anthropogenic activities and global warming, cyanobacterial blooms are expected to increase in frequency and global distribution. Early warning systems (EWS) for cyanobacterial blooms development allow timely implementation of management measures, reducing the risks associated to these blooms. In this paper, we propose an effective EWS for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting, which uses 6 years of incomplete high-frequency spatio-temporal data from multiparametric probes, including phycocyanin (PC) fluorescence as a proxy for cyanobacteria. A probe agnostic and replicable method is proposed to pre-process the data and to generate time series specific for cyanobacterial bloom forecasting. Using these pre-processed data, six different non-site/species-specific predictive models were compared including the autoregressive and multivariate versions of Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Long-Term Short-Term (LSTM) neural networks. Results were analyzed for seven forecasting time horizons ranging from 4 to 28 days evaluated with a hybrid system that combined regression metrics (MSE, R2, MAPE) for PC values, classification metrics (Accuracy, F1, Kappa) for a proposed alarm level of 10 ug PC/L, and a forecasting-specific metric to measure prediction improvement over the displaced signal (skill). The multivariate version of LSTM showed the best and most consistent results across all forecasting horizons and metrics, achieving accuracies of up to 90% in predicting the proposed PC alarm level. Additionally, positive skill values indicated its outstanding effectiveness to forecast cyanobacterial blooms from 16 to 28 days in advance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning from Spatio-temporal Correlation for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06893v1)** | 2024-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the challenges of the semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation (SSLS) problem, particularly in low-budget scenarios. The two main issues in low-budget SSLS are the poor-quality pseudo-labels for unlabeled data, and the performance drops due to the significant imbalance between ground-truth and pseudo-labels. This imbalance leads to a vicious training cycle. To overcome these challenges, we leverage the spatio-temporal prior by recognizing the substantial overlap between temporally adjacent LiDAR scans. We propose a proximity-based label estimation, which generates highly accurate pseudo-labels for unlabeled data by utilizing semantic consistency with adjacent labeled data. Additionally, we enhance this method by progressively expanding the pseudo-labels from the nearest unlabeled scans, which helps significantly reduce errors linked to dynamic classes. Additionally, we employ a dual-branch structure to mitigate performance degradation caused by data imbalance. Experimental results demonstrate remarkable performance in low-budget settings (i.e., <= 5%) and meaningful improvements in normal budget settings (i.e., 5 - 50%). Finally, our method has achieved new state-of-the-art results on SemanticKITTI and nuScenes in semi-supervised LiDAR segmentation. With only 5% labeled data, it offers competitive results against fully-supervised counterparts. Moreover, it surpasses the performance of the previous state-of-the-art at 100% labeled data (75.2%) using only 20% of labeled data (76.0%) on nuScenes.

By leveraging real-time environmental data, JC\&S improves resource allocation, reduces latency, and enhances power efficiency, while also supporting simulations and predictive modeling. This makes it a key technology for reactive systems and digital twins. These systems can respond to environmental events in real-time, offering transformative potential in sectors like smart cities, healthcare, and Industry 5.0, where adaptive and multimodal interaction is critical to enhance real-time decision-making. In this work, we present a transformer-based architecture that processes temporal Channel State Information (CSI) data, specifically amplitude and phase, to generate 3D point clouds of indoor environments. The model utilizes a multi-head attention to capture complex spatio-temporal relationships in CSI data and is adaptable to different CSI configurations. We evaluate the architecture on the MM-Fi dataset, using two different protocols to capture human presence in indoor environments. The system demonstrates strong potential for accurate 3D reconstructions and effectively distinguishes between close and distant objects, advancing JC\&S applications for spatial sensing in future wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Different from the common penalty-based approach, this work promotes adherence to the underlying physical mechanism that facilitates statistical procedures. The motivating application concerns modeling fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, which is used for characterization of diffusion processes. We propose a physics-encoded regression model for handling spatio-temporally distributed data, which enables principled interpretability, parsimonious computation and efficient estimation by exploiting the structure of solutions of a governing evolution equation. The rate of convergence attaining the minimax optimality is theoretically demonstrated, generalizing the result obtained for the spatial regression. We conduct simulation studies to assess the performance of our proposed estimator and illustrate its usage in the aforementioned real data example.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14505v2)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications, including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring. In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series, thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy. Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.</p></details> |  |

However, multimedia technology for contact interaction is less mature than non-contact multimedia technologies and requires further development. Specialized haptic media technologies, requiring low latency and bitrates, are essential to enable haptic interaction, necessitating haptic information compression. Existing vibrotactile signal compression methods, based on the perceptual model, do not consider the characteristics of fused tactile perception at multiple spatially distributed interaction points. In fact, differences in tactile perceptual importance are not limited to conventional frequency and time domains, but also encompass differences in the spatial locations on the skin unique to tactile perception. For the most frequently used tactile information, vibrotactile texture perception, we have developed a model to predict its perceptual importance at multiple points, based on self-supervised learning and Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network. Current experimental results indicate that this model can effectively predict the perceptual importance of various points in multi-point tactile perception scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at Eurohaptics 2024</p></details> |

However, these models often struggle with balancing computational efficiency and model flexibility. To address this challenge, this study develops a fast and flexible method for STVC modeling. For enhanced flexibility in modeling, we assume multiple processes in each varying coefficient, including purely spatial, purely temporal, and spatio-temporal interaction processes with or without time cyclicity. While considering multiple processes can be time consuming, we combine a pre-conditioning method with a model selection procedure, inspired by reluctant interaction modeling. This approach allows us to computationally efficiently select and specify the latent space-time structure. Monte Carlo experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms alternatives in terms of coefficient estimation accuracy and computational efficiency. Finally, we apply the proposed method to crime analysis using a sample size of 279,360, confirming that the proposed method provides reasonable estimates of varying coefficients. The STVC model is implemented in an R package spmoran.</p></details> |  |

Effective monitoring of transformer health is critical to maintain grid stability and performance. Thermal insulation ageing is a key transformer failure mode, which is generally tracked by monitoring the hotspot temperature (HST). However, HST measurement is complex, costly, and often estimated from indirect measurements. Existing HST models focus on space-agnostic thermal models, providing worst-case HST estimates. This article introduces a spatio-temporal model for transformer winding temperature and ageing estimation, which leverages physics-based partial differential equations (PDEs) with data-driven Neural Networks (NN) in a Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) configuration to improve prediction accuracy and acquire spatio-temporal resolution. The computational accuracy of the PINN model is improved through the implementation of the Residual-Based Attention (PINN-RBA) scheme that accelerates the PINN model convergence. The PINN-RBA model is benchmarked against self-adaptive attention schemes and classical vanilla PINN configurations. For the first time, PINN based oil temperature predictions are used to estimate spatio-temporal transformer winding temperature values, validated through PDE numerical solution and fiber optic sensor measurements. Furthermore, the spatio-temporal transformer ageing model is inferred, which supports transformer health management decision-making. Results are validated with a distribution transformer operating on a floating photovoltaic power plant.</p></details> | 23 pages, 18 figures |

This allows for modeling non-linearities and interactions among predictor variables in a flexible data-driven manner and for accounting for spatio-temporal variation that is not explained by observable predictor variables. We also show how estimation and prediction can be done in a computationally efficient manner. In an application to a large U.S. mortgage credit risk data set, we find that both predictive default probabilities for individual loans and predictive loan portfolio loss distributions obtained with our novel approach are more accurate compared to conventional independent linear hazard models and also linear spatio-temporal models. Using interpretability tools for machine learning models, we find that the likely reasons for this outperformance are strong interaction and non-linear effects in the predictor variables and the presence of large spatio-temporal frailty effects.</p></details> |  |

Severity is often measured by the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) and Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS) score. However, expert MES/UCEIS annotation is time-consuming and susceptible to inter-rater variability, factors addressable by automation. Automation attempts with frame-level labels face challenges in fully-supervised solutions due to the prevalence of video-level labels in clinical trials. CNN-based weakly-supervised models (WSL) with end-to-end (e2e) training lack generalization to new disease scores and ignore spatio-temporal information crucial for accurate scoring. To address these limitations, we propose "Arges", a deep learning framework that utilizes a transformer with positional encoding to incorporate spatio-temporal information from frame features to estimate disease severity scores in endoscopy video. Extracted features are derived from a foundation model (ArgesFM), pre-trained on a large diverse dataset from multiple clinical trials (61M frames, 3927 videos). We evaluate four UC disease severity scores, including MES and three UCEIS component scores. Test set evaluation indicates significant improvements, with F1 scores increasing by 4.1% for MES and 18.8%, 6.6%, 3.8% for the three UCEIS component scores compared to state-of-the-art methods. Prospective validation on previously unseen clinical trial data further demonstrates the model's successful generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables, accepted at MLMI, MICCAI</p></details> |

Existing approaches tackle different tasks independently, tailoring their models to unique task characteristics. These methods, however, fall short of modeling intrinsic uncertainties in the spatio-temporal data. Meanwhile, their specialized designs misalign with the current research efforts toward unifying spatio-temporal graph learning solutions. In this paper, we propose to model these tasks in a unified probabilistic perspective, viewing them as predictions based on conditional information with shared dependencies. Based on this proposal, we introduce Unified Spatio-Temporal Diffusion Models (USTD) to address the tasks uniformly under the uncertainty-aware diffusion framework. USTD is holistically designed, comprising a shared spatio-temporal encoder and attention-based denoising decoders that are task-specific. The encoder, optimized by pre-training strategies, effectively captures conditional spatio-temporal patterns. The decoders, utilizing attention mechanisms, generate predictions by leveraging learned patterns. Opting for forecasting and kriging, the decoders are designed as Spatial Gated Attention (SGA) and Temporal Gated Attention (TGA) for each task, with different emphases on the spatial and temporal dimensions. Combining the advantages of deterministic encoders and probabilistic decoders, USTD achieves state-of-the-art performances compared to both deterministic and probabilistic baselines, while also providing valuable uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

Our proposed method applies DETR to each frame and uses feature shift to incorporate temporal information. However, DETR's object queries in each frame may correspond to different objects, making a simple feature shift ineffective. To overcome this issue, we propose query matching across different frames, ensuring that queries for the same object are matched and used for the feature shift. Experimental results show that performance on the JHMDB21 dataset improves significantly when query features are shifted using the proposed query matching.</p></details> |  |

The complexity of the underlying systems often makes finding the optimal decision challenging, especially when the safety-critical system is time-varying. Overcoming the problem of optimizing an unknown time-varying reward subject to unknown time-varying safety constraints, we propose TVSafeOpt, a new algorithm built on Bayesian optimization with a spatio-temporal kernel. The algorithm is capable of safely tracking a time-varying safe region without the need for explicit change detection. Optimality guarantees are also provided for the algorithm when the optimization problem becomes stationary. We show that TVSafeOpt compares favorably against SafeOpt on synthetic data, both regarding safety and optimality. Evaluation on a realistic case study with gas compressors confirms that TVSafeOpt ensures safety when solving time-varying optimization problems with unknown reward and safety functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Existing RGB-E tracking methods model event characteristics utilising attention mechanism of Transformer before integrating both modalities. Nevertheless, these methods involve aggregating the event stream into a single event frame, lacking the utilisation of the temporal information inherent in the event stream.Moreover, the traditional attention mechanism is well-suited for dense semantic features, while the attention mechanism for sparse event features require revolution. In this paper, we propose a dynamic event subframe splitting strategy to split the event stream into more fine-grained event clusters, aiming to capture spatio-temporal features that contain motion cues. Based on this, we design an event-based sparse attention mechanism to enhance the interaction of event features in temporal and spatial dimensions. The experimental results indicate that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the FE240 and COESOT datasets, providing an effective processing manner for the event data.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

Recently, several automated spatio-temporal forecasting methods have been proposed to automatically search the optimal neural network architecture for capturing complex spatio-temporal dependencies. However, the existing automated approaches suffer from expensive neural architecture search overhead, which hinders their practical use and the further exploration of diverse spatio-temporal operators in a finer granularity. In this paper, we propose AutoSTF, a decoupled automatic neural architecture search framework for cost-effective automated spatio-temporal forecasting. From the efficiency perspective, we first decouple the mixed search space into temporal space and spatial space and respectively devise representation compression and parameter-sharing schemes to mitigate the parameter explosion. The decoupled spatio-temporal search not only expedites the model optimization process but also leaves new room for more effective spatio-temporal dependency modeling. From the effectiveness perspective, we propose a multi-patch transfer module to jointly capture multi-granularity temporal dependencies and extend the spatial search space to enable finer-grained layer-wise spatial dependency search. Extensive experiments on eight datasets demonstrate the superiority of AutoSTF in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, our proposed method achieves up to 13.48x speed-up compared to state-of-the-art automatic spatio-temporal forecasting methods while maintaining the best forecasting accuracy.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Automated Spatio-Temporal Weather Modeling for Load Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16326v1)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electricity is difficult to store, except at prohibitive cost, and therefore the balance between generation and load must be maintained at all times. Electricity is traditionally managed by anticipating demand and intermittent production (wind, solar) and matching flexible production (hydro, nuclear, coal and gas). Accurate forecasting of electricity load and renewable production is therefore essential to ensure grid performance and stability. Both are highly dependent on meteorological variables (temperature, wind, sunshine). These dependencies are complex and difficult to model. On the one hand, spatial variations do not have a uniform impact because population, industry, and wind and solar farms are not evenly distributed across the territory. On the other hand, temporal variations can have delayed effects on load (due to the thermal inertia of buildings). With access to observations from different weather stations and simulated data from meteorological models, we believe that both phenomena can be modeled together. In today's state-of-the-art load forecasting models, the spatio-temporal modeling of the weather is fixed. In this work, we aim to take advantage of the automated representation and spatio-temporal feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks to improve spatio-temporal weather modeling for load forecasting. We compare our deep learning-based methodology with the state-of-the-art on French national load. This methodology could also be fully adapted to forecasting renewable energy production.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Motion Retargeting for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11557v2)** | 2024-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a motion retargeting approach for legged robots, which aims to create motion controllers that imitate the fine behavior of animals. Our approach, namely spatio-temporal motion retargeting (STMR), guides imitation learning procedures by transferring motion from source to target, effectively bridging the morphological disparities by ensuring the feasibility of imitation on the target system. Our STMR method comprises two components: spatial motion retargeting (SMR) and temporal motion retargeting (TMR). On the one hand, SMR tackles motion retargeting at the kinematic level by generating kinematically feasible whole-body motions from keypoint trajectories. On the other hand, TMR aims to retarget motion at the dynamic level by optimizing motion in the temporal domain. We showcase the effectiveness of our method in facilitating Imitation Learning (IL) for complex animal movements through a series of simulation and hardware experiments. In these experiments, our STMR method successfully tailored complex animal motions from various media, including video captured by a hand-held camera, to fit the morphology and physical properties of the target robots. This enabled RL policy training for precise motion tracking, while baseline methods struggled with highly dynamic motion involving flying phases. Moreover, we validated that the control policy can successfully imitate six different motions in two quadruped robots with different dimensions and physical properties in real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, videos available at https://terry97-guel.github.io/STMR-RL.github.io/</p></details> |

Traditional rPPG models often struggle with poor generalization capacity in unseen domains. Current solutions to this problem is to improve its generalization in the target domain through Domain Generalization (DG) or Domain Adaptation (DA). However, both traditional methods require access to both source domain data and target domain data, which cannot be implemented in scenarios with limited access to source data, and another issue is the privacy of accessing source domain data. In this paper, we propose the first Source-free Domain Adaptation benchmark for rPPG measurement (SFDA-rPPG), which overcomes these limitations by enabling effective domain adaptation without access to source domain data. Our framework incorporates a Three-Branch Spatio-Temporal Consistency Network (TSTC-Net) to enhance feature consistency across domains. Furthermore, we propose a new rPPG distribution alignment loss based on the Frequency-domain Wasserstein Distance (FWD), which leverages optimal transport to align power spectrum distributions across domains effectively and further enforces the alignment of the three branches. Extensive cross-domain experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in source-free domain adaptation settings. Our findings highlight the significant contribution of the proposed FWD loss for distributional alignment, providing a valuable reference for future research and applications.

| **[EventAug: Multifaceted Spatio-Temporal Data Augmentation Methods for Event-based Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11813v1)** | 2024-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The event camera has demonstrated significant success across a wide range of areas due to its low time latency and high dynamic range. However, the community faces challenges such as data deficiency and limited diversity, often resulting in over-fitting and inadequate feature learning. Notably, the exploration of data augmentation techniques in the event community remains scarce. This work aims to address this gap by introducing a systematic augmentation scheme named EventAug to enrich spatial-temporal diversity. In particular, we first propose Multi-scale Temporal Integration (MSTI) to diversify the motion speed of objects, then introduce Spatial-salient Event Mask (SSEM) and Temporal-salient Event Mask (TSEM) to enrich object variants. Our EventAug can facilitate models learning with richer motion patterns, object variants and local spatio-temporal relations, thus improving model robustness to varied moving speeds, occlusions, and action disruptions. Experiment results show that our augmentation method consistently yields significant improvements across different tasks and backbones (e.g., a 4.87% accuracy gain on DVS128 Gesture). Our code will be publicly available for this community.</p></details> |  |

The proposed model can simplify the parameterization by using network structure in data, and can capture the asymmetric property in dynamic volatility by adopting a threshold structure. The proposed model assumes the conditional distribution is Poisson distribution. Asymptotic theory of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for the spatial model is derived when both sample size and network dimension are large. We obtain asymptotic statistical inferences via investigation of the weak dependence of components of the model and application of limit theorems for weakly dependent random fields. Simulation studies and a real data example are presented to support our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[STCMOT: Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Learning for UAV-Based Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11234v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple object tracking (MOT) in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) videos is important for diverse applications in computer vision. Current MOT trackers rely on accurate object detection results and precise matching of target reidentification (ReID). These methods focus on optimizing target spatial attributes while overlooking temporal cues in modelling object relationships, especially for challenging tracking conditions such as object deformation and blurring, etc. To address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a novel Spatio-Temporal Cohesion Multiple Object Tracking framework (STCMOT), which utilizes historical embedding features to model the representation of ReID and detection features in a sequential order. Concretely, a temporal embedding boosting module is introduced to enhance the discriminability of individual embedding based on adjacent frame cooperation. While the trajectory embedding is then propagated by a temporal detection refinement module to mine salient target locations in the temporal field. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone2019 and UAVDT datasets demonstrate our STCMOT sets a new state-of-the-art performance in MOTA and IDF1 metrics.

| **[Spatio-Temporal-Network Point Processes for Modeling Crime Events with Landmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10882v1)** | 2024-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-exciting point processes are widely used to model the contagious effects of crime events living within continuous geographic space, using their occurrence time and locations. However, in urban environments, most events are naturally constrained within the city's street network structure, and the contagious effects of crime are governed by such a network geography. Meanwhile, the complex distribution of urban infrastructures also plays an important role in shaping crime patterns across space. We introduce a novel spatio-temporal-network point process framework for crime modeling that integrates these urban environmental characteristics by incorporating self-attention graph neural networks. Our framework incorporates the street network structure as the underlying event space, where crime events can occur at random locations on the network edges. To realistically capture criminal movement patterns, distances between events are measured using street network distances. We then propose a new mark for a crime event by concatenating the event's crime category with the type of its nearby landmark, aiming to capture how the urban design influences the mixing structures of various crime types. A graph attention network architecture is adopted to learn the existence of mark-to-mark interactions. Extensive experiments on crime data from Valencia, Spain, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in understanding the crime landscape and forecasting crime risks across regions.</p></details> |  |

While limiting the variety of training data can make training easier, it can also lead to a lack of knowledge and information for the model, resulting in a decrease in performance. To address this challenge, we presented an innovative paradigm that incorporates three separate forms of curriculum learning specifically targeting from spatial, temporal, and quantile perspectives. Furthermore, our framework incorporates a stacking fusion module to combine diverse information from three types of curriculum learning, resulting in a strong and thorough learning process. We demonstrated the effectiveness of this framework with extensive empirical evaluations, highlighting its better performance in addressing complex ST challenges. We provided thorough ablation studies to investigate the effectiveness of our curriculum and to explain how it contributes to the improvement of learning efficiency on ST data.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept by sigspatial 2024</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider the global task as a conjunction of independent and collaborative tasks, defined over the absolute and relative states of agent pairs. Task dependencies in this form are then represented by a task graph, which we assume to be acyclic. From the given task graph, we provide an algorithmic approach to define a distributed sampled-data controller prioritizing the fulfilment of collaborative tasks as the primary objective, while fulfilling independent tasks unless they conflict with collaborative ones. Moreover, communication maintenance among collaborating agents is seamlessly enforced within the proposed control framework. A numerical simulation is provided to showcase the potential of our control framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short version of this paper was accepted for the Conference on Decision and Control.

However, scalability and generalization challenges remain significant obstacles. Advanced models often rely on Graph Neural Networks to encode spatial and temporal correlations, but struggle with the increased complexity of large-scale datasets. The recursive GNN-based message passing schemes used in these models hinder their training and deployment in real-life urban sensing scenarios. Moreover, long-spanning large-scale spatio-temporal data introduce distribution shifts, necessitating improved generalization performance. To address these challenges, we propose a simple framework for spatio-temporal prediction - EasyST paradigm. It learns lightweight and robust Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) by effectively distilling knowledge from complex spatio-temporal GNNs. We ensure robust knowledge distillation by integrating the spatio-temporal information bottleneck with teacher-bounded regression loss, filtering out task-irrelevant noise and avoiding erroneous guidance. We further enhance the generalization ability of the student model by incorporating spatial and temporal prompts to provide downstream task contexts. Evaluation on three spatio-temporal datasets for urban computing tasks demonstrates that EasyST surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The implementation code is available at: https://github.com/HKUDS/EasyST.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM'2024, full paper</p></details> |
| **[A general reduced-order neural operator for spatio-temporal predictive learning on complex spatial domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05508v1)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive learning for spatio-temporal processes (PL-STP) on complex spatial domains plays a critical role in various scientific and engineering fields, with its essence being the construction of operators between infinite-dimensional function spaces. This paper focuses on the unequal-domain mappings in PL-STP and categorising them into increase-domain and decrease-domain mapping. Recent advances in deep learning have revealed the great potential of neural operators (NOs) to learn operators directly from observational data. However, existing NOs require input space and output space to be the same domain, which pose challenges in ensuring predictive accuracy and stability for unequal-domain mappings. To this end, this study presents a general reduced-order neural operator named Reduced-Order Neural Operator on Riemannian Manifolds (RO-NORM), which consists of two parts: the unequal-domain encoder/decoder and the same-domain approximator. Motivated by the variable separation in classical modal decomposition, the unequal-domain encoder/decoder uses the pre-computed bases to reformulate the spatio-temporal function as a sum of products between spatial (or temporal) bases and corresponding temporally (or spatially) distributed weight functions, thus the original unequal-domain mapping can be converted into a same-domain mapping. Consequently, the same-domain approximator NORM is applied to model the transformed mapping. The performance of our proposed method has been evaluated on six benchmark cases, including parametric PDEs, engineering and biomedical applications, and compared with four baseline algorithms: DeepONet, POD-DeepONet, PCA-Net, and vanilla NORM. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of RO-NORM in prediction accuracy and training efficiency for PL-STP.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02523v4)** | 2024-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately detecting student behavior from classroom videos is beneficial for analyzing their classroom status and improving teaching efficiency. However, low accuracy in student classroom behavior detection is a prevalent issue. To address this issue, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Attention-Based Method for Detecting Student Classroom Behaviors (BDSTA). Firstly, the SlowFast network is used to generate motion and environmental information feature maps from the video. Then, the spatio-temporal attention module is applied to the feature maps, including information aggregation, compression and stimulation processes. Subsequently, attention maps in the time, channel and space dimensions are obtained, and multi-label behavior classification is performed based on these attention maps. To solve the long-tail data problem that exists in student classroom behavior datasets, we use an improved focal loss function to assign more weight to the tail class data during training. Experimental results are conducted on a self-made student classroom behavior dataset named STSCB. Compared with the SlowFast model, the average accuracy of student behavior classification detection improves by 8.94\% using BDSTA.</p></details> |  |

However, the lack of publicly available spatio-temporal datasets on student behavior, as well as the high cost of manually labeling such datasets, pose significant challenges for researchers in this field. To address this issue, we proposed a method for extending the spatio-temporal behavior dataset in Student Classroom Scenarios (SCB-ST-Dataset4) through image dataset. Our SCB-ST-Dataset4 comprises 757265 images with 25810 labels, focusing on 3 behaviors: hand-raising, reading, writing. Our proposed method can rapidly generate spatio-temporal behavior datasets without requiring extra manual labeling. Furthermore, we proposed a Behavior Similarity Index (BSI) to explore the similarity of behaviors. We evaluated the dataset using the YOLOv5, YOLOv7, YOLOv8, and SlowFast algorithms, achieving a mean average precision (map) of up to 82.3%. Last, we fused multiple models to generate student behavior-related data from various perspectives. The experiment further demonstrates the effectiveness of our method. And SCB-ST-Dataset4 provides a robust foundation for future research in student behavior detection, potentially contributing to advancements in this field.

Developing techniques to identify and analyze communities in these time-varying graph structures is an important challenge. In this work, we generalize existing spectral clustering algorithms from static to dynamic graphs using canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to capture the temporal evolution of clusters. Based on this extended canonical correlation framework, we define the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian and investigate its spectral properties. We connect these concepts to dynamical systems theory via transfer operators, and illustrate the advantages of our method on benchmark graphs by comparison with existing methods. We show that the spatio-temporal graph Laplacian allows for a clear interpretation of cluster structure evolution over time for directed and undirected graphs.</p></details> |  |

A critical component of disease behavior is the velocity with which disease spreads, defined as the rate of change between time and space. In this paper, we propose a spatio-temporal modeling approach to determine the velocities of infectious disease spread. Our approach assumes that the locations and times of people infected can be considered as a spatio-temporal point pattern that arises as a realization of a spatio-temporal log-Gaussian Cox process. The intensity of this process is estimated using fast Bayesian inference by employing the integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) and the Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) approaches. The velocity is then calculated using finite differences that approximate the derivatives of the intensity function. Finally, the directions and magnitudes of the velocities can be mapped at specific times to examine better the spread of the disease throughout the region. We demonstrate our method by analyzing COVID-19 spread in Cali, Colombia, during the 2020-2021 pandemic.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 46 figures, Journal American Statistican, submitted on 3rd of September</p></details> |

A video tutorial for this library is available on YouTube. We consider two types of methods to estimate a non-homogeneous Poisson process in space and time. The methods approximate the arrival intensity function of the Poisson process by discretizing space and time, and estimating arrival intensity as a function of subregion and time interval. With such methods, it is typical that the dimension of the estimator is large relative to the amount of data, and therefore the performance of the estimator can be improved by using additional data. The first method uses additional data to add a regularization term to the likelihood function for calibrating the intensity of the Poisson process. The second method uses additional data to estimate arrival intensity as a function of covariates. We describe a Python package to perform various types of space and time discretization. We also describe two packages for the calibration of the models, one in Matlab and one in C++. We demonstrate the advantages of our methods compared to basic maximum likelihood estimation with simulated and real data. The experiments with real data calibrate models of the arrival process of emergencies to be handled by the Rio de Janeiro emergency medical service.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the forecasting models have employed multi-source data as the multi-modality input, thus improving the prediction accuracy. However, the prevailing methods usually suffer from the desynchronization of multi-source variables, the insufficient capability of capturing spatio-temporal dependency, and unsatisfactory performance in predicting extreme precipitation events. To fix these problems, we propose a short-term precipitation forecasting model based on spatio-temporal alignment attention, with SATA as the temporal alignment module and STAU as the spatio-temporal feature extractor to filter high-pass features from precipitation signals and capture multi-term temporal dependencies. Based on satellite and ERA5 data from the southwestern region of China, our model achieves improvements of 12.61\% in terms of RMSE, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

Designing spatio-temporal forecasting models separately in a task-wise and city-wise manner to forecast demand and supply-demand gap in a ride-hailing system poses a burden for the expanding transportation network companies. Therefore, a multi-task learning architecture is proposed in this study by developing gated ensemble of spatio-temporal mixture of experts network (GESME-Net) with convolutional recurrent neural network (CRNN), convolutional neural network (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN) for simultaneously forecasting these spatio-temporal tasks in a city as well as across different cities. Furthermore, a task adaptation layer is integrated with the architecture for learning joint representation in multi-task learning and revealing the contribution of the input features utilized in prediction. The proposed architecture is tested with data from Didi Chuxing for: (i) simultaneously forecasting demand and supply-demand gap in Beijing, and (ii) simultaneously forecasting demand across Chengdu and Xian. In both scenarios, models from our proposed architecture outperformed the single-task and multi-task deep learning benchmarks and ensemble-based machine learning algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.08868</p></details> |

Although adopting a surrogate gradient (SG) makes the non-differentiability SNN trainable, achieving comparable accuracy for ANNs and keeping low-power features simultaneously is still tricky. In this paper, we proposed an energy-efficient spike-train level spiking neural network with spatio-temporal conversion, which has low computational cost and high accuracy. In the STCSNN, spatio-temporal conversion blocks (STCBs) are proposed to keep the low power features of SNNs and improve accuracy. However, STCSNN cannot adopt backpropagation algorithms directly due to the non-differentiability nature of spike trains. We proposed a suitable learning rule for STCSNNs by deducing the equivalent gradient of STCB. We evaluate the proposed STCSNN on static and neuromorphic datasets, including Fashion-Mnist, Cifar10, Cifar100, TinyImageNet, and DVS-Cifar10. The experiment results show that our proposed STCSNN outperforms the state-of-the-art accuracy on nearly all datasets, using fewer time steps and being highly energy-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Neurocomputing on 10 August 2024</p></details> |

It consists of a pyramid structure with a spatial information reuse strategy, a sequential pose initialization module, a gated hierarchical pose refinement module, and a temporal feature propagation module. First, spatial features are encoded using a point feature pyramid, with features reused in successive pose estimations to reduce computational overhead. Second, a sequential pose initialization method is introduced, leveraging the high-frequency sampling characteristic of LiDAR to initialize the LiDAR pose. Then, a gated hierarchical pose refinement mechanism refines poses from coarse to fine by selectively retaining or discarding motion information from different layers based on gate estimations. Finally, temporal feature propagation is proposed to incorporate the historical motion information from point cloud sequences, and address the spatial inconsistency issue when transmitting motion information embedded in point clouds between frames. Experimental results on the KITTI odometry dataset and Argoverse dataset demonstrate that DSLO outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving at least a 15.67\% improvement on RTE and a 12.64\% improvement on RRE, while also achieving a 34.69\% reduction in runtime compared to baseline methods.

However, existing methods encounter difficulties when applied to problems on unstructured grids and irregular domains. Spatial graph neural networks utilize local convolution in a neighborhood to potentially address these challenges, yet they often suffer from issues such as over-smoothing and over-squashing in deep architectures. Conversely, spectral graph neural networks leverage global convolution to capture extensive features and long-range dependencies in domain graphs, albeit at a high computational cost due to Eigenvalue decomposition. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach, referred to as Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator (Sp$^2$GNO) that integrates spatial and spectral GNNs effectively. This framework mitigates the limitations of individual methods and enables the learning of solution operators across arbitrary geometries, thus catering to a wide range of real-world problems. Sp$^2$GNO demonstrates exceptional performance in solving both time-dependent and time-independent partial differential equations on regular and irregular domains. Our approach is validated through comprehensive benchmarks and practical applications drawn from computational mechanics and scientific computing literature.</p></details> |  |

These hybrid models typically arrange the spatial and temporal learning components in series. A pioneering effort to jointly model the spatio-temporal dependencies using only GNNs was the introduction of the Block Adjacency Matrix \(\mathbf{A_B}\) \cite{1}, which was constructed by diagonally concatenating adjacency matrices from graphs at different time steps. This approach resulted in a single graph encompassing complete spatio-temporal data; however, the graphs from different time steps remained disconnected, limiting GNN message-passing to spatially connected nodes only. Addressing this critical challenge, we propose a novel end-to-end learning architecture specifically designed to mend the temporal dependencies, resulting in a well-connected graph. Thus, we provide a framework for the learnable representation of spatio-temporal data as graphs. Our methodology demonstrates superior performance on benchmark datasets, such as SurgVisDom and C2D2, surpassing existing state-of-the-art graph models in terms of accuracy. Our model also achieves significantly lower computational complexity, having far fewer parameters than methods reliant on CLIP and 3D CNN architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICONIP 2024</p></details> |

However, these networks often face challenges in training due to the high annotation cost. To address this, unsupervised and weakly-supervised methods have been developed to reduce the dependency on annotations. This work introduces a novel weakly-supervised method called Eigen-cluster VIS that, without requiring any mask annotations, achieves competitive accuracy compared to other VIS approaches. This method is based on two key innovations: a Temporal Eigenvalue Loss (TEL) and a clip-level Quality Cluster Coefficient (QCC). The TEL ensures temporal coherence by leveraging the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix derived from graph adjacency matrices. By minimizing the mean absolute error (MAE) between the eigenvalues of adjacent frames, this loss function promotes smooth transitions and stable segmentation boundaries over time, reducing temporal discontinuities and improving overall segmentation quality. The QCC employs the K-means method to ensure the quality of spatio-temporal clusters without relying on ground truth masks. Using the Davies-Bouldin score, the QCC provides an unsupervised measure of feature discrimination, allowing the model to self-evaluate and adapt to varying object distributions, enhancing robustness during the testing phase. These enhancements are computationally efficient and straightforward, offering significant performance gains without additional annotated data. The proposed Eigen-Cluster VIS method is evaluated on the YouTube-VIS 2019/2021 and OVIS datasets, demonstrating that it effectively narrows the performance gap between the fully-supervised and weakly-supervised VIS approaches.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel at modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability to directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN, a novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN leverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously incorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This is achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation of physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings demonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting models (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like PedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These datasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN effectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various domains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the way for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease outbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Context Prompting for Zero-Shot Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15996v2)** | 2024-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal action detection encompasses the tasks of localizing and classifying individual actions within a video. Recent works aim to enhance this process by incorporating interaction modeling, which captures the relationship between people and their surrounding context. However, these approaches have primarily focused on fully-supervised learning, and the current limitation lies in the lack of generalization capability to recognize unseen action categories. In this paper, we aim to adapt the pretrained image-language models to detect unseen actions. To this end, we propose a method which can effectively leverage the rich knowledge of visual-language models to perform Person-Context Interaction. Meanwhile, our Context Prompting module will utilize contextual information to prompt labels, thereby enhancing the generation of more representative text features. Moreover, to address the challenge of recognizing distinct actions by multiple people at the same timestamp, we design the Interest Token Spotting mechanism which employs pretrained visual knowledge to find each person's interest context tokens, and then these tokens will be used for prompting to generate text features tailored to each individual. To evaluate the ability to detect unseen actions, we propose a comprehensive benchmark on J-HMDB, UCF101-24, and AVA datasets. The experiments show that our method achieves superior results compared to previous approaches and can be further extended to multi-action videos, bringing it closer to real-world applications.

| **[Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process Involving a Dynamic Graph Neural Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03469v2)** | 2024-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) have recently become increasingly interesting for learning dynamics in graph data. A reason for this is that learning on dynamic graph data is becoming more relevant, since data from many scientific fields, ranging from mathematics, biology, social sciences, and physics to computer science, is naturally related and inherently dynamic. In addition, TPPs provide a meaningful characterization of event streams and a prediction mechanism for future events. Therefore, (semi-)parameterized Neural TPPs have been introduced whose characterization can be (partially) learned and, thus, enable the representation of more complex phenomena. However, the research on modeling dynamic graphs with TPPs is relatively young, and only a few models for node attribute changes or evolving edges have been proposed yet. To allow for learning on fully dynamic graph streams, i.e., graphs that can change in their structure (addition/deletion of nodes/edge) and in their node/edge attributes, we propose a Marked Neural Spatio-Temporal Point Process (MNSTPP). It leverages a Dynamic Graph Neural Network to learn a Marked TPP that handles attributes and spatial data to model and predict any event in a graph stream.</p></details> |  |

Human-centric VAD, a specialized area within this domain, faces additional complexities, including variations in human behavior, potential biases in data, and substantial privacy concerns related to human subjects. These issues complicate the development of models that are both robust and generalizable. To address these challenges, recent advancements have focused on pose-based VAD, which leverages human pose as a high-level feature to mitigate privacy concerns, reduce appearance biases, and minimize background interference. In this paper, we introduce PoseWatch, a novel transformer-based architecture designed specifically for human-centric pose-based VAD. PoseWatch features an innovative Spatio-Temporal Pose and Relative Pose (ST-PRP) tokenization method that enhances the representation of human motion over time, which is also beneficial for broader human behavior analysis tasks. The architecture's core, a Unified Encoder Twin Decoders (UETD) transformer, significantly improves the detection of anomalous behaviors in video data. Extensive evaluations across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PoseWatch consistently outperforms existing methods, establishing a new state-of-the-art in pose-based VAD. This work not only demonstrates the efficacy of PoseWatch but also highlights the potential of integrating Natural Language Processing techniques with computer vision to advance human behavior analysis.</p></details> |  |

Traditional forecasting methods, however, struggle with the irregular traffic time series resulting from adaptive traffic signal controls, presenting challenges in asynchronous spatial dependency, irregular temporal dependency, and predicting variable-length sequences. To this end, we propose an Asynchronous Spatio-tEmporal graph convolutional nEtwoRk (ASeer) tailored for irregular traffic time series forecasting. Specifically, we first propose an Asynchronous Graph Diffusion Network to capture the spatial dependency between asynchronously measured traffic states regulated by adaptive traffic signals. After that, to capture the temporal dependency within irregular traffic state sequences, a personalized time encoding is devised to embed the continuous time signals. Then, we propose a Transformable Time-aware Convolution Network, which adapts meta-filters for time-aware convolution on the sequences with inconsistent temporal flow. Additionally, a Semi-Autoregressive Prediction Network, comprising a state evolution unit and a semi-autoregressive predictor, is designed to predict variable-length traffic sequences effectively and efficiently. Extensive experiments on a newly established benchmark demonstrate the superiority of ASeer compared with twelve competitive baselines across six metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is published in the research track of KDD 2024</p></details> |

However, existing methods are limited by their ability to handle large, complex datasets. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of open-source large and small-scale language models (LLMs and LMs) with traditional forecasting methods. We augment traditional methods with dynamic prompting and a grouped-query, multi-head attention mechanism to more effectively capture both intra-series and inter-series dependencies in evolving nonlinear time series data. In addition, we facilitate on-premises customization by fine-tuning smaller open-source LMs for time series trend analysis utilizing descriptions generated by open-source large LMs on consumer-grade hardware using Low-Rank Adaptation with Activation Memory Reduction (LoRA-AMR) technique to reduce computational overhead and activation storage memory demands while preserving inference latency. We combine language model processing for time series trend analysis with traditional time series representation learning method for cross-modal integration, achieving robust and accurate forecasts. The framework effectiveness is demonstrated through extensive experiments on various real-world datasets, outperforming existing methods by significant margins in terms of forecast accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper published at the Deployable AI (DAI) workshop at AAAI-2024</p></details> |

Although various neural networks with intricate architectures have been developed to address this problem, they still face two key challenges: i) Recent advancements in network designs for modeling spatio-temporal correlations are starting to see diminishing returns in performance enhancements. ii) Additionally, most models do not account for the spatio-temporal heterogeneity inherent in traffic data, i.e., traffic distribution varies significantly across different regions and traffic flow patterns fluctuate across various time slots. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Graph Transformer (STGormer), which effectively integrates attribute and structure information inherent in traffic data for learning spatio-temporal correlations, and a mixture-of-experts module for capturing heterogeneity along spaital and temporal axes. Specifically, we design two straightforward yet effective spatial encoding methods based on the graph structure and integrate time position encoding into the vanilla transformer to capture spatio-temporal traffic patterns. Additionally, a mixture-of-experts enhanced feedforward neural network (FNN) module adaptively assigns suitable expert layers to distinct patterns via a spatio-temporal gating network, further improving overall prediction accuracy. Experiments on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STGormer achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Causally-Aware Spatio-Temporal Multi-Graph Convolution Network for Accurate and Reliable Traffic Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13293v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and reliable prediction has profound implications to a wide range of applications. In this study, we focus on an instance of spatio-temporal learning problem--traffic prediction--to demonstrate an advanced deep learning model developed for making accurate and reliable forecast. Despite the significant progress in traffic prediction, limited studies have incorporated both explicit and implicit traffic patterns simultaneously to improve prediction performance. Meanwhile, the variability nature of traffic states necessitates quantifying the uncertainty of model predictions in a statistically principled way; however, extant studies offer no provable guarantee on the statistical validity of confidence intervals in reflecting its actual likelihood of containing the ground truth. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end traffic prediction framework that leverages three primary components to generate accurate and reliable traffic predictions: dynamic causal structure learning for discovering implicit traffic patterns from massive traffic data, causally-aware spatio-temporal multi-graph convolution network (CASTMGCN) for learning spatio-temporal dependencies, and conformal prediction for uncertainty quantification. CASTMGCN fuses several graphs that characterize different important aspects of traffic networks and an auxiliary graph that captures the effect of exogenous factors on the road network. On this basis, a conformal prediction approach tailored to spatio-temporal data is further developed for quantifying the uncertainty in node-wise traffic predictions over varying prediction horizons. Experimental results on two real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms several state-of-the-art models in prediction accuracy; moreover, it generates more efficient prediction regions than other methods while strictly satisfying the statistical validity in coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Road Traffic Prediction using Real-time Regional Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12882v1)** | 2024-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For traffic prediction in transportation services such as car-sharing and ride-hailing, mid-term road traffic prediction (within a few hours) is considered essential. However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has mainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent roads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts have been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road characteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction. However, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of road-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine such knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time region-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access traces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic convolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform attention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this embedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model. Experimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model outperforms the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Geolocation Representation from Large Language Models are Generic Enhancers for Spatio-Temporal Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12116v1)** | 2024-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the geospatial domain, universal representation models are significantly less prevalent than their extensive use in natural language processing and computer vision. This discrepancy arises primarily from the high costs associated with the input of existing representation models, which often require street views and mobility data. To address this, we develop a novel, training-free method that leverages large language models (LLMs) and auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap to derive geolocation representations (LLMGeovec). LLMGeovec can represent the geographic semantics of city, country, and global scales, which acts as a generic enhancer for spatio-temporal learning. Specifically, by direct feature concatenation, we introduce a simple yet effective paradigm for enhancing multiple spatio-temporal tasks including geographic prediction (GP), long-term time series forecasting (LTSF), and graph-based spatio-temporal forecasting (GSTF). LLMGeovec can seamlessly integrate into a wide spectrum of spatio-temporal learning models, providing immediate enhancements. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMGeovec achieves global coverage and significantly boosts the performance of leading GP, LTSF, and GSTF models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOAP: Enhancing Spatio-Temporal Relation and Motion Information Capturing for Few-Shot Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16344v3)** | 2024-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High frame-rate (HFR) videos of action recognition improve fine-grained expression while reducing the spatio-temporal relation and motion information density. Thus, large amounts of video samples are continuously required for traditional data-driven training. However, samples are not always sufficient in real-world scenarios, promoting few-shot action recognition (FSAR) research. We observe that most recent FSAR works build spatio-temporal relation of video samples via temporal alignment after spatial feature extraction, cutting apart spatial and temporal features within samples. They also capture motion information via narrow perspectives between adjacent frames without considering density, leading to insufficient motion information capturing. Therefore, we propose a novel plug-and-play architecture for FSAR called Spatio-tempOral frAme tuPle enhancer (SOAP) in this paper. The model we designed with such architecture refers to SOAP-Net. Temporal connections between different feature channels and spatio-temporal relation of features are considered instead of simple feature extraction. Comprehensive motion information is also captured, using frame tuples with multiple frames containing more motion information than adjacent frames. Combining frame tuples of diverse frame counts further provides a broader perspective. SOAP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance across well-known benchmarks such as SthSthV2, Kinetics, UCF101, and HMDB51. Extensive empirical evaluations underscore the competitiveness, pluggability, generalization, and robustness of SOAP.

The color, shape, and location of moire patterns may differ across video frames, posing a challenge in learning information from adjacent frames and preserving temporal consistency. Previous video demoireing methods heavily rely on well-designed alignment modules, resulting in substantial computational burdens. Recently, Mamba, an improved version of the State Space Model (SSM), has demonstrated significant potential for modeling long-range dependencies with linear complexity, enabling efficient temporal modeling in video demoireing without requiring a specific alignment module. In this paper, we propose a novel alignment-free Raw video demoireing network with frequency-assisted spatio-temporal Mamba (DemMamba). The Spatial Mamba Block (SMB) and Temporal Mamba Block (TMB) are sequentially arranged to facilitate effective intra- and inter-relationship modeling in Raw videos with moire patterns. Within SMB, an Adaptive Frequency Block (AFB) is introduced to aid demoireing in the frequency domain. For TMB, a Channel Attention Block (CAB) is embedded to further enhance temporal information interactions by exploiting the inter-channel relationships among features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DemMamba surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by 1.3 dB and delivers a superior visual experience.</p></details> |  |

Hence, knowledge obtained from Wi-Fi network measurements can be helpful for a more efficient network management. In this paper, we propose a methodology to predict future values of some specific network metrics (e.g. traffic load, transmission failures, etc.). These predictions may be useful for improving the network performance. After data collection and preprocessing, the correlation between each target access point (AP) and its neighbouring APs is estimated. According to these correlations, either an only-temporal or a spatio-temporal based prediction is done. To evaluate the proposed methodology, real measurements are collected from 100 APs deployed in different university buildings for 3 months. Deep Learning (DL) methods (i.e. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Simple Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Transformer) are evaluated and compared for both temporal and spatio-temporal based predictions. Moreover, a hybrid prediction methodology is proposed using a spatial processing based on CNN and a temporal prediction based on RNN. The proposed hybrid methodology provides an improvement in the prediction accuracy at expenses of a slight increase in the Training Computational Time (TCT) and negligible in Prediction Computational Time (PCT).</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Temporal Reversed Training for Spiking Neural Networks with Generalized Spatio-Temporal Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09108v1)** | 2024-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have received widespread attention as an ultra-low energy computing paradigm. Recent studies have focused on improving the feature extraction capability of SNNs, but they suffer from inefficient inference and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective temporal reversed training (TRT) method to optimize the spatio-temporal performance of SNNs and circumvent these problems. We perturb the input temporal data by temporal reversal, prompting the SNN to produce original-reversed consistent output logits and to learn perturbation-invariant representations. For static data without temporal dimension, we generalize this strategy by exploiting the inherent temporal property of spiking neurons for spike feature temporal reversal. In addition, we utilize the lightweight ``star operation" (element-wise multiplication) to hybridize the original and temporally reversed spike firing rates and expand the implicit dimensions, which serves as spatio-temporal regularization to further enhance the generalization of the SNN. Our method involves only an additional temporal reversal operation and element-wise multiplication during training, thus incurring negligible training overhead and not affecting the inference efficiency at all. Extensive experiments on static/neuromorphic object/action recognition, and 3D point cloud classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. In particular, with only two timesteps, our method achieves 74.77\% and 90.57\% accuracy on ImageNet and ModelNet40, respectively.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

However, existing models often face limitations in generalization, struggling with zero-shot prediction on unseen regions and cities, as well as diminished long-term accuracy. This is primarily due to the inherent challenges in handling the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of traffic data, coupled with the significant distribution shift across time and space. In this work, we aim to unlock new possibilities for building versatile, resilient and adaptive spatio-temporal foundation models for traffic prediction. To achieve this goal, we introduce a novel foundation model, named OpenCity, that can effectively capture and normalize the underlying spatio-temporal patterns from diverse data characteristics, facilitating zero-shot generalization across diverse urban environments. OpenCity integrates the Transformer architecture with graph neural networks to model the complex spatio-temporal dependencies in traffic data. By pre-training OpenCity on large-scale, heterogeneous traffic datasets, we enable the model to learn rich, generalizable representations that can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of traffic forecasting scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OpenCity exhibits exceptional zero-shot predictive performance. Moreover, OpenCity showcases promising scaling laws, suggesting the potential for developing a truly one-for-all traffic prediction solution that can adapt to new urban contexts with minimal overhead.

| **[Quantum One-Time Protection of any Randomized Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03305v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The meteoric rise in power and popularity of machine learning models dependent on valuable training data has reignited a basic tension between the power of running a program locally and the risk of exposing details of that program to the user. At the same time, fundamental properties of quantum states offer new solutions to data and program security that can require strikingly few quantum resources to exploit, and offer advantages outside of mere computational run time. In this work, we demonstrate such a solution with quantum one-time tokens. A quantum one-time token is a quantum state that permits a certain program to be evaluated exactly once. One-time security guarantees, roughly, that the token cannot be used to evaluate the program more than once. We propose a scheme for building quantum one-time tokens for any randomized classical program, which include generative AI models. We prove that the scheme satisfies an interesting definition of one-time security as long as outputs of the classical algorithm have high enough min-entropy, in a black box model. Importantly, the classical program being protected does not need to be implemented coherently on a quantum computer. In fact, the size and complexity of the quantum one-time token is independent of the program being protected, and additional quantum resources serve only to increase the security of the protocol. Due to this flexibility in adjusting the security, we believe that our proposal is parsimonious enough to serve as a promising candidate for a near-term useful demonstration of quantum computing in either the NISQ or early fault tolerant regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[Caging in Time: A Framework for Robust Object Manipulation under Uncertainties and Limited Robot Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16481v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world object manipulation has been commonly challenged by physical uncertainties and perception limitations. Being an effective strategy, while caging configuration-based manipulation frameworks have successfully provided robust solutions, they are not broadly applicable due to their strict requirements on the availability of multiple robots, widely distributed contacts, or specific geometries of the robots or the objects. To this end, this work proposes a novel concept, termed Caging in Time, to allow caging configurations to be formed even if there is just one robot engaged in a task. This novel concept can be explained by an insight that even if a caging configuration is needed to constrain the motion of an object, only a small portion of the cage is actively manipulating at a time. As such, we can switch the configuration of the robot strategically so that by collapsing its configuration in time, we will see a cage formed and its necessary portion active whenever needed. We instantiate our Caging in Time theory on challenging quasistatic and dynamic manipulation tasks, showing that Caging in Time can be achieved in general state spaces including geometry-based and energy-based spaces. With extensive experiments, we show robust and accurate manipulation, in an open-loop manner, without requiring detailed knowledge of the object geometry or physical properties, nor realtime accurate feedback on the manipulation states. In addition to being an effective and robust open-loop manipulation solution, the proposed theory can be a supplementary strategy to other manipulation systems affected by uncertain or limited robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 25 figures, video available at: www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ag_jTzazuSM</p></details> |

Lastly, the package directly implements boundary handling methods that enable the methods to be performed on data of arbitrary length, not just dyadic length as is common for wavelet-based methods, ensuring no pre-processing of data is necessary. The key functionality of the package is demonstrated through two data examples, arising from biology and activity monitoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Framework for Real-Time Volcano-Seismic Event Recognition Based on Multi-Station Seismograms and Semantic Segmentation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20595v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In volcano monitoring, effective recognition of seismic events is essential for understanding volcanic activity and raising timely warning alerts. Traditional methods rely on manual analysis, which can be subjective and labor-intensive. Furthermore, current automatic approaches often tackle detection and classification separately, mostly rely on single station information and generally require tailored preprocessing and representations to perform predictions. These limitations often hinder their application to real-time monitoring and utilization across different volcano conditions. This study introduces a novel approach that utilizes Semantic Segmentation models to automate seismic event recognition by applying a straight forward transformation of multi-channel 1D signals into 2D representations, enabling their use as images. Our framework employs a data-driven, end-to-end design that integrates multi-station seismic data with minimal preprocessing, performing both detection and classification simultaneously for five seismic event classes. We evaluated four state-of-the-art segmentation models (UNet, UNet++, DeepLabV3+ and SwinUNet) on approximately 25.000 seismic events recorded at four different Chilean volcanoes: Nevados del Chill\'an Volcanic Complex, Laguna del Maule, Villarrica and Puyehue-Cord\'on Caulle. Among these models, the UNet architecture was identified as the most effective model, achieving mean F1 and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of up to 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, and demonstrating superior noise robustness and model flexibility to unseen volcano datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Fully Dynamic $k$-Median with Near-Optimal Update Time and Recourse](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03121v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In metric $k$-clustering, we are given as input a set of $n$ points in a general metric space, and we have to pick $k$ centers and cluster the input points around these chosen centers, so as to minimize an appropriate objective function. In recent years, significant effort has been devoted to the study of metric $k$-clustering problems in a dynamic setting, where the input keeps changing via updates (point insertions/deletions), and we have to maintain a good clustering throughout these updates. The performance of such a dynamic algorithm is measured in terms of three parameters: (i) Approximation ratio, which signifies the quality of the maintained solution, (ii) Recourse, which signifies how stable the maintained solution is, and (iii) Update time, which signifies the efficiency of the algorithm. We consider the metric $k$-median problem, where the objective is the sum of the distances of the points to their nearest centers. We design the first dynamic algorithm for this problem with near-optimal guarantees across all three performance measures (up to a constant factor in approximation ratio, and polylogarithmic factors in recourse and update time). Specifically, we obtain a $O(1)$-approximation algorithm for dynamic metric $k$-median with $\tilde{O}(1)$ recourse and $\tilde{O}(k)$ update time. Prior to our work, the state-of-the-art here was the recent result of [Bhattacharya et al., FOCS'24], who obtained $O(\epsilon^{-1})$-approximation ratio with $\tilde{O}(k^{\epsilon})$ recourse and $\tilde{O}(k^{1+\epsilon})$ update time. We achieve our results by carefully synthesizing the concept of robust centers introduced in [Fichtenberger et al., SODA'21] along with the randomized local search subroutine from [Bhattacharya et al., FOCS'24], in addition to several key technical insights of our own.</p></details> |  |

APM can process patches of an image one at a time in any order asymmetrically and still encode semantic-awareness in the net. We demonstrate APM's ability to recognize out-of-distribution images without dataset-specific pre-training, augmentation or any-pretext task. APM offers competitive performance over existing TTT approaches. To perform TTT, APM just distills test sample's representation once. APM possesses a unique property: it can learn using just this single representation and starts predicting semantically-aware features. APM demostrates potential applications beyond test-time-training: APM can scale up to a dataset of 2D images and yield semantic-clusterings in a single forward pass. APM also provides first empirical evidence towards validating GLOM's insight, i.e. input percept is a field. Therefore, APM helps us converge towards an implementation which can do both interpolation and perception on a shared-connectionist hardware. Our code is publicly available at this link: https://rajatmodi62.github.io/apm_project_page/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024 Main Track.

Traditional safety monitoring methods, including wearable sensors and GPS, often fail under obstructive or indoor conditions. This research introduces a novel real-time scream detection and localization system tailored for construction sites, especially in low-resource environments. Integrating Wav2Vec2 and Enhanced ConvNet models for accurate scream detection, coupled with the GCC-PHAT algorithm for robust time delay estimation under reverberant conditions, followed by a gradient descent-based approach to achieve precise position estimation in noisy environments. Our approach combines these concepts to achieve high detection accuracy and rapid localization, thereby minimizing false alarms and optimizing emergency response. Preliminary results demonstrate that the system not only accurately detects distress calls amidst construction noise but also reliably identifies the caller's location. This solution represents a substantial improvement in worker safety, with the potential for widespread application across high-risk occupational environments. The scripts used for training, evaluation of scream detection, position estimation, and integrated framework will be released at: https://github.com/Anmol2059/construction_safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 14 figures, 1 table, submitted to AIRISE conference</p></details> |
| **[Losing momentum in continuous-time stochastic optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03705v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The training of modern machine learning models often consists in solving high-dimensional non-convex optimisation problems that are subject to large-scale data. In this context, momentum-based stochastic optimisation algorithms have become particularly widespread. The stochasticity arises from data subsampling which reduces computational cost. Both, momentum and stochasticity help the algorithm to converge globally. In this work, we propose and analyse a continuous-time model for stochastic gradient descent with momentum. This model is a piecewise-deterministic Markov process that represents the optimiser by an underdamped dynamical system and the data subsampling through a stochastic switching. We investigate longtime limits, the subsampling-to-no-subsampling limit, and the momentum-to-no-momentum limit. We are particularly interested in the case of reducing the momentum over time. Under convexity assumptions, we show convergence of our dynamical system to the global minimiser when reducing momentum over time and letting the subsampling rate go to infinity. We then propose a stable, symplectic discretisation scheme to construct an algorithm from our continuous-time dynamical system. In experiments, we study our scheme in convex and non-convex test problems. Additionally, we train a convolutional neural network in an image classification problem. Our algorithm {attains} competitive results compared to stochastic gradient descent with momentum.</p></details> |  |

Still, the generation, and especially the labeling of motion data for specific activities can be time-consuming and costly. Additionally, many models struggle with limited data, which limits their performance in recognizing complex movement patterns. To address those issues, generating synthetic data can help expand the diversity and variability. In this work, we propose IMUDiffusion, a probabilistic diffusion model specifically designed for multivariate time series generation. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality time series sequences which accurately capture the dynamics of human activities. Moreover, by joining our dataset with synthetic data, we achieve a significant improvement in the performance of our baseline human activity classifier. In some cases, we are able to improve the macro F1-score by almost 30%. IMUDiffusion provides a valuable tool for generating realistic human activity movements and enhance the robustness of models in scenarios with limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time-Causal VAE: Robust Financial Time Series Generator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02947v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We build a time-causal variational autoencoder (TC-VAE) for robust generation of financial time series data. Our approach imposes a causality constraint on the encoder and decoder networks, ensuring a causal transport from the real market time series to the fake generated time series. Specifically, we prove that the TC-VAE loss provides an upper bound on the causal Wasserstein distance between market distributions and generated distributions. Consequently, the TC-VAE loss controls the discrepancy between optimal values of various dynamic stochastic optimization problems under real and generated distributions. To further enhance the model's ability to approximate the latent representation of the real market distribution, we integrate a RealNVP prior into the TC-VAE framework. Finally, extensive numerical experiments show that TC-VAE achieves promising results on both synthetic and real market data. This is done by comparing real and generated distributions according to various statistical distances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the generated data for downstream financial optimization tasks, as well as showcasing that the generated data reproduces stylized facts of real financial market data.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABBA-VSM: Time Series Classification using Symbolic Representation on the Edge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10285v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Edge AI has become more prevalent with applications across various industries, from environmental monitoring to smart city management. Edge AI facilitates the processing of Internet of Things (IoT) data and provides privacy-enabled and latency-sensitive services to application users using Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, e.g., Time Series Classification (TSC). However, existing TSC algorithms require access to full raw data and demand substantial computing resources to train and use them effectively in runtime. This makes them impractical for deployment in resource-constrained Edge environments. To address this, in this paper, we propose an Adaptive Brownian Bridge-based Symbolic Aggregation Vector Space Model (ABBA-VSM). It is a new TSC model designed for classification services on Edge. Here, we first adaptively compress the raw time series into symbolic representations, thus capturing the changing trends of data. Subsequently, we train the classification model directly on these symbols. ABBA-VSM reduces communication data between IoT and Edge devices, as well as computation cycles, in the development of resource-efficient TSC services on Edge. We evaluate our solution with extensive experiments using datasets from the UCR time series classification archive. The results demonstrate that the ABBA-VSM achieves up to 80% compression ratio and 90-100% accuracy for binary classification. Whereas, for non-binary classification, it achieves an average compression ratio of 60% and accuracy ranging from 60-80%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages with references, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Mamba Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02941v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series foundation models have demonstrated strong performance in zero-shot learning, making them well-suited for predicting rapidly evolving patterns in real-world applications where relevant training data are scarce. However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge Enhanced Conditional Imputation for Healthcare Time-series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16713v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Conditional Self-Attention Imputation (CSAI), a novel recurrent neural network architecture designed to address the challenges of complex missing data patterns in multivariate time series derived from hospital electronic health records (EHRs). CSAI extends the current state-of-the-art neural network-based imputation methods by introducing key modifications specifically adapted to EHR data characteristics, namely: a) an attention-based hidden state initialisation technique to capture both long- and short-range temporal dependencies prevalent in EHRs, b) a domain-informed temporal decay mechanism to adjust the imputation process to clinical data recording patterns, and c) a non-uniform masking strategy that models non-random missingness by calibrating weights according to both temporal and cross-sectional data characteristics. Comprehensive evaluation across four EHR benchmark datasets demonstrate CSAI's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art neural architectures in data restoration and downstream predictive tasks. Additionally, CSAI is integrated within PyPOTS, an open-source Python toolbox designed for machine learning tasks on partially observed time series. This work significantly advances the state of neural network imputation applied to EHRs by more closely aligning algorithmic imputation with clinical realities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal bounds for POD approximations of infinite horizon control problems based on time derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10552v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we consider the numerical approximation of infinite horizon problems via the dynamic programming approach. The value function of the problem solves a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation that is approximated by a fully discrete method. It is known that the numerical problem is difficult to handle by the so called curse of dimensionality. To mitigate this issue we apply a reduction of the order by means of a new proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) method based on time derivatives. We carry out the error analysis of the method using recently proved optimal bounds for the fully discrete approximations. Moreover, the use of snapshots based on time derivatives allow us to bound some terms of the error that could not be bounded in a standard POD approach. Some numerical experiments show the good performance of the method in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not All Frequencies Are Created Equal:Towards a Dynamic Fusion of Frequencies in Time-Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12415v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term time series forecasting is a long-standing challenge in various applications. A central issue in time series forecasting is that methods should expressively capture long-term dependency. Furthermore, time series forecasting methods should be flexible when applied to different scenarios. Although Fourier analysis offers an alternative to effectively capture reusable and periodic patterns to achieve long-term forecasting in different scenarios, existing methods often assume high-frequency components represent noise and should be discarded in time series forecasting. However, we conduct a series of motivation experiments and discover that the role of certain frequencies varies depending on the scenarios. In some scenarios, removing high-frequency components from the original time series can improve the forecasting performance, while in others scenarios, removing them is harmful to forecasting performance. Therefore, it is necessary to treat the frequencies differently according to specific scenarios. To achieve this, we first reformulate the time series forecasting problem as learning a transfer function of each frequency in the Fourier domain. Further, we design Frequency Dynamic Fusion (FreDF), which individually predicts each Fourier component, and dynamically fuses the output of different frequencies. Moreover, we provide a novel insight into the generalization ability of time series forecasting and propose the generalization bound of time series forecasting. Then we prove FreDF has a lower bound, indicating that FreDF has better generalization ability. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of FreDF.

| **[Test-Time Dynamic Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02840v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent challenge of image fusion lies in capturing the correlation of multi-source images and comprehensively integrating effective information from different sources. Most existing techniques fail to perform dynamic image fusion while notably lacking theoretical guarantees, leading to potential deployment risks in this field. Is it possible to conduct dynamic image fusion with a clear theoretical justification? In this paper, we give our solution from a generalization perspective. We proceed to reveal the generalized form of image fusion and derive a new test-time dynamic image fusion paradigm. It provably reduces the upper bound of generalization error. Specifically, we decompose the fused image into multiple components corresponding to its source data. The decomposed components represent the effective information from the source data, thus the gap between them reflects the Relative Dominability (RD) of the uni-source data in constructing the fusion image. Theoretically, we prove that the key to reducing generalization error hinges on the negative correlation between the RD-based fusion weight and the uni-source reconstruction loss. Intuitively, RD dynamically highlights the dominant regions of each source and can be naturally converted to the corresponding fusion weight, achieving robust results. Extensive experiments and discussions with in-depth analysis on multiple benchmarks confirm our findings and superiority.

| **[Space-Time Decoupled Information Metasurface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01863v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information metasurface is a type of metasurface device capable of rapidly altering its EM characteristics to generate specific information. Past research presents various strategies for embedding information into ambient EM waves through the superposition of each unit's quantified properties. Despite their capabilities, these approaches alone are insufficient for independently managing the creation of information and the allocation of spatial energy. Here, we propose a general theory of space-time decoupled metasurface (STD-Metasurface) to obtain the completely independent manipulation of information generating and spatial filtering. As proof-of-concept demonstration, we design a single-diode small-signal-modulation based prototype, capable of generating precise arbitrary waveforms while maintaining unaltered beam patterns. We exhibit how the superiority of the STD-Metasurface enhance its practicality and facilitate its application as a reconfigurable backscatter transmitter and an dynamic Doppler-spoofing reflection tag.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: Versatile Missing Data Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data often significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet in practice they are frequently encountered. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Our numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and an application to a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing data, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-Domain Pre-training with Language Models for Transferable Time Series Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12372v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in self-supervised pre-training (SSL) have significantly advanced the field of learning transferable time series representations, which can be very useful in enhancing the downstream task. Despite being effective, most existing works struggle to achieve cross-domain SSL pre-training, missing valuable opportunities to integrate patterns and features from different domains. The main challenge lies in the significant differences in the characteristics of time-series data across different domains, such as variations in the number of channels and temporal resolution scales. To address this challenge, we propose CrossTimeNet, a novel cross-domain SSL learning framework to learn transferable knowledge from various domains to largely benefit the target downstream task. One of the key characteristics of CrossTimeNet is the newly designed time series tokenization module, which could effectively convert the raw time series into a sequence of discrete tokens based on a reconstruction optimization process. Besides, we highlight that predicting a high proportion of corrupted tokens can be very helpful for extracting informative patterns across different domains during SSL pre-training, which has been largely overlooked in past years. Furthermore, unlike previous works, our work treats the pre-training language model (PLM) as the initialization of the encoder network, investigating the feasibility of transferring the knowledge learned by the PLM to the time series area. Through these efforts, the path to cross-domain pre-training of a generic time series model can be effectively paved. We conduct extensive experiments in a real-world scenario across various time series classification domains. The experimental results clearly confirm CrossTimeNet's superior performance.</p></details> |  |

Fully harnessing this information is one of the critical drivers for advancing intelligent transportation. Unlike the general scene, detecting text in transportation has extra demand, such as a fast inference speed, except for high accuracy. Most existing real-time text detection methods are based on the shrink mask, which loses some geometry semantic information and needs complex post-processing. In addition, the previous method usually focuses on correct output, which ignores feature correction and lacks guidance during the intermediate process. To this end, we propose an efficient multi-scene text detector that contains an effective text representation similar mask (SM) and a feature correction module (FCM). Unlike previous methods, the former aims to preserve the geometric information of the instances as much as possible. Its post-progressing saves 50$\%$ of the time, accurately and efficiently reconstructing text contours. The latter encourages false positive features to move away from the positive feature center, optimizing the predictions from the feature level. Some ablation studies demonstrate the efficiency of the SM and the effectiveness of the FCM. Moreover, the deficiency of existing traffic datasets (such as the low-quality annotation or closed source data unavailability) motivated us to collect and annotate a traffic text dataset, which introduces motion blur. In addition, to validate the scene robustness of the SM-Net, we conduct experiments on traffic, industrial, and natural scene datasets. Extensive experiments verify it achieves (SOTA) performance on several benchmarks. The code and dataset are available at: \url{https://github.com/fengmulin/SMNet}.</p></details> |  |
| **[FilterNet: Harnessing Frequency Filters for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01623v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening signal processing for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the filtering process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely FilterNet, built upon our proposed learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods.

We also propose Bayesian estimators for this summary measure as well as the unrestricted win probability. Bayesian estimation is scalable and facilitates seamless handling of censoring mechanisms as compared to related non-parametric pairwise approaches like win ratios. Unlike the log-rank test, these measures effectuate the estimand framework as they reflect a clearly defined population quantity related to the probability of a later event time with the potential restriction that event times exceeding a pre-specified time are deemed equivalent. We compare efficacy with established methods using computer simulation and apply the proposed approach to 304 reconstructed datasets from oncology trials. We show that the proposed approach has more power than the log-rank test in early treatment difference scenarios, and at least as much power as the win ratio in all scenarios considered. We also find that the proposed approach's statistical significance is concordant with the log-rank test for the vast majority of the oncology datasets examined. The proposed approach offers an interpretable, efficient alternative for trials with time-to-event outcomes that aligns with the estimand framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text: 12 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables.

The crucial challenge of long-term MTS forecasting requires adept models capable of capturing both intra- and inter-series dependencies. Recent advancements in deep learning, notably Transformers, have shown promise. However, many prevailing methods either marginalize inter-series dependencies or overlook them entirely. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel series-aware framework, explicitly designed to emphasize the significance of such dependencies. At the heart of this framework lies our specific implementation: the SageFormer. As a Series-aware Graph-enhanced Transformer model, SageFormer proficiently discerns and models the intricate relationships between series using graph structures. Beyond capturing diverse temporal patterns, it also curtails redundant information across series. Notably, the series-aware framework seamlessly integrates with existing Transformer-based models, enriching their ability to comprehend inter-series relationships. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the superior performance of SageFormer against contemporary state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: IEEE Internet of Things Journal ( Volume: 11, Issue: 10, 15 May 2024)</p></details> |

While this approach avoids the need for tractable likelihoods, it often requires a large number of simulations and has been challenging to scale to time-series data. Scientific simulators frequently emulate real-world dynamics through thousands of single-state transitions over time. We propose an SBI framework that can exploit such Markovian simulators by locally identifying parameters consistent with individual state transitions. We then compose these local results to obtain a posterior over parameters that align with the entire time series observation. We focus on applying this approach to neural posterior score estimation but also show how it can be applied, e.g., to neural likelihood (ratio) estimation. We demonstrate that our approach is more simulation-efficient than directly estimating the global posterior on several synthetic benchmark tasks and simulators used in ecology and epidemiology. Finally, we validate scalability and simulation efficiency of our approach by applying it to a high-dimensional Kolmogorov flow simulator with around one million dimensions in the data domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, submitted for a publication</p></details> |

In many applications, the event time cannot be observed exactly, calling for the incorporation of time uncertainty into the modeling of point process data. In this work, we introduce a framework to model time-uncertain point processes possibly on a network. We start by deriving the formulation in the continuous-time setting under a few assumptions motivated by application scenarios. After imposing a time grid, we obtain a discrete-time model that facilitates inference and can be computed by first-order optimization methods such as Gradient Descent or Variation inequality (VI) using batch-based Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The parameter recovery guarantee is proved for VI inference at an $O(1/k)$ convergence rate using $k$ SGD steps. Our framework handles non-stationary processes by modeling the inference kernel as a matrix (or tensor on a network) and it covers the stationary process, such as the classical Hawkes process, as a special case. We experimentally show that the proposed approach outperforms previous General Linear model (GLM) baselines on simulated and real data and reveals meaningful causal relations on a Sepsis-associated Derangements dataset.</p></details> |  |

As an application of our results, we obtain for every fixed $k$ a linear-time algorithm for computing the $k$-edge-connected components of a given graph, solving a long-standing open problem. More generally, we obtain a $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithm for computing a $k$-Gomory-Hu tree of a given graph, which is a structure representing pairwise minimum cuts of size $<k$. Our main technical result, from which the other results follow, is a $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithm for computing a $k$-lean tree decomposition of a given graph. This is a tree decomposition with adhesion size $<k$ that captures the existence of separators of size $<k$ between subsets of its bags. A $k$-lean tree decomposition is also an unbreakable tree decomposition with optimal unbreakability parameters for the adhesion size bound $k$. As further applications, we obtain $k^{O(k^2)} m$ time algorithms for $k$-vertex connectivity and for element connectivity $k$-Gomory-Hu tree. All of our algorithms are deterministic. Our techniques are inspired by the tenth paper of the Graph Minors series of Robertson and Seymour and by Bodlaender's parameterized linear-time algorithm for treewidth.</p></details> | 107 pages |

Machine learning (ML) models for multivariate time series classification have made significant strides and achieved impressive success in a wide range of applications and tasks. The challenge of many state-of-the-art ML models is a lack of transparency and interpretability. In this work, we introduce M-CELS, a counterfactual explanation model designed to enhance interpretability in multidimensional time series classification tasks. Our experimental validation involves comparing M-CELS with leading state-of-the-art baselines, utilizing seven real-world time-series datasets from the UEA repository. The results demonstrate the superior performance of M-CELS in terms of validity, proximity, and sparsity, reinforcing its effectiveness in providing transparent insights into the decisions of machine learning models applied to multivariate time series data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICMLA 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2410.20539</p></details> |

The system contains a network of multi-modal sensor nodes and a central node that collectively provide perception services to mobility platforms. The proposed Hierarchical Clustering Considering the Scanning Pattern and Ground Contacting Feature based Lidar Camera Fusion improve intra-node perception for crowded environment. The system also features delay-aware global perception to synchronize and aggregate data across nodes. To validate our approach, we introduced the Indoor Pedestrian Tracking dataset, compiled from data captured by two indoor sensor nodes. Our experiments, compared to baselines, demonstrate significant improvements in detection accuracy and robustness against delays.

The rate of convergence in probability is almost 1/2 for a multiplicative noise; this relies on moment estimates in various norms for the processes and the scheme. In case of an additive noise, due to the coupling of the equations, provided that the difference on temperature between the top and bottom parts of the torus is not too big compared to the viscosity and thermal diffusivity, a strong polynomial rate of convergence (almost 1/2) is proven in $(L^2(D))^2$ for the velocity and in $L^2(D)$ for the temperature. It depends on exponential moments of the scheme; due to linear terms involving the other quantity in both evolution equations, the proof has to be done simultaneaously for both the velocity and the temperature. These rates in both cases are similar to that obtained for the Navier-Stokes equation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2210.04299</p></details> |

In breakthrough works, Arora [J. ACM 1998] and Mitchell [SICOMP 1999] gave the first polynomial time approximation schemes. The running time of their approximation schemes was improved by Rao and Smith [STOC 1998] to $(1/\varepsilon)^{O(1/\varepsilon)} n \log n$. Bartal and Gottlieb [FOCS 2013] gave an approximation scheme of running time $2^{(1/\varepsilon)^{O(1)}} n$, which is optimal in $n$. Recently, Kisfaludi-Bak, Nederlof, and W\k{e}grzycki [FOCS 2021] gave a $2^{O(1/\varepsilon)} n \log n$ time approximation scheme, achieving the optimal running time in $\varepsilon$ under the Gap-ETH conjecture. In our work, we give a $2^{O(1/\varepsilon)} n$ time approximation scheme, achieving the optimal running time both in $n$ and in $\varepsilon$ under the Gap-ETH conjecture.</p></details> |  |

However, its efficacy is often limited by static training modes and heavy reliance on vast data from stable environments. To address these shortcomings, this study explores integrating dynamic weight adjustments into Deep Q-Networks (DQN) to enhance their adaptability. We implement these adjustments by modifying the sampling probabilities in the experience replay to make the model focus more on pivotal transitions as indicated by real-time environmental feedback and performance metrics. We design a novel Interactive Dynamic Evaluation Method (IDEM) for DQN that successfully navigates dynamic environments by prioritizing significant transitions based on environmental feedback and learning progress. Additionally, when faced with rapid changes in environmental conditions, IDEM-DQN shows improved performance compared to baseline methods. Our results indicate that under circumstances requiring rapid adaptation, IDEM-DQN can more effectively generalize and stabilize learning. Extensive experiments across various settings confirm that IDEM-DQN outperforms standard DQN models, particularly in environments characterized by frequent and unpredictable changes.</p></details> | Accepted by ICKG2024 |

In the past, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such approaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This paper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as velocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process state-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across different domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of continuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and the estimation of quasi-static continuum robot shapes. Results show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors, potentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate estimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which limited sensing is available.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, submitted to Robotica</p></details> |

Vehicle re-identification, by matching the same vehicle at different locations, is helpful in understanding the long-distance journey patterns. In this paper, the potential hazards of ignoring the survivorship bias effects are firstly identified and analyzed using a truncated distribution over a 2-dimensional time-time domain. Given journey time modeled as Exponential or Weibull distribution, Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Fisher Information (F.I.) and Bootstrap methods are formulated to estimate the parameter of interest and their confidence intervals. Besides formulating journey time distributions, an automated framework querying the observable time-time scope are proposed. For complex distributions (e.g, three parameter Weibull), distributions are modeled in PyTorch to automatically find first and second derivatives and estimated results. Three experiments are designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. In conclusion, the paper describes a very unique aspects in understanding and analyzing traffic status. Although the survivorship bias effects are not recognized and long-ignored, by accurately describing travel time over time-time domain, the proposed approach have potentials in travel time reliability analysis, understanding logistics systems, modeling/predicting product lifespans, etc.</p></details> | 22 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Noisy Circuits with Naturally Fault-Tolerant Gates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02535v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the output distribution of low-depth noisy Clifford circuits with any product-state inputs and final single-qubit measurements in any basis. This class of circuits includes Clifford-magic circuits and Conjugated-Clifford circuits, which are important candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage using non-universal gates. Additionally, our results generalize a simulation algorithm for IQP circuits [Rajakumar et. al, SODA'25] to the case of IQP circuits augmented with CNOT gates, which is another class of non-universal circuits that are relevant to current experiments. Importantly, our results do not require randomness assumptions over the circuit families considered (such as anticoncentration properties) and instead hold for \textit{every} circuit in each class. This allows us to place tight limitations on the robustness of these circuits to noise. In particular, we show that there is no quantum advantage at large depths with realistically noisy Clifford circuits, even with perfect magic state inputs, or IQP circuits with CNOT gates, even with arbitrary diagonal non-Clifford gates. The key insight behind the algorithm is that interspersed noise causes a decay of long-range entanglement, and at depths beyond a critical threshold, the noise builds up to an extent that most correlations can be classically simulated. To prove our results, we merge techniques from percolation theory with tools from Pauli path analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Way Functions and Polynomial Time Dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02392v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work solves an open problem regarding the rate of time-bounded Kolmogorov complexity and polynomial-time dimension, conditioned on a hardness assumption. Hitchcock and Vinodchandran (CCC 2004) show that the polynomial-time dimension of infinite sequences (denoted ${\mathrm{cdim}}_\mathrm{P}$) defined using betting algorithms called gales, is lower bounded by the asymptotic lower rate of polynomial-time Kolmogorov complexity (denoted $\mathcal{K}_\text{poly}$). Hitchcock and Vindochandran and Stull asked whether the converse relationship also holds. This question has thus far resisted resolution. The corresponding unbounded notions, namely, the constructive dimension and the asymptotic lower rate of unbounded Kolmogorov complexity are equal for every sequence. Analogous notions are equal even at finite-state level. In view of these results, it is reasonable to conjecture that the polynomial-time quantities are identical for every sequence and set of sequences. However, under a plausible assumption which underlies modern cryptography - namely the existence of one-way functions, we refute the conjecture thereby giving a negative answer to the open question posed by Hitchcock and Vinodchandran and Stull . We show the following, conditioned on the existence of one-way functions: There are sets $\mathcal{F}$ of infinite sequences whose polytime dimension strictly exceeds $\mathcal{K}_\text{poly}(\mathcal{F})$, that is ${\mathrm{cdim}}_\mathrm{P}(\mathcal{F}) > \mathcal{K}_\text{poly}(\mathcal{F})$. We establish a stronger version of this result, that there are individual sequences $X$ whose poly-time dimension strictly exceeds $\mathcal{K}_\text{poly}(X)$, that is ${\mathrm{cdim}}_\mathrm{P}(X) > \mathcal{K}_\text{poly}(X)$. Further, we show that the gap between these quantities can be made arbitrarily close to 1. We also establish similar bounds for strong poly-time dimension</p></details> |  |

| **[Bounding Stochastic Safety: Leveraging Freedman's Inequality with Discrete-Time Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05745v5)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When deployed in the real world, safe control methods must be robust to unstructured uncertainties such as modeling error and external disturbances. Typical robust safety methods achieve their guarantees by always assuming that the worst-case disturbance will occur. In contrast, this paper utilizes Freedman's inequality in the context of discrete-time control barrier functions (DTCBFs) and c-martingales to provide stronger (less conservative) safety guarantees for stochastic systems. Our approach accounts for the underlying disturbance distribution instead of relying exclusively on its worst-case bound and does not require the barrier function to be upper-bounded, which makes the resulting safety probability bounds more directly useful for intuitive safety constraints such as signed distance. We compare our results with existing safety guarantees, such as input-to-state safety (ISSf) and martingale results that rely on Ville's inequality. When the assumptions for all methods hold, we provide a range of parameters for which our guarantee is stronger. Finally, we present simulation examples, including a bipedal walking robot, that demonstrate the utility and tightness of our safety guarantee.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Chronos tokenizes time series values using scaling and quantization into a fixed vocabulary and trains existing transformer-based language model architectures on these tokenized time series via the cross-entropy loss. We pretrained Chronos models based on the T5 family (ranging from 20M to 710M parameters) on a large collection of publicly available datasets, complemented by a synthetic dataset that we generated via Gaussian processes to improve generalization. In a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 42 datasets, and comprising both classical local models and deep learning methods, we show that Chronos models: (a) significantly outperform other methods on datasets that were part of the training corpus; and (b) have comparable and occasionally superior zero-shot performance on new datasets, relative to methods that were trained specifically on them. Our results demonstrate that Chronos models can leverage time series data from diverse domains to improve zero-shot accuracy on unseen forecasting tasks, positioning pretrained models as a viable tool to greatly simplify forecasting pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and model checkpoints available at https://github.com/amazon-science/chronos-forecasting</p></details> |

The proposed fully discrete method combines an IMEX-L1 method on a graded mesh in the temporal variable with a mixed finite element method in spatial variables. The focus of the study is to analyze stability results and to establish optimal error estimates, up to a logarithmic factor, for both the solution and the flux in $L^2$-norm when the initial data $u_0\in H_0^1(\Omega)\cap H^2(\Omega)$. Additionally, an error estimate in $L^\infty$-norm is derived for 2D problems. All the derived estimates and bounds in this article remain valid as $\alpha\to 1^{-}$, where $\alpha$ is the order of the Caputo fractional derivative. Finally, the results of several numerical experiments conducted at the end of this paper are confirming our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constant congestion linkages in polynomially strong digraphs in polynomial time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03873v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given integers $k,c > 0$, we say that a digraph $D$ is $(k,c)$-linked if for every pair of ordered sets $\{s_1, \ldots, s_k\}$ and $\{t_1, \ldots, t_k\}$ of vertices of $D$, there are $P_1, \ldots, P_k$ such that for $i \in [k]$ each $P_i$ is a path from $s_i$ to $t_i$ and every vertex of $D$ appears in at most $c$ of those paths. Thomassen [Combinatorica, 1991] showed that for every fixed $k \geq 2$ there is no integer $p$ such that every $p$-strong digraph is $(k,1)$-linked. Edwards et al. [ESA, 2017] showed that every digraph $D$ with directed treewidth at least some function $f(k)$ contains a large bramble of congestion $2$ and that every $(36k^3 + 2k)$-strong digraph containing a bramble of congestion $2$ and size roughly $188k^3$ is $(k,2)$-linked. Since the directed treewidth of a digraph has to be at least its strong connectivity, this implies that there is a function $L(k)$ such that every $L(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,2)$-linked. This result was improved by Campos et al. [ESA, 2023], who showed that any $k$-strong digraph containing a bramble of size at least $2k(c\cdot k -c + 2) + c(k-1)$ and congestion $c$ is $(k,c)$-linked. Regarding the bramble, although the given bound on $f(k)$ is very large, Masa\v{r}\'ik et al. [SIDMA, 2022] showed that directed treewidth $\mathcal{O}(k^{48}\log^{13} k)$ suffices if the congestion is relaxed to $8$. We first show how to drop the dependence on $c$, for even $c$, on the size of the bramble that is needed in the work of Campos et al. [ESA, 2023]. Then, by making two local changes in the proof of Masa\v{r}\'ik et al. [SIDMA, 2022] we show how to build in polynomial time a bramble of size $k$ and congestion $8$ assuming that a large obstruction to directed treewidth (namely, a path system) is given. Applying these results, we show that there is a polynomial function $g(k)$ such that every $g(k)$-strong digraph is $(k,8)$-linked.</p></details> |  |

Such bugs have been pronounced in the Linux kernel. The paper focuses on regression bug tracking in the kernel by considering the time required to fix regression bugs. The dataset examined is based on the regzbot automation framework for tracking regressions in the Linux kernel. According to the results, (i) regression bug fixing times have been faster than previously reported; between 2021 and 2024, on average, it has taken less than a month to fix regression bugs. It is further evident that (ii) device drivers constitute the most prone subsystem for regression bugs, and also the fixing times vary across the kernel's subsystems. Although (iii) most commits fixing regression bugs have been reviewed, tested, or both, the kernel's code reviewing and manual testing practices do not explain the fixing times. Likewise, (iv) there is only a weak signal that code churn might contribute to explaining the fixing times statistically. Finally, (v) some subsystems exhibit strong effects for explaining the bug fixing times statistically, although overall statistical performance is modest but not atypical to the research domain. With these empirical results, the paper contributes to the efforts to better understand software regressions and their tracking in the Linux kernel.</p></details> | Submitted |

For safety assurance applications, especially in early-warning scenarios, RTM faults are expected to be detected as early as possible on a continuous 7x24 basis. However, limited emphasis has been placed on distributed model inference frameworks that can meet the inference latency and reliability requirements of such mission critical fault diagnosis systems. In this paper, an edge-cloud collaborative early-warning system is proposed to enable real-time and downtime-tolerant fault diagnosis of RTMs, providing a new paradigm for the deployment of models in safety-critical scenarios. Firstly, a modular fault diagnosis model is designed specifically for distributed deployment, which utilizes a hierarchical architecture consisting of the prior knowledge module, subordinate classifiers, and a fusion layer for enhanced accuracy and parallelism. Then, a cloud-edge collaborative framework leveraging pipeline parallelism, namely CEC-PA, is developed to minimize the overhead resulting from distributed task execution and context exchange by strategically partitioning and offloading model components across cloud and edge. Additionally, an election consensus mechanism is implemented within CEC-PA to ensure system robustness during coordinator node downtime. Comparative experiments and ablation studies are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed fault diagnosis approach. Our ensemble-based fault diagnosis model achieves a remarkable 97.4% accuracy on a real-world dataset collected by Nanjing Metro in Jiangsu Province, China. Meanwhile, CEC-PA demonstrates superior recovery proficiency during node disruptions and speed-up ranging from 1.98x to 7.93x in total inference time compared to its counterparts.</p></details> |  |

Using transparency and multimedia, data journalism (DJ) lets users explore and interpret data on their own. This study examines how DJ affects online comments as a case study of user interactions with data. The corpus comprises 6,400 stories and their comment sections from the DJ and other sections of the New York Times, from 2014-2022. Results indicate that DJ is positively associated with higher level of interactivity between the users. This relationship is mediated by statistical information, information sources, and static visualizations. However, there is a low level of interactivity with the content; consequently, only part of the users use it. The results demonstrate how data accessibility through DJ engages the users in conversation. According to deliberation theory, this creates a conducive environment for democratic processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Hawai...</summary><p>Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences (HICSS)</p></details> |

We introduce a granular nowcasting method for macro- and industry-level GDP using a network approach and data on real-time monthly inter-industry payments in the UK. To this purpose we devise a model which we call an extended generalised network autoregressive (GNAR-ex) model, tailored for networks with time-varying edge weights and nodal time series, that exploits the notion of neighbouring nodes and neighbouring edges. The performance of the model is illustrated on a range of synthetic data experiments. We implement the GNAR-ex model on the payments network including time series information of GDP and payment amounts. To obtain robustness against statistical revisions, we optimise the model over 9 quarterly releases of GDP data from the UK Office for National Statistics. Our GNAR-ex model can outperform baseline autoregressive benchmark models, leading to a reduced forecasting error. This work helps to obtain timely GDP estimates at the aggregate and industry level derived from alternative data sources compared to existing, mostly survey-based, methods. Thus, this paper contributes both, a novel model for networks with nodal time series and time-varying edge weights, and the first network-based approach for GDP nowcasting based on payments data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonconvex High-Dimensional Time-Varying Coefficient Estimation for Noisy High-Frequency Observations with a Factor Structure](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02694v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel high-dimensional time-varying coefficient estimator for noisy high-frequency observations with a factor structure. In high-frequency finance, we often observe that noises dominate the signal of underlying true processes and that covariates exhibit a factor structure due to their strong dependence. Thus, we cannot apply usual regression procedures to analyze high-frequency observations. To handle the noises, we first employ a smoothing method for the observed dependent and covariate processes. Then, to handle the strong dependence of the covariate processes, we apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and transform the highly correlated covariate structure into a weakly correlated structure. However, the variables from PCA still contain non-negligible noises. To manage these non-negligible noises and the high dimensionality, we propose a nonconvex penalized regression method for each local coefficient. This method produces consistent but biased local coefficient estimators. To estimate the integrated coefficients, we propose a debiasing scheme and obtain a debiased integrated coefficient estimator using debiased local coefficient estimators. Then, to further account for the sparsity structure of the coefficients, we apply a thresholding scheme to the debiased integrated coefficient estimator. We call this scheme the Factor Adjusted Thresholded dEbiased Nonconvex LASSO (FATEN-LASSO) estimator. Furthermore, this paper establishes the concentration properties of the FATEN-LASSO estimator and discusses a nonconvex optimization algorithm.</p></details> | 94 pages, 6 figures |

Anomalies in web service data, for example, can signal critical incidents such as system failures or server malfunctions, necessitating timely detection and response. However, most existing TSAD methodologies rely heavily on manual feature engineering or require extensive labeled training data, while also offering limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering framework called the Time Series Anomaly Multimodal Analyzer (TAMA), which leverages the power of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance both the detection and interpretation of anomalies in time series data. By converting time series into visual formats that LMMs can efficiently process, TAMA leverages few-shot in-context learning capabilities to reduce dependence on extensive labeled datasets. Our methodology is validated through rigorous experimentation on multiple real-world datasets, where TAMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in TSAD tasks. Additionally, TAMA provides rich, natural language-based semantic analysis, offering deeper insights into the nature of detected anomalies. Furthermore, we contribute one of the first open-source datasets that includes anomaly detection labels, anomaly type labels, and contextual description, facilitating broader exploration and advancement within this critical field. Ultimately, TAMA not only excels in anomaly detection but also provides a comprehensive approach for understanding the underlying causes of anomalies, pushing TSAD forward through innovative methodologies and insights.</p></details> | Under review |

This requires precise frame transmission planning, which becomes especially hard when dealing with many streams, large networks, and dynamically changing communications. A very promising approach uses conflict graphs, modeling conflicting transmission configurations. Since the creation of conflict graphs is the bottleneck in these approaches, we provide an improvement to the conflict graph creation. We present a randomized selection process that reduces the overall size of the graph in half and three heuristics to improve the scheduling success. In our evaluations we show substantial improvements in the graph creation speed and the scheduling success compared to existing work, updating existing schedules in fractions of a second. Additionally, offline planning of 9000 streams was performed successfully within minutes.</p></details> |  |

Several location statistics have been proposed, which reduce to the ordinary mean in Euclidean space. A relatively new family of contenders in this field are Diffusion Means, which are a one parameter family of location statistics modeled as initial points of isotropic diffusion with the diffusion time as parameter. It is natural to consider limit cases of the diffusion time parameter and it turns out that for short times the diffusion mean set approaches the intrinsic mean set. For long diffusion times, the limit is less obvious but for spheres of arbitrary dimension the diffusion mean set has been shown to converge to the extrinsic mean set. Here, we extend this result to the real projective spaces in their unique smooth isometric embedding into a linear space. We conjecture that the long time limit is always given by the extrinsic mean in the isometric embedding for connected compact symmetric spaces with unique isometric embedding.</p></details> | 21 pages, no figures |

The key advantage of the estimator lies in its capability to facilitate security control in a wide range of practical scenarios, even when the attacker's information is previously unknown. We demonstrate the advantage and application of our new estimator in the context of two classical control scenarios, namely consensus of multi-agent systems and impulsive stabilization of nonlinear systems, for illustration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum One-Time Programs, Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01876v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, CRYPTO 2008) are functions that can be run on any single input of a user's choice, but not on a second input. Classically, they are unachievable without trusted hardware, but the destructive nature of quantum measurements seems to provide a quantum path to constructing them. Unfortunately, Broadbent, Gutoski and Stebila showed that even with quantum techniques, a strong notion of one-time programs, similar to ideal obfuscation, cannot be achieved for any non-trivial quantum function. On the positive side, Ben-David and Sattath (Quantum, 2023) showed how to construct a one-time program for a certain (probabilistic) digital signature scheme, under a weaker notion of one-time program security. There is a vast gap between achievable and provably impossible notions of one-time program security, and it is unclear what functionalities are one-time programmable under the achievable notions of security. In this work, we present new, meaningful, yet achievable definitions of one-time program security for probabilistic classical functions. We show how to construct one time programs satisfying these definitions for all functions in the classical oracle model and for constrained pseudorandom functions in the plain model. Finally, we examine the limits of these notions: we show a class of functions which cannot be one-time programmed in the plain model, as well as a class of functions which appears to be highly random given a single query, but whose one-time program form leaks the entire function even in the oracle model.</p></details> |  |
| **[ElasTST: Towards Robust Varied-Horizon Forecasting with Elastic Time-Series Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01842v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous industrial sectors necessitate models capable of providing robust forecasts across various horizons. Despite the recent strides in crafting specific architectures for time-series forecasting and developing pre-trained universal models, a comprehensive examination of their capability in accommodating varied-horizon forecasting during inference is still lacking. This paper bridges this gap through the design and evaluation of the Elastic Time-Series Transformer (ElasTST). The ElasTST model incorporates a non-autoregressive design with placeholders and structured self-attention masks, warranting future outputs that are invariant to adjustments in inference horizons. A tunable version of rotary position embedding is also integrated into ElasTST to capture time-series-specific periods and enhance adaptability to different horizons. Additionally, ElasTST employs a multi-scale patch design, effectively integrating both fine-grained and coarse-grained information. During the training phase, ElasTST uses a horizon reweighting strategy that approximates the effect of random sampling across multiple horizons with a single fixed horizon setting. Through comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art time-series architectures and contemporary foundation models, we demonstrate the efficacy of ElasTST's unique design elements. Our findings position ElasTST as a robust solution for the practical necessity of varied-horizon forecasting.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[A Polynomial-Time Algorithm for Fair and Efficient Allocation with a Fixed Number of Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01810v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of fairly and efficiently allocating indivisible goods among agents with additive valuation functions. Envy-freeness up to one good (EF1) is a well-studied fairness notion for indivisible goods, while Pareto optimality (PO) and its stronger variant, fractional Pareto optimality (fPO), are widely recognized efficiency criteria. Although each property is straightforward to achieve individually, simultaneously ensuring both fairness and efficiency is challenging. Caragiannis et al.~\cite{caragiannis2019unreasonable} established the surprising result that maximizing Nash social welfare yields an allocation that is both EF1 and PO; however, since maximizing Nash social welfare is NP-hard, this approach does not provide an efficient algorithm. To overcome this barrier, Barman, Krishnamurthy, and Vaish~\cite{barman2018finding} designed a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm to compute an EF1 and PO allocation, and showed the existence of EF1 and fPO allocations. Nevertheless, the latter existence proof relies on a non-constructive convergence argument and does not directly yield an efficient algorithm for finding EF1 and fPO allocations. Whether a polynomial-time algorithm exists for finding an EF1 and PO (or fPO) allocation remains an important open problem. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to compute an allocation that achieves both EF1 and fPO under additive valuation functions when the number of agents is fixed. Our primary idea is to avoid processing the entire instance at once; instead, we sequentially add agents to the instance and construct an allocation that satisfies EF1 and fPO at each step.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing the Loose Brake: Exponential-Tailed Stopping Time in Best Arm Identification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01808v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The best arm identification problem requires identifying the best alternative (i.e., arm) in active experimentation using the smallest number of experiments (i.e., arm pulls), which is crucial for cost-efficient and timely decision-making processes. In the fixed confidence setting, an algorithm must stop data-dependently and return the estimated best arm with a correctness guarantee. Since this stopping time is random, we desire its distribution to have light tails. Unfortunately, many existing studies focus on high probability or in expectation bounds on the stopping time, which allow heavy tails and, for high probability bounds, even not stopping at all. We first prove that this never-stopping event can indeed happen for some popular algorithms. Motivated by this, we propose algorithms that provably enjoy an exponential-tailed stopping time, which improves upon the polynomial tail bound reported by Kalyanakrishnan et al. (2012). The first algorithm is based on a fixed budget algorithm called Sequential Halving along with a doubling trick. The second algorithm is a meta algorithm that takes in any fixed confidence algorithm with a high probability stopping guarantee and turns it into one that enjoys an exponential-tailed stopping time. Our results imply that there is much more to be desired for contemporary fixed confidence algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discrete-state Continuous-time Diffusion for Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11416v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph is a prevalent discrete data structure, whose generation has wide applications such as drug discovery and circuit design. Diffusion generative models, as an emerging research focus, have been applied to graph generation tasks. Overall, according to the space of states and time steps, diffusion generative models can be categorized into discrete-/continuous-state discrete-/continuous-time fashions. In this paper, we formulate the graph diffusion generation in a discrete-state continuous-time setting, which has never been studied in previous graph diffusion models. The rationale of such a formulation is to preserve the discrete nature of graph-structured data and meanwhile provide flexible sampling trade-offs between sample quality and efficiency. Analysis shows that our training objective is closely related to generation quality, and our proposed generation framework enjoys ideal invariant/equivariant properties concerning the permutation of node ordering. Our proposed model shows competitive empirical performance against state-of-the-art graph generation solutions on various benchmarks and, at the same time, can flexibly trade off the generation quality and efficiency in the sampling phase.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperVINS: A Real-Time Visual-Inertial SLAM Framework for Challenging Imaging Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21348v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional visual-inertial SLAM system often struggles with stability under low-light or motion-blur conditions, leading to potential lost of trajectory tracking. High accuracy and robustness are essential for the long-term and stable localization capabilities of SLAM systems. Addressing the challenges of enhancing robustness and accuracy in visual-inertial SLAM, this paper propose SuperVINS, a real-time visual-inertial SLAM framework designed for challenging imaging conditions. In contrast to geometric modeling, deep learning features are capable of fully leveraging the implicit information present in images, which is often not captured by geometric features. Therefore, SuperVINS, developed as an enhancement of VINS-Fusion, integrates the deep learning neural network model SuperPoint for feature point extraction and loop closure detection. At the same time, a deep learning neural network LightGlue model for associating feature points is integrated in front-end feature matching. A feature matching enhancement strategy based on the RANSAC algorithm is proposed. The system is allowed to set different masks and RANSAC thresholds for various environments, thereby balancing computational cost and localization accuracy. Additionally, it allows for flexible training of specific SuperPoint bag of words tailored for loop closure detection in particular environments. The system enables real-time localization and mapping. Experimental validation on the well-known EuRoC dataset demonstrates that SuperVINS is comparable to other visual-inertial SLAM system in accuracy and robustness across the most challenging sequences. This paper analyzes the advantages of SuperVINS in terms of accuracy, real-time performance, and robustness. To facilitate knowledge exchange within the field, we have made the code for this paper publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Graph Learning via Time-Vertex Adaptive Filters: From Theory to Cardiac Fibrillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01567v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Signal Processing (GSP) provides a powerful framework for analysing complex, interconnected systems by modelling data as signals on graphs. Recent advances in GSP have enabled the learning of graph structures from observed signals, but these methods often struggle with time-varying systems and real-time applications. Adaptive filtering techniques, while effective for online learning, have seen limited application in graph topology estimation from a GSP perspective. To this end, we introduce AdaCGP, an online algorithm for adaptive estimation of the Graph Shift Operator (GSO) from multivariate time series. The GSO is estimated from an adaptive time-vertex autoregressive model through recursive update formulae designed to address sparsity, shift-invariance and bias. Through simulations, we show that AdaCGP performs consistently well across various graph topologies, and achieves improvements in excess of 82% for GSO estimation compared to baseline adaptive vector autoregressive models. In addition, our online variable splitting approach for enforcing sparsity enables near-perfect precision in identifying causal connections while maintaining low false positive rates upon optimisation of the forecast error. Finally, AdaCGP's ability to track changes in graph structure is demonstrated on recordings of ventricular fibrillation dynamics in response to an anti-arrhythmic drug. AdaCGP is shown to be able to identify the stability of critical conduction patterns that may be maintaining the arrhythmia in an intuitive way, together with its potential to support diagnosis and treatment strategies.</p></details> |  |

Recently, we have proved the existence of the maximal solution to the CDARE with a nonsingular control weighting matrix under the framework of the constructive method. Our contribution in the work is to finding another meaningful Hermitian solutions, which has received little attention in this topic. Moreover, we show that some extremal solutions cannot be attained at the same time, and almost (anti-)stabilizing solutions coincide with some extremal solutions. It is to be expected that our theoretical results presented in this paper will play an important role in the optimal control problems for discrete-time antilinear systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Forecasts Using Real-Time Data Flow and Hierarchical Forecast Reconciliation, with Applications to the Energy Sector](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01528v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel framework for hierarchical forecast updating is presented, addressing a critical gap in the forecasting literature. By assuming a temporal hierarchy structure, the innovative approach extends hierarchical forecast reconciliation to effectively manage the challenge posed by partially observed data. This crucial extension allows, in conjunction with real-time data, to obtain updated and coherent forecasts across the entire temporal hierarchy, thereby enhancing decision-making accuracy. The framework involves updating base models in response to new data, which produces revised base forecasts. A subsequent pruning step integrates the newly available data, allowing for the application of any forecast reconciliation method to obtain fully updated reconciled forecasts. Additionally, the framework not only ensures coherence among forecasts but also improves overall accuracy throughout the hierarchy. Its inherent flexibility and interpretability enable users to perform hierarchical forecast updating concisely. The methodology is extensively demonstrated in a simulation study with various settings and comparing different data-generating processes, hierarchies, and reconciliation methods. Practical applicability is illustrated through two case studies in the energy sector, energy generation and solar power data, where the framework yields superior results compared to base models that do not incorporate new data, leading to more precise decision-making outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Transformation Model for Time-to-Event Data Affected by Unobserved Confounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15968v3)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by studies investigating causal effects in survival analysis, we propose a transformation model to quantify the impact of a binary treatment on a time-to-event outcome. The approach is based on a flexible linear transformation structural model that links a monotone function of the time-to-event with the propensity for treatment through a bivariate Gaussian distribution. The model equations are specified as functions of additive predictors, allowing the impacts of observed confounders to be accounted for flexibly. Furthermore, the effect of the instrumental variable may be regularized through a ridge penalty, while interactions between the treatment and modifier variables can be incorporated into the model to acknowledge potential variations in treatment effects across different subgroups. The baseline survival function is estimated in a flexible manner using monotonic P-splines, while unobserved confounding is captured through the dependence parameter of the bivariate Gaussian. The proposal naturally provides an intuitive causal measure of interest, the survival average treatment effect. Parameter estimation is achieved via a computationally efficient and stable penalized maximum likelihood estimation approach and intervals constructed using the related inferential results. We revisit a dataset from the Illinois Reemployment Bonus Experiment to estimate the causal effect of a cash bonus on unemployment duration, unveiling new insights. The modeling framework is incorporated into the R package GJRM, enabling researchers and practitioners to fit the proposed causal survival model and obtain easy-to-interpret numerical and visual summaries.</p></details> |  |

| **[Temporal Smoothness Regularisers for Neural Link Predictors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09045v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most algorithms for representation learning and link prediction on relational data are designed for static data. However, the data to which they are applied typically evolves over time, including online social networks or interactions between users and items in recommender systems. This is also the case for graph-structured knowledge bases -- knowledge graphs -- which contain facts that are valid only for specific points in time. In such contexts, it becomes crucial to correctly identify missing links at a precise time point, i.e. the temporal prediction link task. Recently, Lacroix et al. and Sadeghian et al. proposed a solution to the problem of link prediction for knowledge graphs under temporal constraints inspired by the canonical decomposition of 4-order tensors, where they regularise the representations of time steps by enforcing temporal smoothing, i.e. by learning similar transformation for adjacent timestamps. However, the impact of the choice of temporal regularisation terms is still poorly understood. In this work, we systematically analyse several choices of temporal smoothing regularisers using linear functions and recurrent architectures. In our experiments, we show that by carefully selecting the temporal smoothing regulariser and regularisation weight, a simple method like TNTComplEx can produce significantly more accurate results than state-of-the-art methods on three widely used temporal link prediction datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of a wide range of temporal smoothing regularisers on two state-of-the-art temporal link prediction models. Our work shows that simple tensor factorisation models can produce new state-of-the-art results using newly proposed temporal regularisers, highlighting a promising avenue for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative AI Enables EEG Super-Resolution via Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03089v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG) devices, are widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, which meet the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus localization. However, this technique faces challenges, such as high acquisition costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive diffusion models (STAD) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal features of LR EEG, which then used as conditional inputs to direct the reverse denoising process. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the STAD significantly enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STAD demonstrate their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source localization tasks, indicating their potential to Substantially boost the spatial resolution of EEG.</p></details> |  |
| **[CRT-Fusion: Camera, Radar, Temporal Fusion Using Motion Information for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03013v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and robust 3D object detection is a critical component in autonomous vehicles and robotics. While recent radar-camera fusion methods have made significant progress by fusing information in the bird's-eye view (BEV) representation, they often struggle to effectively capture the motion of dynamic objects, leading to limited performance in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CRT-Fusion, a novel framework that integrates temporal information into radar-camera fusion to address this challenge. Our approach comprises three key modules: Multi-View Fusion (MVF), Motion Feature Estimator (MFE), and Motion Guided Temporal Fusion (MGTF). The MVF module fuses radar and image features within both the camera view and bird's-eye view, thereby generating a more precise unified BEV representation. The MFE module conducts two simultaneous tasks: estimation of pixel-wise velocity information and BEV segmentation. Based on the velocity and the occupancy score map obtained from the MFE module, the MGTF module aligns and fuses feature maps across multiple timestamps in a recurrent manner. By considering the motion of dynamic objects, CRT-Fusion can produce robust BEV feature maps, thereby improving detection accuracy and robustness. Extensive evaluations on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CRT-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance for radar-camera-based 3D object detection. Our approach outperforms the previous best method in terms of NDS by +1.7%, while also surpassing the leading approach in mAP by +1.4%. These significant improvements in both metrics showcase the effectiveness of our proposed fusion strategy in enhancing the reliability and accuracy of 3D object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we explore the concept of equilibrium design, where incentives are designed to obtain a desirable equilibrium that satisfies a specific temporal logic property. Our study is based on a framework where system specifications are represented as temporal logic formulae, games as quantitative concurrent game structures, and players' goals as mean-payoff objectives. We consider system specifications given by LTL and GR(1) formulae, and show that designing incentives to ensure that a given temporal logic property is satisfied on some/every Nash equilibrium of the game can be achieved in PSPACE for LTL properties and in NP/{\Sigma}P 2 for GR(1) specifications. We also examine the complexity of related decision and optimisation problems, such as optimality and uniqueness of solutions, as well as considering social welfare, and show that the complexities of these problems lie within the polynomial hierarchy. Equilibrium design can be used as an alternative solution to rational synthesis and verification problems for concurrent games with mean-payoff objectives when no solution exists or as a technique to repair concurrent games with undesirable Nash equilibria in an optimal way.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript is going to be submitted to the Journal on Logical Methods in Computer Science. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2106.10192</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Wasserstein Imputation: Versatile Missing Data Imputation for Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02811v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Missing data often significantly hamper standard time series analysis, yet in practice they are frequently encountered. In this paper, we introduce temporal Wasserstein imputation, a novel method for imputing missing data in time series. Unlike existing techniques, our approach is fully nonparametric, circumventing the need for model specification prior to imputation, making it suitable for potential nonlinear dynamics. Its principled algorithmic implementation can seamlessly handle univariate or multivariate time series with any missing pattern. In addition, the plausible range and side information of the missing entries (such as box constraints) can easily be incorporated. As a key advantage, our method mitigates the distributional bias typical of many existing approaches, ensuring more reliable downstream statistical analysis using the imputed series. Leveraging the benign landscape of the optimization formulation, we establish the convergence of an alternating minimization algorithm to critical points. Furthermore, we provide conditions under which the marginal distributions of the underlying time series can be identified. Our numerical experiments, including extensive simulations covering linear and nonlinear time series models and an application to a real-world groundwater dataset laden with missing data, corroborate the practical usefulness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DEMONet: Underwater Acoustic Target Recognition based on Multi-Expert Network and Cross-Temporal Variational Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02758v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building a robust underwater acoustic recognition system in real-world scenarios is challenging due to the complex underwater environment and the dynamic motion states of targets. A promising optimization approach is to leverage the intrinsic physical characteristics of targets, which remain invariable regardless of environmental conditions, to provide robust insights. However, our study reveals that while physical characteristics exhibit robust properties, they may lack class-specific discriminative patterns. Consequently, directly incorporating physical characteristics into model training can potentially introduce unintended inductive biases, leading to performance degradation. To utilize the benefits of physical characteristics while mitigating possible detrimental effects, we propose DEMONet in this study, which utilizes the detection of envelope modulation on noise (DEMON) to provide robust insights into the shaft frequency or blade counts of targets. DEMONet is a multi-expert network that allocates various underwater signals to their best-matched expert layer based on DEMON spectra for fine-grained signal processing. Thereinto, DEMON spectra are solely responsible for providing implicit physical characteristics without establishing a mapping relationship with the target category. Furthermore, to mitigate noise and spurious modulation spectra in DEMON features, we introduce a cross-temporal alignment strategy and employ a variational autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct noise-resistant DEMON spectra to replace the raw DEMON features. The effectiveness of the proposed DEMONet with cross-temporal VAE was primarily evaluated on the DeepShip dataset and our proprietary datasets. Experimental results demonstrated that our approach could achieve state-of-the-art performance on both datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CollaMamba: Efficient Collaborative Perception with Cross-Agent Spatial-Temporal State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07714v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By sharing complementary perceptual information, multi-agent collaborative perception fosters a deeper understanding of the environment. Recent studies on collaborative perception mostly utilize CNNs or Transformers to learn feature representation and fusion in the spatial dimension, which struggle to handle long-range spatial-temporal features under limited computing and communication resources. Holistically modeling the dependencies over extensive spatial areas and extended temporal frames is crucial to enhancing feature quality. To this end, we propose a resource efficient cross-agent spatial-temporal collaborative state space model (SSM), named CollaMamba. Initially, we construct a foundational backbone network based on spatial SSM. This backbone adeptly captures positional causal dependencies from both single-agent and cross-agent views, yielding compact and comprehensive intermediate features while maintaining linear complexity. Furthermore, we devise a history-aware feature boosting module based on temporal SSM, extracting contextual cues from extended historical frames to refine vague features while preserving low overhead. Extensive experiments across several datasets demonstrate that CollaMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving higher model accuracy while reducing computational and communication overhead by up to 71.9% and 1/64, respectively. This work pioneers the exploration of the Mamba's potential in collaborative perception. The source code will be made available.</p></details> |  |

We notice the challenge that large language models (LLMs) face when engaging in temporal reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that methods involving the generation of intermediate reasoning steps, such as chain-of-thought and program-aided language models, do not consistently boost the performance of complex temporal question-answering tasks. This limitation can be attributed to the LLMs' inadequate understanding of temporal information. To address this problem, we propose TempLogic, a novel framework designed specifically for temporal question-answering tasks across three levels of reasoning. TempLogic incorporates retrieval-guided context distillation, temporal data extraction, and tailor-made logic reasoning. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in solving intricate time-bound reasoning tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[AM Flow: Adapters for Temporal Processing in Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02065v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, in particular \textit{image} models, have recently gained generalisability and robustness. %are becoming more general and robust by the day. In this work, we propose to exploit such advances in the realm of \textit{video} classification. Video foundation models suffer from the requirement of extensive pretraining and a large training time. Towards mitigating such limitations, we propose "\textit{Attention Map (AM) Flow}" for image models, a method for identifying pixels relevant to motion in each input video frame. In this context, we propose two methods to compute AM flow, depending on camera motion. AM flow allows the separation of spatial and temporal processing, while providing improved results over combined spatio-temporal processing (as in video models). Adapters, one of the popular techniques in parameter efficient transfer learning, facilitate the incorporation of AM flow into pretrained image models, mitigating the need for full-finetuning. We extend adapters to "\textit{temporal processing adapters}" by incorporating a temporal processing unit into the adapters. Our work achieves faster convergence, therefore reducing the number of epochs needed for training. Moreover, we endow an image model with the ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on popular action recognition datasets. This reduces training time and simplifies pretraining. We present experiments on Kinetics-400, Something-Something v2, and Toyota Smarthome datasets, showcasing state-of-the-art or comparable results.</p></details> |  |
| **[TRACE: Temporal Grounding Video LLM via Causal Event Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05643v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) is a crucial capability for video understanding models and plays a vital role in downstream tasks such as video browsing and editing. To effectively handle various tasks simultaneously and enable zero-shot prediction, there is a growing trend in employing video LLMs for VTG tasks. However, current video LLM-based methods rely exclusively on natural language generation, lacking the ability to model the clear structure inherent in videos, which restricts their effectiveness in tackling VTG tasks. To address this issue, this paper first formally introduces causal event modeling framework, which represents videos as sequences of events, and predict the current event using previous events, video inputs, and textural instructions. Each event consists of three components: timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions. We then propose a novel task-interleaved video LLM called TRACE to effectively implement the causal event modeling framework in practice. The TRACE processes visual frames, timestamps, salient scores, and text as distinct tasks, employing various encoders and decoding heads for each. Task tokens are arranged in an interleaved sequence according to the causal event modeling framework's formulation. Extensive experiments on various VTG tasks and datasets demonstrate the superior performance of TRACE compared to state-of-the-art video LLMs. Our model and code are available at \url{https://github.com/gyxxyg/TRACE}.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods often focus solely on spatial or temporal features, limiting their ability to comprehend complex human activities fully. Our proposed model integrates joint, motion, and temporal information through a multi-stream fusion architecture. Specifically, it comprises a joint stream for extracting skeleton features, a temporal stream for capturing dynamic temporal features, and an ARN-LSTM block that utilizes Time-Distributed Long Short-Term Memory (TD-LSTM) layers followed by an Attention Relation Network (ARN) to model temporal relations. The outputs from these streams are fused in a fully connected layer to provide the final action prediction. Evaluations on the NTU RGB+D 60 and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving effective performance, particularly in group activity recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedASTA: Federated adaptive spatial-temporal attention for traffic flow prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13090v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT) devices nowadays generate a large amount of heterogeneous spatial-temporal data. It remains a challenging problem to model the spatial-temporal dynamics under privacy concern. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a framework to enable model training across distributed devices without sharing original data which reduce privacy concern. Personalized federated learning (PFL) methods further address data heterogenous problem. However, these methods don't consider natural spatial relations among nodes. For the sake of modeling spatial relations, Graph Neural Netowork (GNN) based FL approach have been proposed. But dynamic spatial-temporal relations among edge nodes are not taken into account. Several approaches model spatial-temporal dynamics in a centralized environment, while less effort has been made under federated setting. To overcome these challeges, we propose a novel Federated Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Attention (FedASTA) framework to model the dynamic spatial-temporal relations. On the client node, FedASTA extracts temporal relations and trend patterns from the decomposed terms of original time series. Then, on the server node, FedASTA utilize trend patterns from clients to construct adaptive temporal-spatial aware graph which captures dynamic correlation between clients. Besides, we design a masked spatial attention module with both static graph and constructed adaptive graph to model spatial dependencies among clients. Extensive experiments on five real-world public traffic flow datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-art performance in federated scenario. In addition, the experiments made in centralized setting show the effectiveness of our novel adaptive graph construction approach compared with other popular dynamic spatial-temporal aware methods.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately capturing interactions across multiple spatial and temporal scales remains a significant challenge. We present a novel framework that jointly models spatial and temporal multiscale interactions in molecular dynamics. Our approach leverages Graph Fourier Transforms to decompose molecular structures into different spatial scales and employs Neural Ordinary Differential Equations to model the temporal dynamics in a curated manner influenced by the spatial modes. This unified framework links spatial structures with temporal evolution in a flexible manner, enabling more accurate and comprehensive simulations of molecular systems. We evaluate our model on the MD17 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over state-of-the-art baselines across multiple molecules, particularly under challenging conditions such as irregular timestep sampling and long-term prediction horizons. Ablation studies confirm the significant contributions of both spatial and temporal multiscale modeling components. Our method advances the simulation of complex molecular systems, potentially accelerating research in computational chemistry, drug discovery, and materials science.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we propose BiT-MamSleep, a novel architecture that integrates the Triple-Resolution CNN (TRCNN) for efficient multi-scale feature extraction with the Bidirectional Mamba (BiMamba) mechanism, which models both short- and long-term temporal dependencies through bidirectional processing of EEG data. Additionally, BiT-MamSleep incorporates an Adaptive Feature Recalibration (AFR) module and a temporal enhancement block to dynamically refine feature importance, optimizing classification accuracy without increasing computational complexity. To further improve robustness, we apply optimization techniques such as Focal Loss and SMOTE to mitigate class imbalance. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that BiT-MamSleep significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in handling long EEG sequences and addressing class imbalance, leading to more accurate and scalable sleep stage classification.</p></details> |  |

Predicting future events typically relies on closely related historical facts, yielding more accurate results for repetitive or periodic events. However, for future events with sparse historical interactions, the effectiveness of this method, which focuses on leveraging high-frequency historical information, diminishes. Recently, the capabilities of diffusion models in image generation have opened new opportunities for TKG reasoning. Therefore, we propose a graph node diffusion model with dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL-Diff). Graph node diffusion model (GNDiff) introduces noise into sparsely related events to simulate new events, generating high-quality data that better conforms to the actual distribution. This generative mechanism significantly enhances the model's ability to reason about new events. Additionally, the dual-domain periodic contrastive learning (DPCL) maps periodic and non-periodic event entities to Poincar\'e and Euclidean spaces, leveraging their characteristics to distinguish similar periodic events effectively. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that DPCL-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art TKG models in event prediction, demonstrating our approach's effectiveness. This study also investigates the combined effectiveness of GNDiff and DPCL in TKG tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Learning Hidden Subgoals under Temporal Ordering Constraints in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01425v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world applications, the success of completing a task is often determined by multiple key steps which are distant in time steps and have to be achieved in a fixed time order. For example, the key steps listed on the cooking recipe should be achieved one-by-one in the right time order. These key steps can be regarded as subgoals of the task and their time orderings are described as temporal ordering constraints. However, in many real-world problems, subgoals or key states are often hidden in the state space and their temporal ordering constraints are also unknown, which make it challenging for previous RL algorithms to solve this kind of tasks. In order to address this issue, in this work we propose a novel RL algorithm for {\bf l}earning hidden {\bf s}ubgoals under {\bf t}emporal {\bf o}rdering {\bf c}onstraints (LSTOC). We propose a new contrastive learning objective which can effectively learn hidden subgoals (key states) and their temporal orderings at the same time, based on first-occupancy representation and temporal geometric sampling. In addition, we propose a sample-efficient learning strategy to discover subgoals one-by-one following their temporal order constraints by building a subgoal tree to represent discovered subgoals and their temporal ordering relationships. Specifically, this tree can be used to improve the sample efficiency of trajectory collection, fasten the task solving and generalize to unseen tasks. The LSTOC framework is evaluated on several environments with image-based observations, showing its significant improvement over baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

The inherent uncertainty and variability in such data often render deterministic models insufficient, prompting a shift towards probabilistic approaches, where diffusion-based generative models have emerged as effective solutions. In this paper, we present ProGen, a novel framework for probabilistic spatiotemporal time series forecasting that leverages Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and diffusion-based generative modeling techniques in the continuous domain. By integrating a novel denoising score model, graph neural networks, and a tailored SDE, ProGen provides a robust solution that effectively captures spatiotemporal dependencies while managing uncertainty. Our extensive experiments on four benchmark traffic datasets demonstrate that ProGen outperforms state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic models. This work contributes a continuous, diffusion-based generative approach to spatiotemporal forecasting, paving the way for future research in probabilistic modeling and stochastic processes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to address the complex, temporally dynamic nature of endoscopic scenes. This paper presents ST-Endo4DGS, a novel framework that models the spatio-temporal volume of dynamic endoscopic scenes using unbiased 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) primitives, parameterized by anisotropic ellipses with flexible 4D rotations. This approach enables precise representation of deformable tissue dynamics, capturing intricate spatial and temporal correlations in real time. Additionally, we extend spherindrical harmonics to represent time-evolving appearance, achieving realistic adaptations to lighting and view changes. A new endoscopic normal alignment constraint (ENAC) further enhances geometric fidelity by aligning rendered normals with depth-derived geometry. Extensive evaluations show that ST-Endo4DGS outperforms existing methods in both visual quality and real-time performance, establishing a new state-of-the-art in dynamic scene reconstruction for endoscopic surgery.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unifying Approach to Product Constructions for Quantitative Temporal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10465v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs are a powerful and convenient approach to formalise distributions over system executions. A classical verification problem for probabilistic programs is temporal inference: to compute the likelihood that the execution traces satisfy a given temporal property. This paper presents a general framework for temporal inference, which applies to a rich variety of quantitative models including those that arise in the operational semantics of probabilistic and weighted programs. The key idea underlying our framework is that in a variety of existing approaches, the main construction that enables temporal inference is that of a product between the system of interest and the temporal property. We provide a unifying mathematical definition of product constructions, enabled by the realisation that 1) both systems and temporal properties can be modelled as coalgebras and 2) product constructions are distributive laws in this context. Our categorical framework leads us to our main contribution: a sufficient condition for correctness, which is precisely what enables to use the product construction for temporal inference. We show that our framework can be instantiated to naturally recover a number of disparate approaches from the literature including, e.g., partial expected rewards in Markov reward models, resource-sensitive reachability analysis, and weighted optimization problems. Further, we demonstrate a product of weighted programs and weighted temporal properties as a new instance to show the scalability of our approach.</p></details> | Preprint |

In an offline setting, the context is typically captured by the segmentation network after observing the entire sequence. However, capturing and using such context information in an online setting remains an under-explored problem. This work presents the an online framework for temporal action segmentation. At the core of the framework is an adaptive memory designed to accommodate dynamic changes in context over time, alongside a feature augmentation module that enhances the frames with the memory. In addition, we propose a post-processing approach to mitigate the severe over-segmentation in the online setting. On three common segmentation benchmarks, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 12 tables.

| **[Robot Policy Learning with Temporal Optimal Transport Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21795v2)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward specification is one of the most tricky problems in Reinforcement Learning, which usually requires tedious hand engineering in practice. One promising approach to tackle this challenge is to adopt existing expert video demonstrations for policy learning. Some recent work investigates how to learn robot policies from only a single/few expert video demonstrations. For example, reward labeling via Optimal Transport (OT) has been shown to be an effective strategy to generate a proxy reward by measuring the alignment between the robot trajectory and the expert demonstrations. However, previous work mostly overlooks that the OT reward is invariant to temporal order information, which could bring extra noise to the reward signal. To address this issue, in this paper, we introduce the Temporal Optimal Transport (TemporalOT) reward to incorporate temporal order information for learning a more accurate OT-based proxy reward. Extensive experiments on the Meta-world benchmark tasks validate the efficacy of the proposed method. Code is available at: https://github.com/fuyw/TemporalOT</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

Our approach captures temporal and feature dependencies within a unified spatio-temporal pipeline by leveraging a GCNN that uses a spatio-temporal graph aimed at optimizing predictive accuracy and interoperability. For graph estimation, we introduce techniques, including one based on the (heterogeneous) Gower distance. Once estimated, we propose two methods for graph construction: one based on the Cartesian product, treating temporal instants homogeneously, and another spatio-temporal approach with distinct graphs per time step. We also propose two GCNN architectures: a standard GCNN with a normalized adjacency matrix and a higher-order polynomial GCNN. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize explainability by designing an inherently interpretable model and performing a thorough interpretability analysis, identifying key feature-time combinations that drive predictions. We evaluate XST-GCNN using real-world Electronic Health Record data from University Hospital of Fuenlabrada to predict Multidrug Resistance (MDR) in ICU patients, a critical healthcare challenge linked to high mortality and complex treatments. Our architecture outperforms traditional models, achieving a mean ROC-AUC score of 81.03 +- 2.43. Furthermore, the interpretability analysis provides actionable insights into clinical factors driving MDR predictions, enhancing model transparency. This work sets a benchmark for tackling complex inference tasks with heterogeneous MTS, offering a versatile, interpretable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CTPD: Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery for Enhanced Multimodal Electronic Health Records Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00696v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating multimodal Electronic Health Records (EHR) data, such as numerical time series and free-text clinical reports, has great potential in predicting clinical outcomes. However, prior work has primarily focused on capturing temporal interactions within individual samples and fusing multimodal information, overlooking critical temporal patterns across patients. These patterns, such as trends in vital signs like abnormal heart rate or blood pressure, can indicate deteriorating health or an impending critical event. Similarly, clinical notes often contain textual descriptions that reflect these patterns. Identifying corresponding temporal patterns across different modalities is crucial for improving the accuracy of clinical outcome predictions, yet it remains a challenging task. To address this gap, we introduce a Cross-Modal Temporal Pattern Discovery (CTPD) framework, designed to efficiently extract meaningful cross-modal temporal patterns from multimodal EHR data. Our approach introduces shared initial temporal pattern representations which are refined using slot attention to generate temporal semantic embeddings. To ensure rich cross-modal temporal semantics in the learned patterns, we introduce a contrastive-based TPNCE loss for cross-modal alignment, along with two reconstruction losses to retain core information of each modality. Evaluations on two clinically critical tasks, 48-hour in-hospital mortality and 24-hour phenotype classification, using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing approaches.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[STAA: Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution for Real-Time Interpreting Transformer-based Video Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00630v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various computer vision tasks, including image and video analysis. However, Transformer's complex architecture and black-box nature pose challenges for explainability, a crucial aspect for real-world applications and scientific inquiry. Current Explainable AI (XAI) methods can only provide one-dimensional feature importance, either spatial or temporal explanation, with significant computational complexity. This paper introduces STAA (Spatio-Temporal Attention Attribution), an XAI method for interpreting video Transformer models. Differ from traditional methods that separately apply image XAI techniques for spatial features or segment contribution analysis for temporal aspects, STAA offers both spatial and temporal information simultaneously from attention values in Transformers. The study utilizes the Kinetics-400 dataset, a benchmark collection of 400 human action classes used for action recognition research. We introduce metrics to quantify explanations. We also apply optimization to enhance STAA's raw output. By implementing dynamic thresholding and attention focusing mechanisms, we improve the signal-to-noise ratio in our explanations, resulting in more precise visualizations and better evaluation results. In terms of computational overhead, our method requires less than 3\% of the computational resources of traditional XAI methods, making it suitable for real-time video XAI analysis applications. STAA contributes to the growing field of XAI by offering a method for researchers and practitioners to analyze Transformer models.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Bridge Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneity in Link Prediction? A Contrastive Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00612v1)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Heterogeneous Networks play a crucial role in capturing the dynamics and heterogeneity inherent in various real-world complex systems, rendering them a noteworthy research avenue for link prediction. However, existing methods fail to capture the fine-grained differential distribution patterns and temporal dynamic characteristics, which we refer to as spatial heterogeneity and temporal heterogeneity. To overcome such limitations, we propose a novel \textbf{C}ontrastive Learning-based \textbf{L}ink \textbf{P}rediction model, \textbf{CLP}, which employs a multi-view hierarchical self-supervised architecture to encode spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Specifically, aiming at spatial heterogeneity, we develop a spatial feature modeling layer to capture the fine-grained topological distribution patterns from node- and edge-level representations, respectively. Furthermore, aiming at temporal heterogeneity, we devise a temporal information modeling layer to perceive the evolutionary dependencies of dynamic graph topologies from time-level representations. Finally, we encode the spatial and temporal distribution heterogeneity from a contrastive learning perspective, enabling a comprehensive self-supervised hierarchical relation modeling for the link prediction task. Extensive experiments conducted on four real-world dynamic heterogeneous network datasets verify that our \mymodel consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art models, demonstrating an average improvement of 10.10\%, 13.44\% in terms of AUC and AP, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disentangling spatio-temporal knowledge for weakly supervised object detection and segmentation in surgical video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15794v4)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised video object segmentation (WSVOS) enables the identification of segmentation maps without requiring an extensive training dataset of object masks, relying instead on coarse video labels indicating object presence. Current state-of-the-art methods either require multiple independent stages of processing that employ motion cues or, in the case of end-to-end trainable networks, lack in segmentation accuracy, in part due to the difficulty of learning segmentation maps from videos with transient object presence. This limits the application of WSVOS for semantic annotation of surgical videos where multiple surgical tools frequently move in and out of the field of view, a problem that is more difficult than typically encountered in WSVOS. This paper introduces Video Spatio-Temporal Disentanglement Networks (VDST-Net), a framework to disentangle spatiotemporal information using semi-decoupled knowledge distillation to predict high-quality class activation maps (CAMs). A teacher network designed to resolve temporal conflicts when specifics about object location and timing in the video are not provided works with a student network that integrates information over time by leveraging temporal dependencies. We demonstrate the efficacy of our framework on a public reference dataset and on a more challenging surgical video dataset where objects are, on average, present in less than 60\% of annotated frames. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and generates superior segmentation masks under video-level weak supervision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV)</p></details> |

Recent catastrophic events in Pakistan and New Zealand underscore the urgent need for precise flood mapping to guide restoration efforts, understand vulnerabilities, and prepare for future occurrences. While Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing offers day-and-night, all-weather imaging capabilities, its application in deep learning for flood segmentation is limited by the lack of large annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce Kuro Siwo, a manually annotated multi-temporal dataset, spanning 43 flood events globally. Our dataset maps more than 338 billion $m^2$ of land, with 33 billion designated as either flooded areas or permanent water bodies. Kuro Siwo includes a highly processed product optimized for flood mapping based on SAR Ground Range Detected, and a primal SAR Single Look Complex product with minimal preprocessing, designed to promote research on the exploitation of both the phase and amplitude information and to offer maximum flexibility for downstream task preprocessing. To leverage advances in large scale self-supervised pretraining methods for remote sensing data, we augment Kuro Siwo with a large unlabeled set of SAR samples. Finally, we provide an extensive benchmark, namely BlackBench, offering strong baselines for a diverse set of flood events from Europe, America, Africa, Asia and Australia.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024) Track on Datasets and Benchmarks</p></details> |

If these components are found, they can be modelled univariately. Blind source separation aims to recover the latent components by estimating the unmixing transformation based on the observed data only. The current methods for spatio-temporal blind source separation are restricted to linear unmixing, and nonlinear variants have not been implemented. In this paper, we extend identifiable variational autoencoder to the nonlinear nonstationary spatio-temporal blind source separation setting and demonstrate its performance using comprehensive simulation studies. Additionally, we introduce two alternative methods for the latent dimension estimation, which is a crucial task in order to obtain the correct latent representation. Finally, we illustrate the proposed methods using a meteorological application, where we estimate the latent dimension and the latent components, interpret the components, and show how nonstationarity can be accounted and prediction accuracy can be improved by using the proposed nonlinear blind source separation method as a preprocessing method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human Action Recognition (HAR) Using Skeleton-based Spatial Temporal Relative Transformer Network: ST-RTR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23806v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human Action Recognition (HAR) is an interesting research area in human-computer interaction used to monitor the activities of elderly and disabled individuals affected by physical and mental health. In the recent era, skeleton-based HAR has received much attention because skeleton data has shown that it can handle changes in striking, body size, camera views, and complex backgrounds. One key characteristic of ST-GCN is automatically learning spatial and temporal patterns from skeleton sequences. It has some limitations, as this method only works for short-range correlation due to its limited receptive field. Consequently, understanding human action requires long-range interconnection. To address this issue, we developed a spatial-temporal relative transformer ST-RTR model. The ST-RTR includes joint and relay nodes, which allow efficient communication and data transmission within the network. These nodes help to break the inherent spatial and temporal skeleton topologies, which enables the model to understand long-range human action better. Furthermore, we combine ST-RTR with a fusion model for further performance improvements. To assess the performance of the ST-RTR method, we conducted experiments on three skeleton-based HAR benchmarks: NTU RGB+D 60, NTU RGB+D 120, and UAV-Human. It boosted CS and CV by 2.11 % and 1.45% on NTU RGB+D 60, 1.25% and 1.05% on NTU RGB+D 120. On UAV-Human datasets, accuracy improved by 2.54%. The experimental outcomes explain that the proposed ST-RTR model significantly improves action recognition associated with the standard ST-GCN method.</p></details> |  |

Understanding traffic speeds on any given road segment can be highly beneficial for traffic management strategists seeking to reduce congestion. While recent studies have primarily focused on modeling spatial dependencies by using graph convolutional networks (GCNs) over fixed weighted graphs, the relationships between nodes are often more complex, with edges that interact dynamically. This paper addresses both the temporal patterns in traffic data and the intricate spatial dependencies by introducing the Signal-Enhanced Graph Convolutional Network Long Short Term Memory (SGCN-LSTM) model for predicting traffic speeds across road networks. Extensive experiments on the PEMS-BAY road network traffic dataset demonstrate the SGCN-LSTM model's effectiveness, yielding significant improvements in Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) compared to benchmark models on the same dataset.</p></details> | 5 pages, 6 figures |

We construct a dataset containing audio samples from music covers on YouTube along with the audio of the original song, and sentiment scores derived from user comments, serving as proxy labels for content quality. Our approach involves extensive pre-processing, segmenting audio signals into 30-second windows, and extracting high-dimensional feature representations through Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Chroma, Spectral Contrast, and Temporal characteristics. Leveraging these features, we train regression models to predict sentiment scores on a 0-100 scale, achieving root mean square error (RMSE) values of 3.420, 5.482, 2.783, and 4.212, respectively. Improvements over a baseline model based on absolute difference metrics are observed.

This is because whole sequence segmentation is currently a tedious process and inaccurate. Conventional whole sequence segmentation approaches first estimate the motion field between frames, which is then used to propagate the mask along the temporal axis. However, the mask propagation results could be prone to error, especially for the basal and apex slices, where through-plane motion leads to significant morphology and structural change during the cardiac cycle. Inspired by recent advances in video object segmentation (VOS), based on spatio-temporal memory (STM) networks, we propose a continuous STM (CSTM) network for semi-supervised whole heart and whole sequence cMR segmentation. Our CSTM network takes full advantage of the spatial, scale, temporal and through-plane continuity prior of the underlying heart anatomy structures, to achieve accurate and fast 4D segmentation. Results of extensive experiments across multiple cMR datasets show that our method can improve the 4D cMR segmentation performance, especially for the hard-to-segment regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2025</p></details> |

The task, however, is very challenging since there are time delays between extremes and their drivers, and the spatial response of such drivers is inhomogeneous. In this work, we propose a first approach and benchmarks to tackle this challenge. Our approach is trained end-to-end to predict spatio-temporally extremes and spatio-temporally drivers in the physical input variables jointly. By enforcing the network to predict extremes from spatio-temporal binary masks of identified drivers, the network successfully identifies drivers that are correlated with extremes. We evaluate our approach on three newly created synthetic benchmarks, where two of them are based on remote sensing or reanalysis climate data, and on two real-world reanalysis datasets.

Large Language Models (LLM) have recently shown promising performance in temporal reasoning tasks such as temporal question answering. Nevertheless, recent studies have tested the LLMs' performance in detecting temporal relations of closed-source models only, limiting the interpretability of those results. In this work, we investigate LLMs' performance and decision process in the Temporal Relation Classification task. First, we assess the performance of seven open and closed-sourced LLMs experimenting with in-context learning and lightweight fine-tuning approaches. Results show that LLMs with in-context learning significantly underperform smaller encoder-only models based on RoBERTa. Then, we delve into the possible reasons for this gap by applying explainable methods. The outcome suggests a limitation of LLMs in this task due to their autoregressive nature, which causes them to focus only on the last part of the sequence. Additionally, we evaluate the word embeddings of these two models to better understand their pre-training differences.

The violation of these assumptions, which in applied settings is increasingly likely as the dimensionality of the time series being analyzed grows, can dramatically curtail the sensitivity or the accuracy of these methods. We propose AJDN (Asynchronous Jump Detection under Nonstationary noise). AJDN is a high dimensional multiscale jump detection method that tests and estimates jumps in an otherwise smoothly varying mean function for high dimensional time series with nonstationary noise where the jumps across dimensions may not occur at the same time. AJDN is correct in the sense that it detects the correct number of jumps with a prescribed probability asymptotically and its accuracy in estimating the locations of the jumps is asymptotically nearly optimal under the asynchronous jump assumption. Through a simulation study we demonstrate AJDN's robustness across a wide variety of stationary and nonstationary high dimensional time series, and we show its strong performance relative to some existing high dimensional changepoint detection methods. We apply AJDN to a seismic time series to demonstrate its ability to accurately detect jumps in real-world high dimensional time series with complex temporal dynamics.</p></details> |  |

Recently, transformer based models have shown remarkable potential in weather forecasting achieving state-of-the-art results. However, transformers are discrete and physics-agnostic models which limit their ability to learn the continuous spatio-temporal features of the dynamical weather system. We address this issue with STC-ViT, a Spatio-Temporal Continuous Vision Transformer for weather forecasting. STC-ViT incorporates the continuous time Neural ODE layers with multi-head attention mechanism to learn the continuous weather evolution over time. The attention mechanism is encoded as a differentiable function in the transformer architecture to model the complex weather dynamics. Further, we define a customised physics informed loss for STC-ViT which penalize the model's predictions for deviating away from physical laws. We evaluate STC-ViT against operational Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) model and several deep learning based weather forecasting models. STC-ViT, trained on 1.5-degree 6-hourly data, demonstrates computational efficiency and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art data-driven models trained on higher-resolution data for global forecasting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Attention and Cognitive Control Costs Using Temporally-Layered Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18701v3)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current reinforcement learning framework focuses exclusively on performance, often at the expense of efficiency. In contrast, biological control achieves remarkable performance while also optimizing computational energy expenditure and decision frequency. We propose a Decision Bounded Markov Decision Process (DB-MDP), that constrains the number of decisions and computational energy available to agents in reinforcement learning environments. Our experiments demonstrate that existing reinforcement learning algorithms struggle within this framework, leading to either failure or suboptimal performance. To address this, we introduce a biologically-inspired, Temporally Layered Architecture (TLA), enabling agents to manage computational costs through two layers with distinct time scales and energy requirements. TLA achieves optimal performance in decision-bounded environments and in continuous control environments, it matches state-of-the-art performance while utilizing a fraction of the compute cost. Compared to current reinforcement learning algorithms that solely prioritize performance, our approach significantly lowers computational energy expenditure while maintaining performance. These findings establish a benchmark and pave the way for future research on energy and time-aware control.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 Pa...</summary><p>50 Pages, 9 Figures, 6 Tables.

We study this setting, as well as a number of its special cases formed by the restrictions to two agents, same goods on each day, identical preferences, or combinations thereof, and chart out the landscape of achieving two types of fairness guarantees simultaneously: fairness on each day (per day) and fairness over time (up to each day, or the weaker version, overall). In the most general setting, we prove that there always exists an allocation that is stochastically-dominant envy-free up to one good (SD-EF1) per day and proportional up to one good (PROP1) overall, and when all the agents have identical preferences, we show that SD-EF1 per day and SD-EF1 overall can be guaranteed. For the case of two agents, we prove that SD-EF1 per day and EF1 up to each day can be guaranteed using an envy balancing technique. We provide counterexamples for other combinations that establish our results as among the best guarantees possible, but also leaving open some tantalizing questions.</p></details> |  |

As such, gaze deployment crucially is a temporal process. Existing computational models have made significant strides in predicting spatial aspects of observer's visual scanpaths (where to look), while often putting on the background the temporal facet of attention dynamics (when). In this paper we present TPP-Gaze, a novel and principled approach to model scanpath dynamics based on Neural Temporal Point Process (TPP), that jointly learns the temporal dynamics of fixations position and duration, integrating deep learning methodologies with point process theory. We conduct extensive experiments across five publicly available datasets. Our results show the overall superior performance of the proposed model compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |

Given a series of frames as input, our method quickly and accurately extracts time-remaining and quarter values from basketball broadcast scenes. Our work intends to expedite the development of large, multi-modal video datasets to train data-hungry video models in the sports action recognition domain. Our method aligns a pre-labeled corpus of play-by-play annotations containing dense event annotations to video frames, enabling quick retrieval of labeled video segments. Unlike previous methods, we forgo the need to localize game clocks by fine-tuning an out-of-the-box object detector to find semantic text regions directly. Our end-to-end approach improves the generality of our work. Additionally, interpolation and parallelization techniques prepare our pipeline for deployment in a large computing cluster.

However, the scarcity of data coupled with the high expenses involved in sensor deployment results in notable data imbalances. Furthermore, models that are excessively customized and devoid of causal connections further undermine the generalizability and interpretability. To this end, we establish a causal framework for ST predictions, termed CaPaint, which targets to identify causal regions in data and endow model with causal reasoning ability in a two-stage process. Going beyond this process, we utilize the back-door adjustment to specifically address the sub-regions identified as non-causal in the upstream phase. Specifically, we employ a novel image inpainting technique. By using a fine-tuned unconditional Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as the generative prior, we in-fill the masks defined as environmental parts, offering the possibility of reliable extrapolation for potential data distributions. CaPaint overcomes the high complexity dilemma of optimal ST causal discovery models by reducing the data generation complexity from exponential to quasi-linear levels. Extensive experiments conducted on five real-world ST benchmarks demonstrate that integrating the CaPaint concept allows models to achieve improvements ranging from 4.3% to 77.3%. Moreover, compared to traditional mainstream ST augmenters, CaPaint underscores the potential of diffusion models in ST enhancement, offering a novel paradigm for this field.

However, numerous benign conditions can cause increased uptake of radiopharmaceuticals, confounding differentiation from malignant tumors. Several studies have indicated that dual-time PET imaging holds promise in distinguishing between malignant and benign tumor processes. Nevertheless, the hour-long distribution period of radiopharmaceuticals post-injection complicates the determination of optimal timing for the second scan, presenting challenges in both practical applications and research. Notably, we have identified that delay time PET imaging can be framed as an image-to-image conversion problem. Motivated by this insight, we propose a novel spatial-temporal guided diffusion transformer probabilistic model (st-DTPM) to solve dual-time PET imaging prediction problem. Specifically, this architecture leverages the U-net framework that integrates patch-wise features of CNN and pixel-wise relevance of Transformer to obtain local and global information. And then employs a conditional DDPM model for image synthesis. Furthermore, on spatial condition, we concatenate early scan PET images and noisy PET images on every denoising step to guide the spatial distribution of denoising sampling. On temporal condition, we convert diffusion time steps and delay time to a universal time vector, then embed it to each layer of model architecture to further improve the accuracy of predictions. Experimental results demonstrated the superiority of our method over alternative approaches in preserving image quality and structural information, thereby affirming its efficacy in predictive task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Drift, Diffusion, and Causal Structure from Temporal Snapshots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22729v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are a fundamental tool for modelling dynamic processes, including gene regulatory networks (GRNs), contaminant transport, financial markets, and image generation. However, learning the underlying SDE from observational data is a challenging task, especially when individual trajectories are not observable. Motivated by burgeoning research in single-cell datasets, we present the first comprehensive approach for jointly estimating the drift and diffusion of an SDE from its temporal marginals. Assuming linear drift and additive diffusion, we prove that these parameters are identifiable from marginals if and only if the initial distribution is not invariant to a class of generalized rotations, a condition that is satisfied by most distributions. We further prove that the causal graph of any SDE with additive diffusion can be recovered from the SDE parameters. To complement this theory, we adapt entropy-regularized optimal transport to handle anisotropic diffusion, and introduce APPEX (Alternating Projection Parameter Estimation from $X_0$), an iterative algorithm designed to estimate the drift, diffusion, and causal graph of an additive noise SDE, solely from temporal marginals. We show that each of these steps are asymptotically optimal with respect to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and demonstrate APPEX's effectiveness on simulated data from linear additive noise SDEs.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods can only predict up to four hours in the future, which doesn't quite meet real-world demands. we identify that the prediction horizon is limited to a few hours mainly due to the separation of temporal and spatial factors, which results in high complexity. Drawing inspiration from Albert Einstein's relativity theory, which suggests space and time are unified and inseparable, we introduce Extralonger, which unifies temporal and spatial factors. Extralonger notably extends the prediction horizon to a week on real-world benchmarks, demonstrating superior efficiency in the training time, inference time, and memory usage. It sets new standards in long-term and extra-long-term scenarios.

| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches cannot capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations in TKGs. To this end, we propose a Deep Evolutionary Clustering jointed temporal knowledge graph Representation Learning approach (DECRL). Specifically, a deep evolutionary clustering module is proposed to capture the temporal evolution of high-order correlations among entities. Furthermore, a cluster-aware unsupervised alignment mechanism is introduced to ensure the precise one-to-one alignment of soft overlapping clusters across timestamps, thereby maintaining the temporal smoothness of clusters. In addition, an implicit correlation encoder is introduced to capture latent correlations between any pair of clusters under the guidance of a global graph. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that DECRL achieves the state-of-the-art performances, outperforming the best baseline by an average of 9.53%, 12.98%, 10.42%, and 14.68% in MRR, Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024, 17 pages, and 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Cops & Robber on Periodic Temporal Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22618v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the Cops and Robber pursuit-evasion game when the edge-set of the graph is allowed to change in time, possibly at every round. Specifically, the game is played on an infinite periodic sequence $\mathcal{G} = (G_0, \dots, G_{p-1})^*$ of graphs on the same set $V$ of $n$ vertices: in round $t$, the topology of $\mathcal{G}$ is $G_i=(V,E_i)$ where $i\equiv t \pmod{p}$. Concentrating on the case of a single cop, we provide a characterization of copwin periodic temporal graphs, establishing several basic properties on their nature, and extending to the temporal domain classical C&R concepts such as covers and corners. Based on these results, we design an efficient algorithm for determining if a periodic temporal graph is copwin. We also consider the case of $k>1$ cops. By shifting from a representation in terms of directed graphs to one in terms of directed multi-hypergraphs, we prove that all the fundamental properties established for $k=1$ continue to hold, providing a characterization of $k$-copwin periodic graphs, as well as a general strategy to determine if a periodic graph is $k$-copwin. Our results do not rely on any assumption on properties such as connectivity, symmetry, reflexivity held by the individual graphs in the sequence. They are established for a unified version of the game that includes the standard games studied in the literature, both for undirected and directed graphs, and both when the players are fully active and when they are not. They hold also for a variety of settings not considered in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal and Spatial Super Resolution with Latent Diffusion Model in Medical MRI images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23898v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Super Resolution (SR) plays a critical role in computer vision, particularly in medical imaging, where hardware and acquisition time constraints often result in low spatial and temporal resolution. While diffusion models have been applied for both spatial and temporal SR, few studies have explored their use for joint spatial and temporal SR, particularly in medical imaging. In this work, we address this gap by proposing to use a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) combined with a Vector Quantised GAN (VQGAN)-based encoder-decoder architecture for joint super resolution. We frame SR as an image denoising problem, focusing on improving both spatial and temporal resolution in medical images. Using the cardiac MRI dataset from the Data Science Bowl Cardiac Challenge, consisting of 2D cine images with a spatial resolution of 256x256 and 8-14 slices per time-step, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our LDM model achieves Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 30.37, Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) of 0.7580, and Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) of 0.2756, outperforming simple baseline method by 5% in PSNR, 6.5% in SSIM, 39% in LPIPS. Our LDM model generates images with high fidelity and perceptual quality with 15 diffusion steps. These results suggest that LDMs hold promise for advancing super resolution in medical imaging, potentially enhancing diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes.

| **[A Spatial-Spectral and Temporal Dual Prototype Network for Motor Imagery Brain-Computer Interface](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03177v2)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) decoding plays a crucial role in developing motor imagery brain-computer interfaces (MI-BCIs). However, decoding intentions from MI remains challenging due to the inherent complexity of EEG signals relative to the small-sample size. To address this issue, we propose a spatial-spectral and temporal dual prototype network (SST-DPN). First, we design a lightweight attention mechanism to uniformly model the spatial-spectral relationships across multiple EEG electrodes, enabling the extraction of powerful spatial-spectral features. Then, we develop a multi-scale variance pooling module tailored for EEG signals to capture long-term temporal features. This module is parameter-free and computationally efficient, offering clear advantages over the widely used transformer models. Furthermore, we introduce dual prototype learning to optimize the feature space distribution and training process, thereby improving the model's generalization ability on small-sample MI datasets. Our experimental results show that the SST-DPN outperforms state-of-the-art models with superior classification accuracy (84.11% for dataset BCI4-2A, 86.65% for dataset BCI4-2B). Additionally, we use the BCI3-4A dataset with fewer training data to further validate the generalization ability of the proposed SST-DPN. We also achieve superior performance with 82.03% classification accuracy. Benefiting from the lightweight parameters and superior decoding accuracy, our SST-DPN shows great potential for practical MI-BCI applications.

However, with the development of technology, the increasing size and complexity of data, and the lack of labels for relevant abnormal data, it is becoming increasingly challenging to perform effective and accurate anomaly detection in high-dimensional and complex data sets. In this paper, we propose a hypergraph based spatiotemporal graph convolutional neural network model STGCN_Hyper, which explicitly captures high-order, multi-hop correlations between multiple variables through a hypergraph based dynamic graph structure learning module. On this basis, we further use the hypergraph based spatiotemporal graph convolutional network to utilize the learned hypergraph structure to effectively propagate and aggregate one-hop and multi-hop related node information in the convolutional network, thereby obtaining rich spatial information. Furthermore, through the multi-scale TCN dilated convolution module, the STGCN_hyper model can also capture the dependencies of features at different scales in the temporal dimension. An unsupervised anomaly detector based on PCA and GMM is also integrated into the STGCN_hyper model. Through the anomaly score of the detector, the model can detect the anomalies in an unsupervised way. Experimental results on multiple time series datasets show that our model can flexibly learn the multi-scale time series features in the data and the dependencies between features, and outperforms most existing baseline models in terms of precision, recall, F1-score on anomaly detection tasks.

However, training of SNNs poses significant challenges due to the necessity for precise temporal and spatial credit assignment. Back-propagation through time (BPTT) algorithm, whilst the most widely used method for addressing these issues, incurs high computational cost due to its temporal dependency. In this work, we propose S-TLLR, a novel three-factor temporal local learning rule inspired by the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) mechanism, aimed at training deep SNNs on event-based learning tasks. Furthermore, S-TLLR is designed to have low memory and time complexities, which are independent of the number of time steps, rendering it suitable for online learning on low-power edge devices. To demonstrate the scalability of our proposed method, we have conducted extensive evaluations on event-based datasets spanning a wide range of applications, such as image and gesture recognition, audio classification, and optical flow estimation. In all the experiments, S-TLLR achieved high accuracy, comparable to BPTT, with a reduction in memory between $5-50\times$ and multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations between $1.3-6.6\times$.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Modeling Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22013v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sequential recommendation aims to predict the next item which interests users via modeling their interest in items over time. Most of the existing works on sequential recommendation model users' dynamic interest in specific items while overlooking users' static interest revealed by some static attribute information of items, e.g., category, or brand. Moreover, existing works often only consider the positive excitation of a user's historical interactions on his/her next choice on candidate items while ignoring the commonly existing negative excitation, resulting in insufficient modeling dynamic interest. The overlook of static interest and negative excitation will lead to incomplete interest modeling and thus impede the recommendation performance. To this end, in this paper, we propose modeling both static interest and negative excitation for dynamic interest to further improve the recommendation performance. Accordingly, we design a novel Static-Dynamic Interest Learning (SDIL) framework featured with a novel Temporal Positive and Negative Excitation Modeling (TPNE) module for accurate sequential recommendation. TPNE is specially designed for comprehensively modeling dynamic interest based on temporal positive and negative excitation learning. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that SDIL can effectively capture both static and dynamic interest and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |

In practice, temporal graphs are formalized as an ordered sequence of static graph snapshots observed at discrete time points. Sequence models such as RNNs or Transformers have long been the predominant backbone networks for modeling such temporal graphs. Yet, despite the promising results, RNNs struggle with long-range dependencies, while transformers are burdened by quadratic computational complexity. Recently, state space models (SSMs), which are framed as discretized representations of an underlying continuous-time linear dynamical system, have garnered substantial attention and achieved breakthrough advancements in independent sequence modeling. In this work, we undertake a principled investigation that extends SSM theory to temporal graphs by integrating structural information into the online approximation objective via the adoption of a Laplacian regularization term. The emergent continuous-time system introduces novel algorithmic challenges, thereby necessitating our development of GraphSSM, a graph state space model for modeling the dynamics of temporal graphs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our GraphSSM framework across various temporal graph benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Traditionally RGB cameras are used, yet for fine-grained tasks standard sensors might not be up to the task due to their latency, making it impossible to record and detect micro-movements that carry a highly informative signal, which is necessary for inferring the true emotions of a subject. Event cameras have been increasingly gaining interest as a possible solution to this and similar high-frame rate tasks. We propose a novel spatiotemporal Vision Transformer model that uses Shifted Patch Tokenization (SPT) and Locality Self-Attention (LSA) to enhance the accuracy of Action Unit classification from event streams. We also address the lack of labeled event data in the literature, which can be considered one of the main causes of an existing gap between the maturity of RGB and neuromorphic vision models. Gathering data is harder in the event domain since it cannot be crawled from the web and labeling frames should take into account event aggregation rates and the fact that static parts might not be visible in certain frames. To this end, we present FACEMORPHIC, a temporally synchronized multimodal face dataset composed of RGB videos and event streams. The dataset is annotated at a video level with facial Action Units and contains streams collected with various possible applications, ranging from 3D shape estimation to lip-reading. We then show how temporal synchronization can allow effective neuromorphic face analysis without the need to manually annotate videos: we instead leverage cross-modal supervision bridging the domain gap by representing face shapes in a 3D space. Our proposed model outperforms baseline methods by effectively capturing spatial and temporal information, crucial for recognizing subtle facial micro-expressions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at CVIU. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2409.10213</p></details> |

Traditional TDG approaches typically focus on domain data collected at fixed, discrete time intervals, which limits their capability to capture the inherent dynamics within continuous-evolving and irregularly-observed temporal domains. To overcome this, this work formalizes the concept of Continuous Temporal Domain Generalization (CTDG), where domain data are derived from continuous times and are collected at arbitrary times. CTDG tackles critical challenges including: 1) Characterizing the continuous dynamics of both data and models, 2) Learning complex high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics, and 3) Optimizing and controlling the generalization across continuous temporal domains. To address them, we propose a Koopman operator-driven continuous temporal domain generalization (Koodos) framework. We formulate the problem within a continuous dynamic system and leverage the Koopman theory to learn the underlying dynamics; the framework is further enhanced with a comprehensive optimization strategy equipped with analysis and control driven by prior knowledge of the dynamics patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network Models for Time Series Forecasting and Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22377v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatio-temporal graph neural networks (GNNs) have attracted considerable interest in the field of time series analysis, due to their ability to capture dependencies among variables and across time points. The objective of the presented systematic literature review is hence to provide a comprehensive overview of the various modeling approaches and application domains of GNNs for time series classification and forecasting. A database search was conducted, and over 150 journal papers were selected for a detailed examination of the current state-of-the-art in the field. This examination is intended to offer to the reader a comprehensive collection of proposed models, links to related source code, available datasets, benchmark models, and fitting results. All this information is hoped to assist researchers in future studies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic literature review presenting a detailed comparison of the results of current spatio-temporal GNN models in different domains. In addition, in its final part this review discusses current limitations and challenges in the application of spatio-temporal GNNs, such as comparability, reproducibility, explainability, poor information capacity, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

We present a geometric spatio-temporal point of view to the problem and show that it is possible to distinguish movement due to the turbulence vs. moving objects. To perform this task, we propose an extension of 2D cartoon+texture decomposition algorithms to 3D vector fields. Our algorithm is based on curvelet spaces which permit to better characterize the movement flow geometry. We present experiments on real data which illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Temporal Linear Network for Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21448v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has challenged the necessity of complex deep learning architectures for time series forecasting, demonstrating that simple linear models can often outperform sophisticated approaches. Building upon this insight, we introduce a novel architecture the Temporal Linear Net (TLN), that extends the capabilities of linear models while maintaining interpretability and computational efficiency. TLN is designed to effectively capture both temporal and feature-wise dependencies in multivariate time series data. Our approach is a variant of TSMixer that maintains strict linearity throughout its architecture. TSMixer removes activation functions, introduces specialized kernel initializations, and incorporates dilated convolutions to handle various time scales, while preserving the linear nature of the model. Unlike transformer-based models that may lose temporal information due to their permutation-invariant nature, TLN explicitly preserves and leverages the temporal structure of the input data. A key innovation of TLN is its ability to compute an equivalent linear model, offering a level of interpretability not found in more complex architectures such as TSMixer. This feature allows for seamless conversion between the full TLN model and its linear equivalent, facilitating both training flexibility and inference optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Architecture for Real-Time Video Anomaly Detection: Integrating Spatial and Temporal Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15909v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new architecture for real-time anomaly detection in video data, inspired by human behavior by combining spatial and temporal analyses. This approach uses two distinct models: for temporal analysis, a recurrent convolutional network (CNN + RNN) is employed, associating VGG19 and a GRU to process video sequences. Regarding spatial analysis, it is performed using YOLOv7 to analyze individual images. These two analyses can be carried out either in parallel, with a final prediction that combines the results of both analyses, or in series, where the spatial analysis enriches the data before the temporal analysis. In this article, we will compare these two architectural configurations with each other, to evaluate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach in video anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21072v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps. Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD, a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably, FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID and Correlational scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label Attention Network for Temporal Sets Prediction: You Were Looking at a Wrong Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00280v3)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most user-related data can be represented as a sequence of events associated with a timestamp and a collection of categorical labels. For example, the purchased basket of goods and the time of buying fully characterize the event of the store visit. Anticipation of the label set for the future event called the problem of temporal sets prediction, holds significant value, especially in such high-stakes industries as finance and e-commerce. A fundamental challenge of this task is the joint consideration of the temporal nature of events and label relations within sets. The existing models fail to capture complex time and label dependencies due to ineffective representation of historical information initially. We aim to address this shortcoming by presenting the framework with a specific way to aggregate the observed information into time- and set structure-aware views prior to transferring it into main architecture blocks. Our strong emphasis on input arrangement facilitates the subsequent efficient learning of label interactions. The proposed model is called Label-Attention NETwork, or LANET. We conducted experiments on four different datasets and made a comparison with four established models, including SOTA, in this area. The experimental results suggest that LANET provides significantly better quality than any other model, achieving an improvement up to $65 \%$ in terms of weighted F1 metric compared to the closest competitor. Moreover, we contemplate causal relationships between labels in our work, as well as a thorough study of LANET components' influence on performance. We provide an implementation of LANET to encourage its wider usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Spatio-Temporal Stochastic Frontier Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20915v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the literature on stochastic frontier models until the early 2000s, the joint consideration of spatial and temporal dimensions was often inadequately addressed, if not completely neglected. However, from an evolutionary economics perspective, the production process of the decision-making units constantly changes over both dimensions: it is not stable over time due to managerial enhancements and/or internal or external shocks, and is influenced by the nearest territorial neighbours. This paper proposes an extension of the Fusco and Vidoli [2013] SEM-like approach, which globally accounts for spatial and temporal effects in the term of inefficiency. In particular, coherently with the stochastic panel frontier literature, two different versions of the model are proposed: the time-invariant and the time-varying spatial stochastic frontier models. In order to evaluate the inferential properties of the proposed estimators, we first run Monte Carlo experiments and we then present the results of an application to a set of commonly referenced data, demonstrating robustness and stability of estimates across all scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables, presented at the SEA2024: XVIII World Conference of Spatial Econometrics Association (A tribute to Jean Paelinck).

| **[Glitch in Time: Exploiting Temporal Misalignment of IMU For Eavesdropping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16438v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing use of voice assistants and related applications has raised significant concerns about the security of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) in smartphones. These devices are vulnerable to acoustic eavesdropping attacks, jeopardizing user privacy. In response, Google imposed a rate limit of 200 Hz on permission-free access to IMUs, aiming to neutralize such side-channel attacks. Our research introduces a novel exploit, STAG, which circumvents these protections. It induces a temporal misalignment between the gyroscope and accelerometer, cleverly combining their data to resample at higher rates and reviving the potential for eavesdropping attacks previously curtailed by Google's security enhancements. Compared to prior methods, STAG achieves an 83.4% reduction in word error rate, highlighting its effectiveness in exploiting IMU data under restricted access and emphasizing the persistent security risks associated with these sensors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Streaming Batch Principal Component Analysis for Time Series Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20820v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multivariate time series classification, although current sequence analysis models have excellent classification capabilities, they show significant shortcomings when dealing with long sequence multivariate data, such as prolonged training times and decreased accuracy. This paper focuses on optimizing model performance for long-sequence multivariate data by mitigating the impact of extended time series and multiple variables on the model. We propose a principal component analysis (PCA)-based temporal streaming compression and dimensionality reduction algorithm for time series data (temporal streaming batch PCA, TSBPCA), which continuously updates the compact representation of the entire sequence through streaming PCA time estimation with time block updates, enhancing the data representation capability of a range of sequence analysis models. We evaluated this method using various models on five real datasets, and the experimental results show that our method performs well in terms of classification accuracy and time efficiency. Notably, our method demonstrates a trend of increasing effectiveness as sequence length grows; on the two longest sequence datasets, accuracy improved by about 7.2%, and execution time decreased by 49.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseTem: Boosting the Efficiency of CNN-Based Video Encoders by Exploiting Temporal Continuity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20790v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures |
| **[A Hierarchical Framework with Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning for Emergence Detection in Complex Adaptive Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10300v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Emergence, a global property of complex adaptive systems (CASs) constituted by interactive agents, is prevalent in real-world dynamic systems, e.g., network-level traffic congestions. Detecting its formation and evaporation helps to monitor the state of a system, allowing to issue a warning signal for harmful emergent phenomena. Since there is no centralized controller of CAS, detecting emergence based on each agent's local observation is desirable but challenging. Existing works are unable to capture emergence-related spatial patterns, and fail to model the nonlinear relationships among agents. This paper proposes a hierarchical framework with spatio-temporal consistency learning to solve these two problems by learning the system representation and agent representations, respectively. Spatio-temporal encoders composed of spatial and temporal transformers are designed to capture agents' nonlinear relationships and the system's complex evolution. Agents' and the system's representations are learned to preserve the spatio-temporal consistency by minimizing the spatial and temporal dissimilarities in a self-supervised manner in the latent space. Our method achieves more accurate detection than traditional methods and deep learning methods on three datasets with well-known yet hard-to-detect emergent behaviors. Notably, our hierarchical framework is generic in incorporating other deep learning methods for agent-level and system-level detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

Recent planning methods primarily focus on the spatial aspects, lacking the capability to directly incorporate time constraints. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages a generative model to decompose a complex planning problem into small manageable ones by incrementally generating subgoals given the current planning context. Then, we take into account the temporal information and use learned time estimators based on different statistic distributions to examine and select the generated subgoal candidates. Experiments show that planning from the current robot state to the selected subgoal can satisfy the given time-dependent constraints while being goal-oriented.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpikeReveal: Unlocking Temporal Sequences from Real Blurry Inputs with Spike Streams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09486v5)** | 2024-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing a sequence of sharp images from the blurry input is crucial for enhancing our insights into the captured scene and poses a significant challenge due to the limited temporal features embedded in the image. Spike cameras, sampling at rates up to 40,000 Hz, have proven effective in capturing motion features and beneficial for solving this ill-posed problem. Nonetheless, existing methods fall into the supervised learning paradigm, which suffers from notable performance degradation when applied to real-world scenarios that diverge from the synthetic training data domain. Moreover, the quality of reconstructed images is capped by the generated images based on motion analysis interpolation, which inherently differs from the actual scene, affecting the generalization ability of these methods in real high-speed scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first self-supervised framework for the task of spike-guided motion deblurring. Our approach begins with the formulation of a spike-guided deblurring model that explores the theoretical relationships among spike streams, blurry images, and their corresponding sharp sequences. We subsequently develop a self-supervised cascaded framework to alleviate the issues of spike noise and spatial-resolution mismatching encountered in the deblurring model. With knowledge distillation and re-blurring loss, we further design a lightweight deblur network to generate high-quality sequences with brightness and texture consistency with the original input. Quantitative and qualitative experiments conducted on our real-world and synthetic datasets with spikes validate the superior generalization of the proposed framework. Our code, data and trained models will be available at \url{https://github.com/chenkang455/S-SDM}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS24</p></details> |

This massive upscaling motivates a departure from univariate wind forecasting methods that traditionally focused on a single representative height. To fill this gap, we propose DeepMIDE--a statistical deep learning method which jointly models the offshore wind speeds across space, time, and height. DeepMIDE is formulated as a multi-output integro-difference equation model with a multivariate, nonstationary, and state-dependent kernel characterized by a set of advection vectors that encode the physics of wind field formation and propagation. Embedded within DeepMIDE, an advanced deep learning architecture learns these advection vectors from high dimensional streams of exogenous weather information, which, along with other parameters, are plugged back into the statistical model for probabilistic multi-height space-time forecasting. Tested on real-world data from future offshore wind energy sites in the Northeastern United States, the wind speed and power forecasts from DeepMIDE are shown to outperform those from prevalent time series, spatio-temporal, and deep learning methods.</p></details> |  |

Computations are done through a Gaussian Markov random field approximation of the solution of the SPDE, which is constructed through a finite volume method. The new flexible non-separable model is compared to a flexible separable model both for reconstruction and forecasting, and evaluated in terms of root mean square errors and continuous rank probability scores. A simulation study demonstrates that the non-separable model performs better when the data is simulated from a non-separable model with diffusion and advection. Further, we estimate surrogate models for emulating the output of a ocean model in Trondheimsfjorden, Norway, and simulate observations of autonomous underwater vehicles. The results show that the flexible non-separable model outperforms the flexible separable model for real-time prediction of unobserved locations.</p></details> |  |

| **[Multi-modal Motion Prediction using Temporal Ensembling with Learning-based Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19606v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen a shift towards learning-based methods for trajectory prediction, with challenges remaining in addressing uncertainty and capturing multi-modal distributions. This paper introduces Temporal Ensembling with Learning-based Aggregation, a meta-algorithm designed to mitigate the issue of missing behaviors in trajectory prediction, which leads to inconsistent predictions across consecutive frames. Unlike conventional model ensembling, temporal ensembling leverages predictions from nearby frames to enhance spatial coverage and prediction diversity. By confirming predictions from multiple frames, temporal ensembling compensates for occasional errors in individual frame predictions. Furthermore, trajectory-level aggregation, often utilized in model ensembling, is insufficient for temporal ensembling due to a lack of consideration of traffic context and its tendency to assign candidate trajectories with incorrect driving behaviors to final predictions. We further emphasize the necessity of learning-based aggregation by utilizing mode queries within a DETR-like architecture for our temporal ensembling, leveraging the characteristics of predictions from nearby frames. Our method, validated on the Argoverse 2 dataset, shows notable improvements: a 4% reduction in minADE, a 5% decrease in minFDE, and a 1.16% reduction in the miss rate compared to the strongest baseline, QCNet, highlighting its efficacy and potential in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024), accepted by IROS2024</p></details> |

While remote sensing data is abundant, existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to capture temporal dynamics effectively.

Using fine-tuning techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), quantized LoRA (QLoRA), and model pruning on models such as Video-LLaVA and LLaVA-NeXT-Video, we significantly enhance VLM performance in processing remote sensing temporal changes. Results show significant improvements, with the best performance achieving a BERT score of 0.864 and ROUGE-1 score of 0.576, demonstrating superior accuracy in describing land-use transformations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

They have appeared in various real-world scenarios such as social media, financial transactions, and healthcare records, and have been effectively modeled through Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) models. Recently, developing generative models for these MTPP models have seen rapid development due to their powerful generative capability and less restrictive functional forms. However, existing generative MTPP models are usually challenged in jointly modeling events' timestamps and types since: (1) mainstream methods design the generative mechanisms for timestamps only and do not include event types; (2) the complex interdependence between the timestamps and event types are overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel generative MTPP model called BMTPP. Unlike existing generative MTPP models, BMTPP flexibly models marked temporal joint distributions using a parameter-based approach. Additionally, by adding joint noise to the marked temporal data space, BMTPP effectively captures and explicitly reveals the interdependence between timestamps and event types. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art models and its ability to effectively capture marked-temporal interdependence.</p></details> |  |

We explore the relationships between sequential, iterative, and optimal combination approaches, and discuss the conditions under which a sequential reconciliation approach (either first-cross-sectional-then-temporal, or first-temporal-then-cross-sectional) is equivalent to a fully (i.e., cross-temporally) coherent iterative heuristic. Furthermore, we show that for specific patterns of the error covariance matrix in the regression model on which the optimal combination approach grounds, iterative reconciliation naturally converges to the optimal combination solution, regardless the order of application of the uni-dimensional cross-sectional and temporal reconciliation approaches. Theoretical and empirical properties of the proposed approaches are investigated through a forecasting experiment using a dataset of hourly photovoltaic power generation. The study presents a comprehensive framework for understanding and enhancing cross-temporal forecast reconciliation, considering both forecast accuracy and the often overlooked computational aspects, showing that significant improvement can be achieved in terms of memory space and computation time, two particularly important aspects in the high-dimensional contexts that usually arise in cross-temporal forecast reconciliation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ST-NeRP: Spatial-Temporal Neural Representation Learning with Prior Embedding for Patient-specific Imaging Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19283v1)** | 2024-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During and after a course of therapy, imaging is routinely used to monitor the disease progression and assess the treatment responses. Despite of its significance, reliably capturing and predicting the spatial-temporal anatomic changes from a sequence of patient-specific image series presents a considerable challenge. Thus, the development of a computational framework becomes highly desirable for a multitude of practical applications. In this context, we propose a strategy of Spatial-Temporal Neural Representation learning with Prior embedding (ST-NeRP) for patient-specific imaging study. Our strategy involves leveraging an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) network to encode the image at the reference time point into a prior embedding. Subsequently, a spatial-temporally continuous deformation function is learned through another INR network. This network is trained using the whole patient-specific image sequence, enabling the prediction of deformation fields at various target time points. The efficacy of the ST-NeRP model is demonstrated through its application to diverse sequential image series, including 4D CT and longitudinal CT datasets within thoracic and abdominal imaging. The proposed ST-NeRP model exhibits substantial potential in enabling the monitoring of anatomical changes within a patient throughout the therapeutic journey.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages with 10 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Modulated Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators for Temporal Interpolation of Weather Forecasts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18904v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weather and climate data are often available at limited temporal resolution, either due to storage limitations, or in the case of weather forecast models based on deep learning, their inherently long time steps. The coarse temporal resolution makes it difficult to capture rapidly evolving weather events. To address this limitation, we introduce an interpolation model that reconstructs the atmospheric state between two points in time for which the state is known. The model makes use of a novel network layer that modifies the adaptive Fourier neural operator (AFNO), which has been previously used in weather prediction and other applications of machine learning to physics problems. The modulated AFNO (ModAFNO) layer takes an embedding, here computed from the interpolation target time, as an additional input and applies a learned shift-scale operation inside the AFNO layers to adapt them to the target time. Thus, one model can be used to produce all intermediate time steps. Trained to interpolate between two time steps 6 h apart, the ModAFNO-based interpolation model produces 1 h resolution intermediate time steps that are visually nearly indistinguishable from the actual corresponding 1 h resolution data. The model reduces the RMSE loss of reconstructing the intermediate steps by approximately 50% compared to linear interpolation. We also demonstrate its ability to reproduce the statistics of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and heat waves better than 6 h resolution data. The ModAFNO layer is generic and is expected to be applicable to other problems, including weather forecasting with tunable lead time.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Spatial-Temporal Search for Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18580v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are considered as a potential candidate for the next generation of artificial intelligence with appealing characteristics such as sparse computation and inherent temporal dynamics. By adopting architectures of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), SNNs achieve competitive performances on benchmark tasks like image classification. However, successful architectures of ANNs are not optimal for SNNs. In this work, we apply Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find suitable architectures for SNNs. Previous NAS methods for SNNs focus primarily on the spatial dimension, with a notable lack of consideration for the temporal dynamics that are of critical importance for SNNs. Drawing inspiration from the heterogeneity of biological neural networks, we propose a differentiable approach to optimize SNN on both spatial and temporal dimensions. At spatial level, we have developed a spike-based differentiable hierarchical search (SpikeDHS) framework, where spike-based operation is optimized on both the cell and the layer level under computational constraints. We further propose a differentiable surrogate gradient search (DGS) method to evolve local SG functions independently during training. At temporal level, we explore an optimal configuration of diverse temporal dynamics on different types of spiking neurons by evolving their time constants, based on which we further develop hybrid networks combining SNN and ANN, balancing both accuracy and efficiency. Our methods achieve comparable classification performance of CIFAR10/100 and ImageNet with accuracies of 96.43%, 78.96%, and 70.21%, respectively. On event-based deep stereo, our methods find optimal layer variation and surpass the accuracy of specially designed ANNs with 26$\times$ lower computational cost ($6.7\mathrm{mJ}$), demonstrating the potential of SNN in processing highly sparse and dynamic signals.</p></details> |  |

Analysing political speech data from more than 30 years requires the use of flexible topic models to uncover the latent topics and their change in prevalence over time as well as the change in the vocabulary of the topics. We propose the temporal Poisson factorisation (TPF) model as an extension to the Poisson factorisation model to model sparse count data matrices obtained based on the bag-of-words assumption from text documents with time stamps. We discuss and empirically compare different model specifications for the time-varying latent variables consisting either of a flexible auto-regressive structure of order one or a random walk. Estimation is based on variational inference where we consider a combination of coordinate ascent updates with automatic differentiation using batching of documents. Suitable variational families are proposed to ease inference. We compare results obtained using independent univariate variational distributions for the time-varying latent variables to those obtained with a multivariate variant.

| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively. The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p></details> |  |
| **[NEOviz: Uncertainty-Driven Visual Analysis of Asteroid Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02812v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce NEOviz, an interactive visualization system designed to assist planetary defense experts in the visual analysis of the movements of near-Earth objects in the Solar System that might prove hazardous to Earth. Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

| **[Intrinsic Dimensionality of Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou High-Dimensional Trajectories Through Manifold Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02058v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A data-driven approach based on unsupervised machine learning is proposed to infer the intrinsic dimensions $m^{\ast}$ of the high-dimensional trajectories of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model. Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Enhancing Social Robot Navigation with Integrated Motion Prediction and Trajectory Planning in Dynamic Human Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01814v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigating safely in dynamic human environments is crucial for mobile service robots, and social navigation is a key aspect of this process. In this paper, we proposed an integrative approach that combines motion prediction and trajectory planning to enable safe and socially-aware robot navigation. The main idea of the proposed method is to leverage the advantages of Socially Acceptable trajectory prediction and Timed Elastic Band (TEB) by incorporating human interactive information including position, orientation, and motion into the objective function of the TEB algorithms. In addition, we designed social constraints to ensure the safety of robot navigation. The proposed system is evaluated through physical simulation using both quantitative and qualitative metrics, demonstrating its superior performance in avoiding human and dynamic obstacles, thereby ensuring safe navigation.

| **[GTA: Generative Trajectory Augmentation with Guidance for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16907v4)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) presents challenges of learning effective decision-making policies from static datasets without any online interactions. Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

| **[Estimating Generalization Performance Along the Trajectory of Proximal SGD in Robust Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02629v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the generalization performance of iterates obtained by Gradient Descent (GD), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and their proximal variants in high-dimensional robust regression problems. The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |
| **[Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Safe Motion Planning in Autonomous Driving: A Transformer-Transfer Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01475v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical aspect of safe and efficient motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is to handle the complex and uncertain behavior of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

The paper [13] discussed two frameworks for multitarget trajectory representation--labeled random finite set (LRFS) and set of trajectories (SoT)--and the merging of SoT and PMBM into trajectory PMBM (TPMBM) theory. This paper summarizes and augments the main findings of [12], [13]--specifcally, why SoT, PMBM, and TPMBM are physically and mathematically erroneous.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figur4e |
| **[TrajRoute: Rethinking Routing with a Simple Trajectory-Based Approach -- Forget the Maps and Traffic!](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01325v1)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The abundance of vehicle trajectory data offers a new opportunity to compute driving routes between origins and destinations. Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[GPTR: Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation for Continuous-Time Motion Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22931v3)** | 2024-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous-time trajectory representation has gained significant popularity in recent years, as it offers an elegant formulation that allows the fusion of a larger number of sensors and sensing modalities, overcoming limitations of traditional discrete-time frameworks. To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

The base transcription algorithm for which we establish the refinement algorithm is a direct multiple shooting technique -- QuITO v.2 (Quasi-Interpolation based Trajectory Optimization). The mesh refinement technique consists of two steps -- localization of certain irregular regions in an optimal control trajectory via wavelets, followed by a targeted $h$-refinement approach around such regions of irregularity. Theoretical approximation guarantees on uniform grids are presented for optimal controls with certain regularity properties, along with guarantees of localization of change points by wavelet transform. Numerical illustrations are provided for control profiles involving discontinuities to show the effectiveness of the localization and refinement strategy. We also announce, and make freely available, a new software package based on QuITO v.2 along with all its functionalities for completeness.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |
| **[Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction with Missing Data: Datasets, Imputation, and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00174v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pedestrian trajectory prediction is crucial for several applications such as robotics and self-driving vehicles. Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications.

| **[Conformalized Prediction of Post-Fault Voltage Trajectories Using Pre-trained and Finetuned Attention-Driven Neural Operators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24162v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a new data-driven methodology for predicting intervals of post-fault voltage trajectories in power systems. We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios. To further evaluate on vehicle-to-everything (V2X) scenario, we construct the first real-world V2X motion forecasting dataset V2X-Traj, which contains multiple autonomous vehicles and infrastructure in every scenario. Experimental results on both V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj show the advantage of our method. We hope both V2X-Graph and V2X-Traj will benefit the further development of cooperative motion forecasting.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

DisCo is a distributed contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithm, which allows a group of robots to optimize a time sequence of forces to objects and to their environment to accomplish tasks such as collaborative manipulation, robot team sports, and modular robot locomotion. We build our algorithm on a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), where each robot computes its own contact forces and contact-switching events from a smaller single-robot, contact-implicit trajectory optimization problem, while cooperating with other robots through dual variables, enforcing constraints between robots. Each robot iterates between solving its local problem, and communicating over a wireless mesh network to enforce these consistency constraints with its neighbors, ultimately converging to a coordinated plan for the group. The local problems solved by each robot are significantly less challenging than a centralized problem with all robots' contact forces and switching events, improving the computational efficiency, while also preserving the privacy of some aspects of each robot's operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulations of collaborative manipulation, multi-robot team sports scenarios, and in modular robot locomotion, where DisCo achieves $3$x higher success rates with a 2.5x to 5x faster computation time. Further, we provide results of hardware experiments on a modular truss robot, with three collaborating truss nodes planning individually while working together to produce a punctuated rolling-gate motion of the composite structure.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

By combining sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control with gradient-based Interior-Point Differential Dynamic Programming (IPDDP), we leverage their respective strengths in exploration and smoothing. The proposed method, MPPI-IPDDP, involves three steps: First, MPPI control is used to generate a coarse trajectory. Second, a collision-free convex corridor is constructed. Third, IPDDP is applied to smooth the coarse trajectory, utilizing the collision-free corridor from the second step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the proposed algorithm to trajectory optimization for differential-drive wheeled mobile robots and point-mass quadrotors. In comparisons with other MPPI variants and continuous optimization-based solvers, our method shows superior performance in terms of computational robustness and trajectory smoothness.

| **[Choice between Partial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities to be determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of human preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

LCGA summarizes similar patterns of change over time into a few distinct categories called trajectory groups, which are then included as "treatments" in the MSM. MSMs are a class of causal models that correctly handle treatment-confounder feedback. The parameters of LCGA-MSMs can be consistently estimated using different estimators, such as inverse probability weighting (IPW), g-computation, and pooled longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (pooled LTMLE). These three estimators of the parameters of LCGA-MSMs are currently implemented in our package. In the context of a time-dependent outcome, we previously proposed a combination of LCGA and history-restricted MSMs (LCGA-HRMSMs). Our package provides additional functions to estimate the parameters of such models.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a method for the learning of the recovery trajectory of an individual patient, as they undertake exercises as part of their physical therapy towards recovery of their loss of movement ability, following a critical illness. The difference between the Movement Recovery Scores (MRSs) attained by a patient, when undertaking a given exercise routine on successive instances, is given by a statistical distance/divergence between the (posterior) probabilities of random graphs that are Bayesianly learnt using time series data on locations of 20 of the patient's joints, recorded on an e-platform as the patient exercises. This allows for the computation of the MRS on every occasion the patient undertakes this exercise, using which, the recovery trajectory is drawn. We learn each graph as a Random Geometric Graph drawn in a probabilistic metric space, and identify the closed-form marginal posterior of any edge of the graph, given the correlation structure of the multivariate time series data on joint locations. On the basis of our recovery learning, we offer recommendations on the optimal exercise routines for patients with given level of mobility impairment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a strategy to locally adapt the step size parameter of HMC at every iteration by evaluating a low-rank approximation of the local Hessian and estimating its largest eigenvalue. We combine it with a strategy to similarly adapt the trajectory length by monitoring the no U-turn condition, resulting in an adaptive sampler, ATLAS: adapting trajectory length and step-size. We further use a delayed rejection framework for making multiple proposals that improves the computational efficiency of ATLAS, and develop an approach for automatically tuning its hyperparameters during warmup. We compare ATLAS with state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS on a suite of synthetic and real world examples, and show that i) unlike NUTS, ATLAS is able to accurately sample difficult distributions with complex geometries, ii) it is computationally competitive to NUTS for simpler distributions, and iii) it is more robust to the tuning of hyperparamters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/modichirag/AtlasSampler</p></details> |

Neural stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and uncertainty prediction.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Combining Deep Reinforcement Learning with a Jerk-Bounded Trajectory Generator for Kinematically Constrained Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20907v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is emerging as a promising method for adaptive robotic motion and complex task automation, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional control methods. However, ensuring safety throughout both the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to the risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of actions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a continuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions, causing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with a jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control strategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of robotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of DRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth, continuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions. The framework also includes pre-calculated safe velocity zones for smooth braking, preventing joint limit violations and ensuring compliance with kinematic constraints. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and safety of the robotic system but also optimizes motion control, making it suitable for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to a highly complex heavy-duty manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE for potential publication</p></details> |

Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

Numerous methods have been proposed to address specific problems within trajectory modelling. However, due to the heterogeneity of data and the diversity of trajectory tasks, achieving unified trajectory modelling remains an important yet challenging task. In this paper, we propose TrajAgent, a large language model-based agentic framework, to unify various trajectory modelling tasks.

Building on UniEnv, we introduce TAgent, an agentic workflow designed for automatic trajectory modelling across various trajectory tasks. Specifically, we design AutOpt, a systematic optimization module within TAgent, to further improve the performance of the integrated model. With diverse trajectory tasks input in natural language, TrajAgent automatically generates competitive results via training and executing appropriate models.

Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

| **[Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Historical Trajectory Assisted Optimization Method for Zeroth-Order Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15955v5)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning heavily relies on distributed gradient descent techniques. In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000 trajectories dataset and a ROS 2 package to facilitate the integration with existing ROS-based UAV systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods.

| **[FreeVS: Generative View Synthesis on Free Driving Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18079v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reconstruction-based novel view synthesis methods for driving scenes focus on synthesizing camera views along the recorded trajectory of the ego vehicle. Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories.

| **[Enhancing Interaction Modeling with Agent Selection and Physical Coefficient for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13152v3)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A thorough understanding of the interaction between the target agent and surrounding agents is a prerequisite for accurate trajectory prediction. Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ackno...</summary><p>acknowledgement added</p></details> |

For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6(+1)...</summary><p>6(+1) pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cooperative Trajectory Planning: Principles for Human-Machine System Design on Trajectory Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16938v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores cooperative trajectory planning approaches within the context of human-machine shared control. In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

| **[Influential Language Data Selection via Gradient Trajectory Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16710v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Time Warping-based imputation of long gaps in human mobility trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16096v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual mobility trajectories are difficult to measure and often incur long periods of missingness. Aggregation of this mobility data without accounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating travel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple Imputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility trajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This method reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel behavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the dynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series preceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes values multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal parameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods are applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with simulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling missingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when gaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps become longer and when more data are available.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

In practice, different driving scenarios present varying levels of difficulty for trajectory prediction models. However, most existing research focuses on the average precision of prediction results, while ignoring the underlying distribution of the input scenarios. This paper proposes a critical example mining method that utilizes a data-driven approach to estimate the rareness of the trajectories. By combining the rareness estimation of observations with whole trajectories, the proposed method effectively identifies a subset of data that is relatively hard to predict BEFORE feeding them to a specific prediction model. The experimental results show that the mined subset has higher prediction error when applied to different downstream prediction models, which reaches +108.1% error (greater than two times compared to the average on dataset) when mining 5% samples. Further analysis indicates that the mined critical examples include uncommon cases such as sudden brake and cancelled lane-change, which helps to better understand and improve the performance of prediction models.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |
| **[FlickerFusion: Intra-trajectory Domain Generalizing Multi-Agent RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15876v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing complex cooperative tasks across various real-world applications. However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. Our results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. For standardized evaluation, we introduce MPEv2, an enhanced version of Multi Particle Environments (MPE), consisting of 12 benchmarks. Benchmarks, implementations, and trained models are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. The results demonstrated the significant superiority of the proposed methods over the baselines in terms of the closed-loop metrics.

The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We propose a semi-decentralized planner for the vehicles to seek VE-based fair trajectories, which can significantly improve computational efficiency through parallel computing among CAVs and enhance the safety of planned trajectories by ensuring equilibrium concordance among CAVs. Finally, experimental results show the advantages of the approach, including fast computation speed, high scalability, equilibrium concordance, and safety.</p></details> |  |

The driving risk can be quantified as the product of the probability that an event (such as collision) will occur and the consequence of that event. However, the probability of events occurring is often difficult to predict due to the uncertainty of drivers' or vehicles' behavior. Traditional methods generally employ kinematic-based approaches to predict the future trajectories of entities, which often yield unrealistic prediction results. In this paper, the Enhanced Driving Risk Field (EDRF) model is proposed, integrating deep learning-based multimodal trajectory prediction results with Gaussian distribution models to quantitatively capture the uncertainty of traffic entities' behavior. The applications of the EDRF are also proposed. It is applied across various tasks (traffic risk monitoring, ego-vehicle risk analysis, and motion and trajectory planning) through the defined concept Interaction Risk (IR). Adequate example scenarios are provided for each application to illustrate the effectiveness of the model.</p></details> |  |

Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |

The core idea is to train an encoder to transform trajectories into representation vectors and then compute vector similarity to approximate the ground truth. However, existing methods face dual challenges of effectiveness and efficiency: 1) they all utilize Euclidean distance to compute representation similarity, which leads to the severe curse of dimensionality issue -- reducing the distinguishability among representations and significantly affecting the accuracy of subsequent similarity search tasks; 2) most of them are trained in triplets manner and often necessitate additional information which downgrades the efficiency; 3) previous studies, while emphasizing the scalability in terms of efficiency, overlooked the deterioration of effectiveness when the dataset size grows. To cope with these issues, we propose a simple, yet accurate, fast, scalable model that only uses a single-layer vanilla transformer encoder as the feature extractor and employs tailored representation similarity functions to approximate various ground truth similarity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly mitigates the curse of dimensionality issue and outperforms the state-of-the-arts in effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |

Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks.

| **[PTR: A Pre-trained Language Model for Trajectory Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is vital for web-of-things services and is extensively collected and analyzed by web-based hardware and platforms. However, issues such as service interruptions and network instability often lead to sparsely recorded trajectories, resulting in a loss of detailed movement data. As a result, recovering these trajectories to restore missing information becomes essential. Despite progress, several challenges remain unresolved. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data hampers the performance of existing deep learning methods, which rely heavily on abundant data for supervised training. Second, current methods struggle to generalize across sparse trajectories with varying sampling intervals, necessitating separate re-training for each interval and increasing computational costs. Third, external factors crucial for the recovery of missing points are not fully incorporated. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called PTR. This framework mitigates the issue of limited dense trajectory data by leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs). PTR incorporates an explicit trajectory prompt and is trained on datasets with multiple sampling intervals, enabling it to generalize effectively across different intervals in sparse trajectories. To capture external factors, we introduce an implicit trajectory prompt that models road conditions, providing richer information for recovering missing points. Additionally, we present a trajectory embedder that encodes trajectory points and transforms the embeddings of both observed and missing points into a format comprehensible to PLMs. Experimental results on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of PTR.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically rely on trajectories from a single spatial view, limiting their ability to capture the rich contextual information that is crucial for gaining deeper insights into movement patterns across different geospatial contexts. To this end, we propose MVTraj, a novel multi-view modeling method for trajectory representation learning. MVTraj integrates diverse contextual knowledge, from GPS to road network and points-of-interest to provide a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory data. To align the learning process across multiple views, we utilize GPS trajectories as a bridge and employ self-supervised pretext tasks to capture and distinguish movement patterns across different spatial views. Following this, we treat trajectories from different views as distinct modalities and apply a hierarchical cross-modal interaction module to fuse the representations, thereby enriching the knowledge derived from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MVTraj significantly outperforms existing baselines in tasks associated with various spatial views, validating its effectiveness and practical utility in spatio-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  |

Current air traffic control systems fail to consider spoken instructions for traffic prediction, bringing significant challenges in detecting human errors during real-time traffic operations. Here, we present an automation paradigm integrating controlling intent into the information processing loop through the spoken instruction-aware flight trajectory prediction framework. A 3-stage progressive multi-modal learning paradigm is proposed to address the modality gap between the trajectory and spoken instructions, as well as minimize the data requirements. Experiments on a real-world dataset show the proposed framework achieves flight trajectory prediction with high predictability and timeliness, obtaining over 20% relative reduction in mean deviation error. Moreover, the generalizability of the proposed framework is also confirmed by various model architectures. The proposed framework can formulate full-automated information processing in real-world air traffic applications, supporting human error detection and enhancing aviation safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in principle by Nature Communications</p></details> |
| **[Latent Weight Diffusion: Generating Policies from Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14040v1)** | 2024-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of open-source robotic data, imitation learning has emerged as a viable approach for both robot manipulation and locomotion. Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic tasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration trajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a hypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to learn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors of the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the benefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires fewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD achieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while using models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD generates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in long action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are difficult to realize safe navigation, considering uncertainties, complex environmental structures, and robot swarms. This paper introduces an extended state model predictive control planner with a safe probability field to address the multi-robot navigation problem in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. Initially, the safe probability field offers an innovative approach to model the uncertainty of external dynamic obstacles, combining it with an unconstrained optimization method to generate safe trajectories for multi-robot online. Subsequently, the extended state model predictive controller can accurately track these generated trajectories while considering the robots' inherent model constraints and state uncertainty, thus ensuring the practical feasibility of the planned trajectories. Simulation experiments show a success rate four times higher than that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Physical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to operate in real-time, enabling safe navigation for multi-robot in uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |

| **[Revisiting CNNs for Trajectory Similarity Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19761v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Similarity search is a fundamental but expensive operator in querying trajectory data, due to its quadratic complexity of distance computation. To mitigate the computational burden for long trajectories, neural networks have been widely employed for similarity learning and each trajectory is encoded as a high-dimensional vector for similarity search with linear complexity. Given the sequential nature of trajectory data, previous efforts have been primarily devoted to the utilization of RNNs or Transformers. In this paper, we argue that the common practice of treating trajectory as sequential data results in excessive attention to capturing long-term global dependency between two sequences. Instead, our investigation reveals the pivotal role of local similarity, prompting a revisit of simple CNNs for trajectory similarity learning. We introduce ConvTraj, incorporating both 1D and 2D convolutions to capture sequential and geo-distribution features of trajectories, respectively. In addition, we conduct a series of theoretical analyses to justify the effectiveness of ConvTraj. Experimental results on four real-world large-scale datasets demonstrate that ConvTraj achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in trajectory similarity search. Owing to the simple network structure of ConvTraj, the training and inference speed on the Porto dataset with 1.6 million trajectories are increased by at least $240$x and $2.16$x, respectively. The source code and dataset can be found at \textit{\url{https://github.com/Proudc/ConvTraj}}.</p></details> |  |

Asteroids are often discovered using optical telescopes and their trajectories are calculated from images, resulting in an inherent asymmetric uncertainty in their position and velocity. Consequently, we typically cannot determine the exact trajectory of an asteroid, and an ensemble of trajectories must be generated to estimate an asteroid's movement over time. When propagating these ensembles over decades, it is challenging to visualize the varying paths and determine their potential impact on Earth, which could cause catastrophic damage. NEOviz equips experts with the necessary tools to effectively analyze the existing catalog of asteroid observations. In particular, we present a novel approach for visualizing the 3D uncertainty region through which an asteroid travels, while providing accurate spatial context in relation to system-critical infrastructure such as Earth, the Moon, and artificial satellites. Furthermore, we use NEOviz to visualize the divergence of asteroid trajectories, capturing high-variance events in an asteroid's orbital properties. For potential impactors, we combine the 3D visualization with an uncertainty-aware impact map to illustrate the potential risks to human populations. NEOviz was developed with continuous input from members of the planetary defense community through a participatory design process. It is exemplified in three real-world use cases and evaluated via expert feedback interviews.</p></details> |  |

We employ state-of-the-art computer vision and deep learning to create an end-to-end pipeline that enhances vehicle detection, tracking, and trajectory stabilization. Conducted in the Songdo International Business District, South Korea, the study used a multi-drone experiment over 20 intersections, capturing approximately 12TB of 4K video data over four days. We developed a novel track stabilization method that uses detected vehicle bounding boxes as exclusion masks during image registration, which, combined with advanced georeferencing techniques, accurately transforms vehicle coordinates into real-world geographical data. Additionally, our framework includes robust vehicle dimension estimation and detailed road segmentation for in-depth traffic analysis. The framework produced two high-quality datasets: the Songdo Traffic dataset, comprising nearly 1 million unique vehicle trajectories, and the Songdo Vision dataset, containing over 5,000 human-annotated frames with about 300,000 vehicle instances in four classes. Comparisons between drone-derived data and high-precision sensor data from an instrumented probe vehicle highlight the accuracy and consistency of our framework's extraction in dense urban settings. By publicly releasing these datasets and the pipeline source code, this work sets new benchmarks for data quality, reproducibility, and scalability in traffic research. Results demonstrate the potential of integrating drone technology with advanced computer vision for precise, cost-effective urban traffic monitoring, providing valuable resources for the research community to develop intelligent transportation systems and improve traffic management strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyper-SD: Trajectory Segmented Consistency Model for Efficient Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13686v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose Hyper-SD, a novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by +0.68 in CLIP Score and +0.51 in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024 (Camera-Ready Version).

Principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to trajectory data consisting of $n_s = 4,000,000$ datapoints, of the FPUT $\beta$ model with $N = 32$ coupled oscillators, revealing a critical relationship between $m^{\ast}$ and the model's nonlinear strength. For weak nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \ll n$, where $n = 2N$. In contrast, for strong nonlinearities, $m^{\ast} \rightarrow n - 1$, consistently with the ergodic hypothesis. Furthermore, one of the potential limitations of PCA is addressed through an analysis with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding ($t$-SNE). Accordingly, we found strong evidence suggesting that the datapoints lie near or on a curved low-dimensional manifold for weak nonlinearities.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 figures |

Data augmentation techniques, such as noise injection and data synthesizing, aim to improve Q-function approximation by smoothing the learned state-action region. However, these methods often fall short of directly improving the quality of offline datasets, leading to suboptimal results. In response, we introduce GTA, Generative Trajectory Augmentation, a novel generative data augmentation approach designed to enrich offline data by augmenting trajectories to be both high-rewarding and dynamically plausible. GTA applies a diffusion model within the data augmentation framework. GTA partially noises original trajectories and then denoises them with classifier-free guidance via conditioning on amplified return value. Our results show that GTA, as a general data augmentation strategy, enhances the performance of widely used offline RL algorithms across various tasks with unique challenges. Furthermore, we conduct a quality analysis of data augmented by GTA and demonstrate that GTA improves the quality of the data.

The number of features is comparable to the sample size and errors may be heavy-tailed. We introduce estimators that precisely track the generalization error of the iterates along the trajectory of the iterative algorithm. These estimators are provably consistent under suitable conditions. The results are illustrated through several examples, including Huber regression, pseudo-Huber regression, and their penalized variants with non-smooth regularizer. We provide explicit generalization error estimates for iterates generated from GD and SGD, or from proximal SGD in the presence of a non-smooth regularizer. The proposed risk estimates serve as effective proxies for the actual generalization error, allowing us to determine the optimal stopping iteration that minimizes the generalization error. Extensive simulations confirm the effectiveness of the proposed generalization error estimates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of NeurIPS 2024 paper</p></details> |
| **[Interaction-Aware Trajectory Prediction for Safe Motion Planning in Autonomous Driving: A Transformer-Transfer Learning Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01475v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A critical aspect of safe and efficient motion planning for autonomous vehicles (AVs) is to handle the complex and uncertain behavior of surrounding human-driven vehicles (HDVs). Despite intensive research on driver behavior prediction, existing approaches typically overlook the interactions between AVs and HDVs assuming that HDV trajectories are not affected by AV actions. To address this gap, we present a transformer-transfer learning-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor for safe motion planning of autonomous driving, focusing on a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) interaction scenario consisting of an AV and an HDV. Specifically, we construct a transformer-based interaction-aware trajectory predictor using widely available datasets of HDV trajectory data and further transfer the learned predictor using a small set of AV-HDV interaction data. Then, to better incorporate the proposed trajectory predictor into the motion planning module of AVs, we introduce an uncertainty quantification method to characterize the errors of the predictor, which are integrated into the path-planning process. Our experimental results demonstrate the value of explicitly considering interactions and handling uncertainties.</p></details> |  |

Current graph-based routing pipelines, while effective, involve substantial costs in constructing, maintaining, and updating road network graphs to reflect real-time conditions. In this study, we propose a new trajectory-based routing paradigm that bypasses current workflows by directly utilizing raw trajectory data to compute efficient routes. Our method, named TrajRoute, uniquely "follows" historical trajectories from a source to a destination, constructing paths that reflect actual driver behavior and implicit preferences. To supplement areas with sparse trajectory data, the road network is also incorporated into TrajRoute's index, and tunable parameters are introduced to control the balance between road segments and trajectories, ensuring a unified and adaptable routing approach. We experimentally verify our approach by comparing it to an existing online routing service. Our results demonstrate that as the number of trajectories covering the road network increases, TrajRoute produces increasingly accurate travel time and route length estimates while gradually eliminating the need to downgrade to the road network. This highlights the potential of simpler, data-driven pipelines for routing, offering lower-maintenance alternatives to conventional systems.</p></details> |  |

To bolster the adoption of the continuous-time paradigm, we propose a so-called Gaussian Process Trajectory Representation (GPTR) framework for continuous-time motion estimation (CTME) tasks. Our approach stands out by employing a third-order random jerk model, featuring closed-form expressions for both rotational and translational state derivatives. This model provides smooth, continuous trajectory representations that are crucial for precise estimation of complex motion. To support the wider robotics and computer vision communities, we have made the source code for GPTR available as a light-weight header-only library. This format was chosen for its ease of integration, allowing developers to incorporate GPTR into existing systems without needing extensive code modifications. Moreover, we also provide a set of optimization examples with LiDAR, camera, IMU, UWB factors, and closed-form analytical Jacobians under the proposed GP framework. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of GP-based trajectory representation in various motion estimation tasks, and the examples can serve as the prototype to help researchers quickly develop future applications such as batch optimization, calibration, sensor fusion, trajectory planning, etc., with continuous-time trajectory representation.

The key idea is to capture each task by an object-centric representation, specifically the SE(3) object pose trajectory relative to the target. This approach decouples embodiment actions from sensory inputs, facilitating learning from various demonstration types, including both action-based and action-less human hand demonstrations, as well as cross-embodiment generalization. Additionally, object pose trajectories inherently capture planning constraints from demonstrations without the need for manually crafted rules. To guide the robot in executing the task, the object trajectory is used to condition a diffusion policy. We show improvement compared to prior work on RLBench simulated tasks. In real-world evaluation, using only eight demonstrations shot on an iPhone, our approach completed all tasks while fully complying with task constraints.

At the heart of RopeTP is a hierarchical attention mechanism that significantly improves context awareness, which is essential for accurately inferring the posture of occluded body parts. This is achieved by exploiting the relationships with visible anatomical structures, enhancing the accuracy of local pose estimations. The improved robustness of these local estimations allows for the reconstruction of precise and stable global trajectories. Additionally, RopeTP incorporates a diffusion trajectory model that predicts realistic human motion from local pose sequences. This model ensures that the generated trajectories are not only consistent with observed local actions but also unfold naturally over time, thereby improving the realism and stability of 3D human motion reconstruction. Extensive experimental validation shows that RopeTP surpasses current methods on two benchmark datasets, particularly excelling in scenarios with occlusions. It also outperforms methods that rely on SLAM for initial camera estimates and extensive optimization, delivering more accurate and realistic trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2025 (Round 1)</p></details> |

Significant progress has been made in the past decade thanks to the availability of pedestrian trajectory datasets, which enable trajectory prediction methods to learn from pedestrians' past movements and predict future trajectories. However, these datasets and methods typically assume that the observed trajectory sequence is complete, ignoring real-world issues such as sensor failure, occlusion, and limited fields of view that can result in missing values in observed trajectories. To address this challenge, we present TrajImpute, a pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset that simulates missing coordinates in the observed trajectory, enhancing real-world applicability. TrajImpute maintains a uniform distribution of missing data within the observed trajectories. In this work, we comprehensively examine several imputation methods to reconstruct the missing coordinates and benchmark them for imputing pedestrian trajectories. Furthermore, we provide a thorough analysis of recent trajectory prediction methods and evaluate the performance of these models on the imputed trajectories. Our experimental evaluation of the imputation and trajectory prediction methods offers several valuable insights. Our dataset provides a foundational resource for future research on imputation-aware pedestrian trajectory prediction, potentially accelerating the deployment of these methods in real-world applications.

We begin by introducing the Quantile Attention-Fourier Deep Operator Network (QAF-DeepONet), designed to capture the complex dynamics of voltage trajectories and reliably estimate quantiles of the target trajectory without any distributional assumptions. The proposed operator regression model maps the observed portion of the voltage trajectory to its unobserved post-fault trajectory. Our methodology employs a pre-training and fine-tuning process to address the challenge of limited data availability. To ensure data privacy in learning the pre-trained model, we use merging via federated learning with data from neighboring buses, enabling the model to learn the underlying voltage dynamics from such buses without directly sharing their data. After pre-training, we fine-tune the model with data from the target bus, allowing it to adapt to unique dynamics and operating conditions. Finally, we integrate conformal prediction into the fine-tuned model to ensure coverage guarantees for the predicted intervals. We evaluated the performance of the proposed methodology using the New England 39-bus test system considering detailed models of voltage and frequency controllers. Two metrics, Prediction Interval Coverage Probability (PICP) and Prediction Interval Normalized Average Width (PINAW), are used to numerically assess the model's performance in predicting intervals. The results show that the proposed approach offers practical and reliable uncertainty quantification in predicting the interval of post-fault voltage trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Existing research mainly focuses on leveraging single-frame cooperative information to enhance the limited perception capability of the ego vehicle, while underutilizing the motion and interaction context of traffic participants observed from cooperative devices. In this paper, we propose a forecasting-oriented representation paradigm to utilize motion and interaction features from cooperative information. Specifically, we present V2X-Graph, a representative framework to achieve interpretable and end-to-end trajectory feature fusion for cooperative motion forecasting. V2X-Graph is evaluated on V2X-Seq in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) scenarios.

While most existing methods consider this as a discrete problem, popularity actually evolves continuously, exhibiting rich dynamic properties such as change rates and growth patterns. In this paper, we argue that popularity trajectory prediction is more practical, as it aims to forecast the entire trajectory of how popularity unfolds over arbitrary future time. This approach offers insights into both instantaneous popularity and the underlying dynamic properties. However, traditional methods for popularity trajectory prediction primarily rely on specific diffusion mechanism assumptions, which may not align well with real-world dynamics and compromise their performance. To address these limitations, we propose NODEPT, a novel approach based on neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for popularity trajectory prediction. NODEPT models the continuous dynamics of the underlying diffusion system using neural ODEs. We first employ an encoder to initialize the latent state representations of information cascades, consisting of two representation learning modules that capture the co-evolution structural characteristics and temporal patterns of cascades from different perspectives. More importantly, we then introduce an ODE-based generative module that learns the dynamics of the diffusion system in the latent space. Finally, a decoder transforms the latent state into the prediction of the future popularity trajectory. Our experimental results on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority and rationality of the proposed NODEPT method.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The time complexity analysis in section 4.4 contains error; we overlooked the impact of the memory module</p></details> |

However, for most problems of interest, MPC relies on the recursive solution of highly non-convex trajectory optimization problems, leading to high computational complexity and strong dependency on initialization. In this work, we present a unified framework to combine the main strengths of optimization-based and learning-based methods for MPC. Our approach entails embedding high-capacity, transformer-based neural network models within the optimization process for trajectory generation, whereby the transformer provides a near-optimal initial guess, or target plan, to a non-convex optimization problem. Our experiments, performed in simulation and the real world onboard a free flyer platform, demonstrate the capabilities of our framework to improve MPC convergence and runtime. Compared to purely optimization-based approaches, results show that our approach can improve trajectory generation performance by up to 75%, reduce the number of solver iterations by up to 45%, and improve overall MPC runtime by 7x without loss in performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures.

We study generative modeling for planning with datasets repurposed from offline reinforcement learning. Specifically, we identify temporal consistency in the absence of step-wise rewards as one key technical challenge. We introduce the Latent Plan Transformer (LPT), a novel model that leverages a latent variable to connect a Transformer-based trajectory generator and the final return. LPT can be learned with maximum likelihood estimation on trajectory-return pairs. In learning, posterior sampling of the latent variable naturally integrates sub-trajectories to form a consistent abstraction despite the finite context. At test time, the latent variable is inferred from an expected return before policy execution, realizing the idea of planning as inference. Our experiments demonstrate that LPT can discover improved decisions from sub-optimal trajectories, achieving competitive performance across several benchmarks, including Gym-Mujoco, Franka Kitchen, Maze2D, and Connect Four. It exhibits capabilities in nuanced credit assignments, trajectory stitching, and adaptation to environmental contingencies. These results validate that latent variable inference can be a strong alternative to step-wise reward prompting.</p></details> |  |

Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 (Spotlight)</p></details> |

Traditional optimization methods for trajectory tracking face significant computational challenges and lack robustness in dynamic environments. Our approach employs deep reinforcement learning (RL) to overcome these limitations, leveraging 3D pointcloud data to perceive the environment without relying on memory-intensive obstacle representations like occupancy grids. The proposed system features two RL agents: one for predicting UAV velocities to follow a reference trajectory and another for managing collision avoidance in the presence of obstacles. This architecture ensures real-time performance and adaptability to uncertainties. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through simulated and real-world experiments, highlighting improvements over state-of-the-art RL and optimization-based methods. Additionally, a curriculum learning paradigm is employed to scale the algorithms to more complex environments, ensuring robust trajectory tracking and obstacle avoidance in both static and dynamic scenarios.</p></details> |  |

DisCo is a distributed contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithm, which allows a group of robots to optimize a time sequence of forces to objects and to their environment to accomplish tasks such as collaborative manipulation, robot team sports, and modular robot locomotion. We build our algorithm on a variant of the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), where each robot computes its own contact forces and contact-switching events from a smaller single-robot, contact-implicit trajectory optimization problem, while cooperating with other robots through dual variables, enforcing constraints between robots. Each robot iterates between solving its local problem, and communicating over a wireless mesh network to enforce these consistency constraints with its neighbors, ultimately converging to a coordinated plan for the group. The local problems solved by each robot are significantly less challenging than a centralized problem with all robots' contact forces and switching events, improving the computational efficiency, while also preserving the privacy of some aspects of each robot's operation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm in simulations of collaborative manipulation, multi-robot team sports scenarios, and in modular robot locomotion, where DisCo achieves $3$x higher success rates with a 2.5x to 5x faster computation time. Further, we provide results of hardware experiments on a modular truss robot, with three collaborating truss nodes planning individually while working together to produce a punctuated rolling-gate motion of the composite structure.

State-of-the-art human trajectory prediction methods are limited by their focus on collision avoidance and short-term planning, and their inability to model complex interactions of humans with the environment. In contrast, our approach overcomes these limitations by predicting sequences of human interactions with the environment and using this information to guide trajectory predictions over a horizon of up to 60s. We leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict interactions with the environment by conditioning the LLM prediction on rich contextual information about the scene. This information is given as a 3D Dynamic Scene Graph that encodes the geometry, semantics, and traversability of the environment into a hierarchical representation. We then ground these interaction sequences into multi-modal spatio-temporal distributions over human positions using a probabilistic approach based on continuous-time Markov Chains. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new semi-synthetic dataset of long-term human trajectories in complex indoor environments, which also includes annotations of human-object interactions. We show in thorough experimental evaluations that our approach achieves a 54% lower average negative log-likelihood and a 26.5% lower Best-of-20 displacement error compared to the best non-privileged (i.e., evaluated in a zero-shot fashion on the dataset) baselines for a time horizon of 60s.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures.

Detection methods in generative language models (GLMs) mainly focus on uncertainty estimation and embedding distance measurement, with the latter proven to be most effective in traditional linguistic tasks like summarization and translation. However, another complex generative scenario mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges to embedding-based methods due to its high-density feature of output spaces, but this feature causes larger discrepancies in the embedding shift trajectory between different samples in latent spaces. Hence, we propose a trajectory-based method TV score, which uses trajectory volatility for OOD detection in mathematical reasoning. Experiments show that our method outperforms all traditional algorithms on GLMs under mathematical reasoning scenarios and can be extended to more applications with high-density features in output spaces, such as multiple-choice questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.</p></details> | 6 pages 4 figures |

By combining sampling-based Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control with gradient-based Interior-Point Differential Dynamic Programming (IPDDP), we leverage their respective strengths in exploration and smoothing. The proposed method, MPPI-IPDDP, involves three steps: First, MPPI control is used to generate a coarse trajectory. Second, a collision-free convex corridor is constructed. Third, IPDDP is applied to smooth the coarse trajectory, utilizing the collision-free corridor from the second step. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the proposed algorithm to trajectory optimization for differential-drive wheeled mobile robots and point-mass quadrotors. In comparisons with other MPPI variants and continuous optimization-based solvers, our method shows superior performance in terms of computational robustness and trajectory smoothness.

| **[Choice between Partial Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22690v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI agents generate increasingly sophisticated behaviors, manually encoding human preferences to guide these agents becomes more challenging. To address this, it has been suggested that agents instead learn preferences from human choice data. This approach requires a model of choice behavior that the agent can use to interpret the data. For choices between partial trajectories of states and actions, previous models assume choice probabilities to be determined by the partial return or the cumulative advantage. We consider an alternative model based instead on the bootstrapped return, which adds to the partial return an estimate of the future return. Benefits of the bootstrapped return model stem from its treatment of human beliefs. Unlike partial return, choices based on bootstrapped return reflect human beliefs about the environment. Further, while recovering the reward function from choices based on cumulative advantage requires that those beliefs are correct, doing so from choices based on bootstrapped return does not. To motivate the bootstrapped return model, we formulate axioms and prove an Alignment Theorem. This result formalizes how, for a general class of human preferences, such models are able to disentangle goals from beliefs. This ensures recovery of an aligned reward function when learning from choices based on bootstrapped return. The bootstrapped return model also affords greater robustness to choice behavior. Even when choices are based on partial return, learning via a bootstrapped return model recovers an aligned reward function. The same holds with choices based on the cumulative advantage if the human and the agent both adhere to correct and consistent beliefs about the environment. On the other hand, if choices are based on bootstrapped return, learning via partial return or cumulative advantage models does not generally produce an aligned reward function.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Overtaking Trajectory Planning Framework Based on Spatio-temporal Topology and Reachable Set Analysis Ensuring Time Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22643v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating overtaking trajectories in high-speed scenarios presents significant challenges and is typically addressed through hierarchical planning methods. However, this method has two primary drawbacks. First, heuristic algorithms can only provide a single initial solution, which may lead to local optima and consequently diminish the quality of the solution. Second, the time efficiency of trajectory refinement based on numerical optimization is insufficient. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes an overtaking trajectory planning framework based on spatio-temporal topology and reachable set analysis (SROP), to improve trajectory quality and time efficiency. Specifically, this paper introduces topological classes to describe trajectories representing different overtaking behaviors, which support the spatio-temporal topological search method employed by the upper-layer planner to identify diverse initial paths. This approach helps prevent getting stuck in local optima, enhancing the overall solution quality by considering multiple initial solutions from distinct topologies. Moreover, the reachable set method is integrated into the lower-layer planner for parallel trajectory evaluation. This method enhances planning efficiency by decoupling vehicle model constraints from the optimization process, enabling parallel computation while ensuring control feasibility. Simulation results show that the proposed method improves the smoothness of generated trajectories by 66.8% compared to state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing trajectory quality. Additionally, this method reduces computation time by 62.9%, demonstrating its efficiency.</p></details> |  |

LCGA summarizes similar patterns of change over time into a few distinct categories called trajectory groups, which are then included as "treatments" in the MSM. MSMs are a class of causal models that correctly handle treatment-confounder feedback. The parameters of LCGA-MSMs can be consistently estimated using different estimators, such as inverse probability weighting (IPW), g-computation, and pooled longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimation (pooled LTMLE). These three estimators of the parameters of LCGA-MSMs are currently implemented in our package. In the context of a time-dependent outcome, we previously proposed a combination of LCGA and history-restricted MSMs (LCGA-HRMSMs). Our package provides additional functions to estimate the parameters of such models.

However, they face challenges due to their high-dimensional and unstable dynamics, as well as the complex contact-rich nature of the tasks. Model-based optimal control methods offer precise and systematic control but are limited by high computational complexity and accurate contact sensing. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) provides robustness and handles high-dimensional spaces but suffers from inefficient learning, unnatural motion, and sim-to-real gaps. To address these challenges, we introduce Opt2Skill, an end-to-end pipeline that combines model-based trajectory optimization with RL to achieve robust whole-body loco-manipulation. We generate reference motions for the Digit humanoid robot using differential dynamic programming (DDP) and train RL policies to track these trajectories. Our results demonstrate that Opt2Skill outperforms pure RL methods in both training efficiency and task performance, with optimal trajectories that account for torque limits enhancing trajectory tracking. We successfully transfer our approach to real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a method for the learning of the recovery trajectory of an individual patient, as they undertake exercises as part of their physical therapy towards recovery of their loss of movement ability, following a critical illness. The difference between the Movement Recovery Scores (MRSs) attained by a patient, when undertaking a given exercise routine on successive instances, is given by a statistical distance/divergence between the (posterior) probabilities of random graphs that are Bayesianly learnt using time series data on locations of 20 of the patient's joints, recorded on an e-platform as the patient exercises. This allows for the computation of the MRS on every occasion the patient undertakes this exercise, using which, the recovery trajectory is drawn. We learn each graph as a Random Geometric Graph drawn in a probabilistic metric space, and identify the closed-form marginal posterior of any edge of the graph, given the correlation structure of the multivariate time series data on joint locations. On the basis of our recovery learning, we offer recommendations on the optimal exercise routines for patients with given level of mobility impairment.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we develop a strategy to locally adapt the step size parameter of HMC at every iteration by evaluating a low-rank approximation of the local Hessian and estimating its largest eigenvalue. We combine it with a strategy to similarly adapt the trajectory length by monitoring the no U-turn condition, resulting in an adaptive sampler, ATLAS: adapting trajectory length and step-size. We further use a delayed rejection framework for making multiple proposals that improves the computational efficiency of ATLAS, and develop an approach for automatically tuning its hyperparameters during warmup. We compare ATLAS with state-of-the-art samplers like NUTS on a suite of synthetic and real world examples, and show that i) unlike NUTS, ATLAS is able to accurately sample difficult distributions with complex geometries, ii) it is computationally competitive to NUTS for simpler distributions, and iii) it is more robust to the tuning of hyperparamters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/modichirag/AtlasSampler</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching (TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data.

However, ensuring safety throughout both the learning process and policy deployment remains a key challenge due to the risky exploration inherent in DRL, as well as the discrete nature of actions taken at intervals. These discontinuities, despite being part of a continuous action space, can lead to abrupt changes between successive actions, causing instability and unsafe intermediate states. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an integrated framework that combines DRL with a jerk-bounded trajectory generator (JBTG) and a robust low-level control strategy, significantly enhancing the safety, stability, and reliability of robotic manipulators. The low-level controller ensures the precise execution of DRL-generated commands, while the JBTG refines these motions to produce smooth, continuous trajectories that prevent abrupt or unsafe actions. The framework also includes pre-calculated safe velocity zones for smooth braking, preventing joint limit violations and ensuring compliance with kinematic constraints. This approach not only guarantees the robustness and safety of the robotic system but also optimizes motion control, making it suitable for practical applications. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through its application to a highly complex heavy-duty manipulator.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to the IEEE for potential publication</p></details> |

Modeling the interactions among agents is the key to understanding and predicting the dynamics of the complex system, e.g., predicting the trajectories of traffic participants in the city. Compared with interaction modeling in homogeneous systems such as pedestrians in a crowded scene, heterogeneous interaction modeling is less explored. Worse still, the error accumulation problem becomes more severe since the interactions are more complex. To tackle the two problems, this paper proposes heterogeneous interaction modeling with reduced accumulated error for multi-agent trajectory prediction. Based on the historical trajectories, our method infers the dynamic interaction graphs among agents, featured by directed interacting relations and interacting effects. A heterogeneous attention mechanism is defined on the interaction graphs for aggregating the influence from heterogeneous neighbors to the target agent. To alleviate the error accumulation problem, this paper analyzes the error sources from the spatial and temporal perspectives, and proposes to introduce the graph entropy and the mixup training strategy for reducing the two types of errors respectively. Our method is examined on three real-world datasets containing heterogeneous agents, and the experimental results validate the superiority of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, accepted by IEEE TNNLS</p></details> |

Yet, it poses challenges due to substantial parameter size and limited scalability, which is particularly critical in sequential decision-making scenarios where resources are constrained such as in robots and drones with limited computational power. Mamba, a promising new linear-time sequence model, offers performance on par with transformers while delivering substantially fewer parameters on long sequences. As it remains unclear whether Mamba is compatible with trajectory optimization, this work aims to conduct comprehensive experiments to explore the potential of Decision Mamba (dubbed DeMa) in offline RL from the aspect of data structures and essential components with the following insights: (1) Long sequences impose a significant computational burden without contributing to performance improvements since DeMa's focus on sequences diminishes approximately exponentially. Consequently, we introduce a Transformer-like DeMa as opposed to an RNN-like DeMa. (2) For the components of DeMa, we identify the hidden attention mechanism as a critical factor in its success, which can also work well with other residual structures and does not require position embedding. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our specially designed DeMa is compatible with trajectory optimization and surpasses previous methods, outperforming Decision Transformer (DT) with higher performance while using 30\% fewer parameters in Atari, and exceeding DT with only a quarter of the parameters in MuJoCo.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

Most ZS-ICL methods use large language models (LLMs) to generate (input, label) pairs as pseudo-demonstrations and leverage historical pseudo-demonstrations to help solve the current problem. They assume that problems are from the same task and traverse them in a random order. However, in real-world scenarios, problems usually come from diverse tasks, and only a few belong to the same task. The random traversing order may generate unreliable pseudo-demonstrations and lead to error accumulation. To address this problem, we reformulate ZS-ICL as a planning problem and propose a Demonstration-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach (DAWN-ICL), which leverages MCTS to strategically plan the problem-solving trajectories for ZS-ICL. In addition, to achieve effective and efficient Q value estimation, we propose a novel demonstration-aware Q-value function and use it to enhance the selection phase and accelerate the expansion and simulation phases in MCTS. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of DAWN-ICL on in-domain and cross-domain scenarios, and it even outperforms ICL using human-annotated labels.

| **[Context-Aware Trajectory Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19136v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory anomaly detection is crucial for effective decision-making in urban and human mobility management. Existing methods of trajectory anomaly detection generally focus on training a trajectory generative model and evaluating the likelihood of reconstructing a given trajectory. However, previous work often lacks important contextual information on the trajectory, such as the agent's information (e.g., agent ID) or geographic information (e.g., Points of Interest (POI)), which could provide additional information on accurately capturing anomalous behaviors. To fill this gap, we propose a context-aware anomaly detection approach that models contextual information related to trajectories. The proposed method is based on a trajectory reconstruction framework guided by contextual factors such as agent ID and contextual POI embedding. The injection of contextual information aims to improve the performance of anomaly detection. We conducted experiments in two cities and demonstrated that the proposed approach significantly outperformed existing methods by effectively modeling contextual information. Overall, this paper paves a new direction for advancing trajectory anomaly detection.</p></details> |  |

In the situation where gradient information is not available, the gradients need to be estimated from zeroth-order information, which typically involves computing finite-differences along isotropic random directions. This method suffers from high estimation errors, as the geometric features of the objective landscape may be overlooked during the isotropic sampling. In this work, we propose a non-isotropic sampling method to improve the gradient estimation procedure. Gradients in our method are estimated in a subspace spanned by historical trajectories of solutions, aiming to encourage the exploration of promising regions and hence improve the convergence. The proposed method uses a covariance matrix for sampling which is a convex combination of two parts. The first part is a thin projection matrix containing the basis of the subspace which is designed to improve the exploitation ability. The second part is the historical trajectories. We implement this method in zeroth-order federated settings, and show that the convergence rate aligns with existing ones while introducing no significant overheads in communication or local computation. The effectiveness of our proposal is verified on several numerical experiments in comparison to several commonly-used zeroth-order federated optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[VECTOR: Velocity-Enhanced GRU Neural Network for Real-Time 3D UAV Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23305v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper tackles the challenge of real-time 3D trajectory prediction for UAVs, which is critical for applications such as aerial surveillance and defense. Existing prediction models that rely primarily on position data struggle with accuracy, especially when UAV movements fall outside the position domain used in training. Our research identifies a gap in utilizing velocity estimates, first-order dynamics, to better capture the dynamics and enhance prediction accuracy and generalizability in any position domain. To bridge this gap, we propose a new trajectory prediction method using Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) within sequence-based neural networks. Unlike traditional methods that rely on RNNs or transformers, this approach forecasts future velocities and positions based on historical velocity data instead of positions. This is designed to enhance prediction accuracy and scalability, overcoming challenges faced by conventional models in handling complex UAV dynamics. The methodology employs both synthetic and real-world 3D UAV trajectory data, capturing a wide range of flight patterns, speeds, and agility. Synthetic data is generated using the Gazebo simulator and PX4 Autopilot, while real-world data comes from the UZH-FPV and Mid-Air drone racing datasets. The GRU-based models significantly outperform state-of-the-art RNN approaches, with a mean square error (MSE) as low as 2 x 10^-8. Overall, our findings confirm the effectiveness of incorporating velocity data in improving the accuracy of UAV trajectory predictions across both synthetic and real-world scenarios, in and out of position data distributions. Finally, we open-source our 5000 trajectories dataset and a ROS 2 package to facilitate the integration with existing ROS-based UAV systems.</p></details> |  |

Advances in machine learning have made traditional image and text-based CAPTCHAs vulnerable to attacks, leading modern CAPTCHAs, such as GeeTest and Akamai, to incorporate behavioral analysis like mouse trajectory detection. Existing bypass techniques struggle to fully mimic human behavior, making it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of anti-bot measures. To address this, we propose a diffusion model-based mouse trajectory generation framework (DMTG), which controls trajectory complexity and produces realistic human-like mouse movements. DMTG also provides white-box and black-box testing methods to assess its ability to bypass CAPTCHA systems. In experiments, DMTG reduces bot detection accuracy by 4.75%-9.73% compared to other models. Additionally, it mimics physical human behaviors, such as slow initiation and directional force differences, demonstrating improved performance in both simulation and real-world CAPTCHA scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization for Spatial Microstructure Control in Electron Beam Metal Additive Manufacturing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18207v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metal additive manufacturing (AM) opens the possibility for spatial control of as-fabricated microstructure and properties. However, since the solid state diffusional transformations that drive microstructure outcomes are governed by nonlinear ODEs in terms of temperature, which is itself governed by PDEs over the entire part domain, solving for the system inputs needed to achieve desired microstructure distributions has proven difficult. In this work, we present a trajectory optimization approach for spatial control of microstructure in metal AM, which we demonstrate by controlling the hardness of a low-alloy steel in electron beam powder bed fusion (EB-PBF). To this end, we present models for thermal and microstructural dynamics. Next, we use experimental data to identify the parameters of the microstructure transformation dynamics. We then pose spatial microstructure control as a finite-horizon optimal control problem. The optimal power field trajectory is computed using an augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP) method with GPU acceleration. The resulting time-varying power fields are then realized on an EB-PBF machine through an approximation scheme. Measurements of the resultant hardness shows that the optimized power field trajectory is able to closely produce the desired hardness distribution.</p></details> | 6 pages, 6 figures |

Our approach integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and constraint-controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraint information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This ``gray box" method marries optimization-based safety and interpretability with powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and in the real robot. The results demonstrate that LeTO performs well in both simulated and real-world tasks. In addition, it is capable of generating trajectories that are less uncertain, higher quality, and smoother compared to existing imitation learning methods. Therefore, it is shown that LeTO provides a practical example of how to achieve the integration of neural networks with trajectory optimization. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> |  |

Their image rendering performance will severely degrade on viewpoints falling out of the recorded trajectory, where camera rays are untrained. We propose FreeVS, a novel fully generative approach that can synthesize camera views on free new trajectories in real driving scenes. To control the generation results to be 3D consistent with the real scenes and accurate in viewpoint pose, we propose the pseudo-image representation of view priors to control the generation process. Viewpoint transformation simulation is applied on pseudo-images to simulate camera movement in each direction. Once trained, FreeVS can be applied to any validation sequences without reconstruction process and synthesis views on novel trajectories. Moreover, we propose two new challenging benchmarks tailored to driving scenes, which are novel camera synthesis and novel trajectory synthesis, emphasizing the freedom of viewpoints. Given that no ground truth images are available on novel trajectories, we also propose to evaluate the consistency of images synthesized on novel trajectories with 3D perception models. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset show that FreeVS has a strong image synthesis performance on both the recorded trajectories and novel trajectories.

Although many methods have been explored, they all assign correlation coefficients to surrounding agents in a purely learning-based manner. In this study, we present ASPILin, which manually selects interacting agents and calculates their correlations instead of attention scores. Surprisingly, these simple modifications can significantly improve prediction performance and substantially reduce computational costs. Additionally, ASPILin models the interacting agents at each past time step separately, rather than only modeling the interacting agents at the current time step. This clarifies the causal chain of the target agent's historical trajectory and helps the model better understand dynamic interactions. We intentionally simplified our model in other aspects, such as map encoding. Remarkably, experiments conducted on the INTERACTION, highD, and CitySim datasets demonstrate that our method is efficient and straightforward, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/kkk00714/ASPILin</p></details> |

Traditional data-driven approaches often handle these tasks separately with specialized models. We introduce TranSPORTmer, a unified transformer-based framework capable of addressing all these tasks, showcasing its application to the intricate dynamics of multi-agent sports scenarios like soccer and basketball. Using Set Attention Blocks, TranSPORTmer effectively captures temporal dynamics and social interactions in an equivariant manner. The model's tasks are guided by an input mask that conceals missing or yet-to-be-predicted observations. Additionally, we introduce a CLS extra agent to classify states along soccer trajectories, including passes, possessions, uncontrolled states, and out-of-play intervals, contributing to an enhancement in modeling trajectories. Evaluations on soccer and basketball datasets show that TranSPORTmer outperforms state-of-the-art task-specific models in player forecasting, player forecasting-imputation, ball inference, and ball imputation. https://youtu.be/8VtSRm8oGoE</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACCV 2024</p></details> |

These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>ackno...</summary><p>acknowledgement added</p></details> |

For example, we can swing a bat when walking without having to re-learn such a policy from scratch by composing the individual skills of walking and bat swinging. Enabling robots to combine or compose skills is essential so they can learn novel skills and tasks faster with fewer real world samples. To this end, we propose a novel compositional approach called DSE- Diffusion Score Equilibrium that enables few-shot learning for novel skills by utilizing a combination of base policy priors. Our method is based on probabilistically composing diffusion policies to better model the few-shot demonstration data-distribution than any individual policy. Our goal here is to learn robot motions few-shot and not necessarily goal oriented trajectories. Unfortunately we lack a general purpose metric to evaluate the error between a skill or motion and the provided demonstrations. Hence, we propose a probabilistic measure - Maximum Mean Discrepancy on the Forward Kinematics Kernel (MMD-FK), that is task and action space agnostic. By using our few-shot learning approach DSE, we show that we are able to achieve a reduction of over 30% in MMD-FK across skills and number of demonstrations. Moreover, we show the utility of our approach through real world experiments by teaching novel trajectories to a robot in 5 demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>6(+1)...</summary><p>6(+1) pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

With recent advancements in differentiable rendering techniques, several methods have attempted to simultaneously optimize scene representations (NeRF or 3DGS) and camera poses. Despite recent progress, existing methods relying on traditional camera input tend to fail in high-speed (or equivalently low-frame-rate) scenarios. Event cameras, inspired by biological vision, record pixel-wise intensity changes asynchronously with high temporal resolution, providing valuable scene and motion information in blind inter-frame intervals. In this paper, we introduce the event camera to aid scene construction from a casually captured video for the first time, and propose Event-Aided Free-Trajectory 3DGS, called EF-3DGS, which seamlessly integrates the advantages of event cameras into 3DGS through three key components. First, we leverage the Event Generation Model (EGM) to fuse events and frames, supervising the rendered views observed by the event stream. Second, we adopt the Contrast Maximization (CMax) framework in a piece-wise manner to extract motion information by maximizing the contrast of the Image of Warped Events (IWE), thereby calibrating the estimated poses. Besides, based on the Linear Event Generation Model (LEGM), the brightness information encoded in the IWE is also utilized to constrain the 3DGS in the gradient domain. Third, to mitigate the absence of color information of events, we introduce photometric bundle adjustment (PBA) to ensure view consistency across events and frames. We evaluate our method on the public Tanks and Temples benchmark and a newly collected real-world dataset, RealEv-DAVIS.

However, due to localization errors/uncertainties, trajectory deconfliction can fail even if trajectories are perfectly shared between agents. To address this issue, we first present PARM and PARM*, perception-aware, decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planners that enable a team of agents to navigate uncertain environments while deconflicting trajectories and avoiding obstacles using perception information. PARM* differs from PARM as it is less conservative, using more computation to find closer-to-optimal solutions. While these methods achieve state-of-the-art performance, they suffer from high computational costs as they need to solve large optimization problems onboard, making it difficult for agents to replan at high rates. To overcome this challenge, we present our second key contribution, PRIMER, a learning-based planner trained with imitation learning (IL) using PARM* as the expert demonstrator. PRIMER leverages the low computational requirements at deployment of neural networks and achieves a computation speed up to 5500 times faster than optimization-based approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Cooperative Trajectory Planning: Principles for Human-Machine System Design on Trajectory Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16938v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores cooperative trajectory planning approaches within the context of human-machine shared control. In shared control research, it is typically assumed that the human and the automation use the same reference trajectory to stabilize the coupled system. However, this assumption is often incorrect, as they usually follow different trajectories, causing control conflicts at the action level that have not been widely researched. To address this, it is logical to extend shared control concepts to include human-machine interaction at the trajectory-level before action execution, resulting in a unified reference trajectory for both human and automation. This paper begins with a literature overview on approaches of cooperative trajectory planning. It then presents an approach of finding a joint trajectory by modelling cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process. A generally valid system structure is proposed for this purpose. Finally, it proposes concepts to implement cooperative trajectory planning as an agreement process.</p></details> |  |

However, existing research often neglects the consideration of the joint reasoning of scenario agents and lacks interpretability in trajectory prediction models, thereby limiting their practical application in real-world scenarios. To this purpose, an explainability-oriented trajectory prediction model is designed in this work, named Explainable Conditional Diffusion based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction Traj-Explainer, to retrieve the influencing factors of prediction and help understand the intrinsic mechanism of prediction. In Traj-Explainer, a modified conditional diffusion is well designed to capture the scenario multimodal trajectory pattern, and meanwhile, a modified Shapley Value model is assembled to rationally learn the importance of the global and scenario features. Numerical experiments are carried out by several trajectory prediction datasets, including Waymo, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD datasets. Furthermore, we evaluate the identified input factors which indicates that they are in agreement with the human driving experience, indicating the capability of the proposed model in appropriately learning the prediction.

| **[Influential Language Data Selection via Gradient Trajectory Pursuit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16710v1)** | 2024-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Curating a desirable dataset for training has been the core of building highly capable large language models (Touvron et al., 2023; Achiam et al., 2023; Team et al.,2024). Gradient influence scores (Pruthi et al., 2020; Xia et al., 2024) are shown to be correlated with model performance and are commonly used as the criterion for data selection. However, existing methods are built upon either individual sample rankings or inefficient matching process, leading to suboptimal performance or scaling up issues.In this paper, we propose Gradient Trajectory Pursuit (GTP), an algorithm that performs pursuit of gradient trajectories via jointly selecting data points under an L0-norm regularized objective. The proposed algorithm highlights: (1) joint selection instead of independent top-k selection, which automatically de-duplicates samples; (2) higher efficiency with compressive sampling processes, which can be further sped up using a distributed framework. In the experiments, we demonstrate the algorithm in both in-domain and target-domain selection benchmarks and show that it outperforms top-k selection and competitive algorithms consistently, for example, our algorithm chooses as low as 0.5% data to achieve full performance on the targeted instruction tuning tasks</p></details> |  |

Specifically, a pair of locations may not be lined up in a sequence especially when one location includes the other geographically. In this study, we propose a graph representation that retains information on the geographic hierarchy as well as the temporal order of visited locations, and have constructed a benchmark dataset for graph-structured trajectory extraction. The experiments with our baselines have demonstrated that it is possible to accurately predict visited locations and the order among them, but it remains a challenge to predict the hierarchical relations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incorporating Navigation Context into Inland Vessel Trajectory Prediction: A Gaussian Mixture Model and Transformer Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02344v3)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using data sources beyond the Automatic Identification System to represent the context a vessel is navigating in and consequently improve situation awareness is still rare in machine learning approaches to vessel trajectory prediction (VTP). In inland shipping, where vessel movement is constrained within fairways, navigational context information is indispensable. In this contribution targeting inland VTP, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) are applied, on a fused dataset of AIS and discharge measurements, to generate multi-modal distribution curves, capturing typical lateral vessel positioning in the fairway and dislocation speeds along the waterway. By sampling the probability density curves of the GMMs, feature vectors are derived which are used, together with spatio-temporal vessel features and fairway geometries, as input to a VTP transformer model. The incorporation of these distribution features of both the current and forthcoming navigation context improves prediction accuracy. The superiority of the model over a previously proposed transformer model for inland VTP is shown. The novelty lies in the provision of preprocessed, statistics-based features representing the conditioned spatial context, rather than relying on the model to extract relevant features for the VTP task from contextual data. Oversimplification of the complexity of inland navigation patterns by assuming a single typical route or selecting specific clusters prior to model application is avoided by giving the model access to the entire distribution information. The methodology's generalizability is demonstrated through the usage of data of 3 distinct river sections. It can be integrated into an interaction-aware prediction framework, where insights into the positioning of the actual vessel behavior in the overall distribution at the current location and discharge can enhance trajectory prediction accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Time Warping-based imputation of long gaps in human mobility trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16096v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Individual mobility trajectories are difficult to measure and often incur long periods of missingness. Aggregation of this mobility data without accounting for the missingness leads to erroneous results, underestimating travel behavior. This paper proposes Dynamic Time Warping-Based Multiple Imputation (DTWBMI) as a method of filling long gaps in human mobility trajectories in order to use the available data to the fullest extent. This method reduces spatiotemporal trajectories to time series of particular travel behavior, then selects candidates for multiple imputation on the basis of the dynamic time warping distance between the potential donor series and the series preceding and following the gap in the recipient series and finally imputes values multiple times. A simulation study designed to establish optimal parameters for DTWBMI provides two versions of the method. These two methods are applied to a real-world dataset of individual mobility trajectories with simulated missingness and compared against other methods of handling missingness. Linear interpolation outperforms DTWBMI and other methods when gaps are short and data are limited. DTWBMI outperforms other methods when gaps become longer and when more data are available.</p></details> | 28 pages, 8 figures |

In practice, different driving scenarios present varying levels of difficulty for trajectory prediction models. However, most existing research focuses on the average precision of prediction results, while ignoring the underlying distribution of the input scenarios. This paper proposes a critical example mining method that utilizes a data-driven approach to estimate the rareness of the trajectories. By combining the rareness estimation of observations with whole trajectories, the proposed method effectively identifies a subset of data that is relatively hard to predict BEFORE feeding them to a specific prediction model. The experimental results show that the mined subset has higher prediction error when applied to different downstream prediction models, which reaches +108.1% error (greater than two times compared to the average on dataset) when mining 5% samples. Further analysis indicates that the mined critical examples include uncommon cases such as sudden brake and cancelled lane-change, which helps to better understand and improve the performance of prediction models.</p></details> | 8 pages,6 figures |

However, existing MARL approaches often rely on the restrictive assumption that the number of entities (e.g., agents, obstacles) remains constant between training and inference. This overlooks scenarios where entities are dynamically removed or added during the inference trajectory -- a common occurrence in real-world environments like search and rescue missions and dynamic combat situations. In this paper, we tackle the challenge of intra-trajectory dynamic entity composition under zero-shot out-of-domain (OOD) generalization, where such dynamic changes cannot be anticipated beforehand. Our empirical studies reveal that existing MARL methods suffer significant performance degradation and increased uncertainty in these scenarios. In response, we propose FlickerFusion, a novel OOD generalization method that acts as a universally applicable augmentation technique for MARL backbone methods. Our results show that FlickerFusion not only achieves superior inference rewards but also uniquely reduces uncertainty vis-\`a-vis the backbone, compared to existing methods. For standardized evaluation, we introduce MPEv2, an enhanced version of Multi Particle Environments (MPE), consisting of 12 benchmarks. Benchmarks, implementations, and trained models are organized and open-sourced at flickerfusion305.github.io, accompanied by ample demo video renderings.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '24 Open-World Agents Workshop</p></details> |

However, current IRL works cannot learn incrementally from an ongoing trajectory because they have to wait to collect at least one complete trajectory to learn. To bridge the gap, this paper considers the problem of learning a reward function and a corresponding policy while observing the initial state-action pair of an ongoing trajectory and keeping updating the learned reward and policy when new state-action pairs of the ongoing trajectory are observed. We formulate this problem as an online bi-level optimization problem where the upper level dynamically adjusts the learned reward according to the newly observed state-action pairs with the help of a meta-regularization term, and the lower level learns the corresponding policy. We propose a novel algorithm to solve this problem and guarantee that the algorithm achieves sub-linear local regret $O(\sqrt{T}+\log T+\sqrt{T}\log T)$. If the reward function is linear, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear regret $O(\log T)$. Experiments are used to validate the proposed algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Imitative Trajectory Planning for Urban Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15607v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) faces challenges in trajectory planning for urban automated driving due to the poor convergence of RL and the difficulty in designing reward functions. The convergence problem is alleviated by combining RL with supervised learning. However, most existing approaches only reason one step ahead and lack the capability to plan for multiple future steps. Besides, although inverse reinforcement learning holds promise for solving the reward function design issue, existing methods for automated driving impose a linear structure assumption on reward functions, making them difficult to apply to urban automated driving. In light of these challenges, this paper proposes a novel RL-based trajectory planning method that integrates RL with imitation learning to enable multi-step planning. Furthermore, a transformer-based Bayesian reward function is developed, providing effective reward signals for RL in urban scenarios. Moreover, a hybrid-driven trajectory planning framework is proposed to enhance safety and interpretability. The proposed methods were validated on the large-scale real-world urban automated driving nuPlan dataset. The results demonstrated the significant superiority of the proposed methods over the baselines in terms of the closed-loop metrics.

The key question in AL is which unlabeled data should be selected for annotation. Existing deep AL methods arguably suffer from bias incurred by clabeled data, which takes a much lower percentage than unlabeled data in AL context. We observe that such an issue is severe in different types of data, such as vision and non-vision data. To address this issue, we propose a novel method, namely Manifold-Preserving Trajectory Sampling (MPTS), aiming to enforce the feature space learned from labeled data to represent a more accurate manifold. By doing so, we expect to effectively correct the bias incurred by labeled data, which can cause a biased selection of unlabeled data. Despite its focus on manifold, the proposed method can be conveniently implemented by performing distribution mapping with MMD (Maximum Mean Discrepancies). Extensive experiments on various vision and non-vision benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. Our source code can be found here.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories. We evaluate our methods in various outdoor scenes and compare the performance with other global navigation algorithms on a Husky robot. In practice, we observe at least a 15% improvement in traveling distance and around a 7% improvement in traversability.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We propose a semi-decentralized planner for the vehicles to seek VE-based fair trajectories, which can significantly improve computational efficiency through parallel computing among CAVs and enhance the safety of planned trajectories by ensuring equilibrium concordance among CAVs. Finally, experimental results show the advantages of the approach, including fast computation speed, high scalability, equilibrium concordance, and safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[EDRF: Enhanced Driving Risk Field Based on Multimodal Trajectory Prediction and Its Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14996v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driving risk assessment is crucial for both autonomous vehicles and human-driven vehicles. The driving risk can be quantified as the product of the probability that an event (such as collision) will occur and the consequence of that event. However, the probability of events occurring is often difficult to predict due to the uncertainty of drivers' or vehicles' behavior. Traditional methods generally employ kinematic-based approaches to predict the future trajectories of entities, which often yield unrealistic prediction results. In this paper, the Enhanced Driving Risk Field (EDRF) model is proposed, integrating deep learning-based multimodal trajectory prediction results with Gaussian distribution models to quantitatively capture the uncertainty of traffic entities' behavior. The applications of the EDRF are also proposed. It is applied across various tasks (traffic risk monitoring, ego-vehicle risk analysis, and motion and trajectory planning) through the defined concept Interaction Risk (IR). Adequate example scenarios are provided for each application to illustrate the effectiveness of the model.</p></details> |  |

Real-world scenarios frequently present challenges such as occlusions and incomplete scene observations, which can compromise predictive accuracy. Thus, traditional video-based methods often struggle due to limited temporal and spatial perspectives. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative. Having been trained on a large text corpus describing human behaviors, LLMs likely encode plausible sequences of human actions in a home environment. However, LLMs, trained primarily on text data, lack inherent spatial awareness and real-time environmental perception. They struggle with understanding physical constraints and spatial geometry. Therefore, to be effective in a real-world spatial scenario, we propose a multimodal prediction framework that enhances LLM-based action prediction by integrating physical constraints derived from human trajectories. Our experiments demonstrate that combining LLM predictions with trajectory data significantly improves overall prediction performance. This enhancement is particularly notable in situations where the LLM receives limited scene information, highlighting the complementary nature of linguistic knowledge and physical constraints in understanding and anticipating human behavior.</p></details> |  |

The core idea is to train an encoder to transform trajectories into representation vectors and then compute vector similarity to approximate the ground truth. However, existing methods face dual challenges of effectiveness and efficiency: 1) they all utilize Euclidean distance to compute representation similarity, which leads to the severe curse of dimensionality issue -- reducing the distinguishability among representations and significantly affecting the accuracy of subsequent similarity search tasks; 2) most of them are trained in triplets manner and often necessitate additional information which downgrades the efficiency; 3) previous studies, while emphasizing the scalability in terms of efficiency, overlooked the deterioration of effectiveness when the dataset size grows. To cope with these issues, we propose a simple, yet accurate, fast, scalable model that only uses a single-layer vanilla transformer encoder as the feature extractor and employs tailored representation similarity functions to approximate various ground truth similarity measures. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model significantly mitigates the curse of dimensionality issue and outperforms the state-of-the-arts in effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRL Optimization Trajectory Generation via Wireless Network Intent-Guided Diffusion Models for Optimizing Resource Allocation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14481v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancements in wireless communication fields, including low-altitude economies, 6G, and Wi-Fi, the scale of wireless networks continues to expand, accompanied by increasing service quality demands. Traditional deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based optimization models can improve network performance by solving non-convex optimization problems intelligently. However, they heavily rely on online deployment and often require extensive initial training. Online DRL optimization models typically make accurate decisions based on current channel state distributions. When these distributions change, their generalization capability diminishes, which hinders the responsiveness essential for real-time and high-reliability wireless communication networks. Furthermore, different users have varying quality of service (QoS) requirements across diverse scenarios, and conventional online DRL methods struggle to accommodate this variability. Consequently, exploring flexible and customized AI strategies is critical. We propose a wireless network intent (WNI)-guided trajectory generation model based on a generative diffusion model (GDM). This model can be generated and fine-tuned in real time to achieve the objective and meet the constraints of target intent networks, significantly reducing state information exposure during wireless communication. Moreover, The WNI-guided optimization trajectory generation can be customized to address differentiated QoS requirements, enhancing the overall quality of communication in future intelligent networks. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach achieves greater stability in spectral efficiency variations and outperforms traditional DRL optimization models in dynamic communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PTR: A Pre-trained Language Model for Trajectory Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14281v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal trajectory data is vital for web-of-things services and is extensively collected and analyzed by web-based hardware and platforms. However, issues such as service interruptions and network instability often lead to sparsely recorded trajectories, resulting in a loss of detailed movement data. As a result, recovering these trajectories to restore missing information becomes essential. Despite progress, several challenges remain unresolved. First, the lack of large-scale dense trajectory data hampers the performance of existing deep learning methods, which rely heavily on abundant data for supervised training. Second, current methods struggle to generalize across sparse trajectories with varying sampling intervals, necessitating separate re-training for each interval and increasing computational costs. Third, external factors crucial for the recovery of missing points are not fully incorporated. To address these challenges, we propose a framework called PTR. This framework mitigates the issue of limited dense trajectory data by leveraging the capabilities of pre-trained language models (PLMs). PTR incorporates an explicit trajectory prompt and is trained on datasets with multiple sampling intervals, enabling it to generalize effectively across different intervals in sparse trajectories. To capture external factors, we introduce an implicit trajectory prompt that models road conditions, providing richer information for recovering missing points. Additionally, we present a trajectory embedder that encodes trajectory points and transforms the embeddings of both observed and missing points into a format comprehensible to PLMs. Experimental results on two public trajectory datasets with three sampling intervals demonstrate the efficacy and scalability of PTR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Enhanced Multi-View Trajectory Representation Learning: Bridging the Gap through Self-Supervised Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13196v2)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modeling trajectory data with generic-purpose dense representations has become a prevalent paradigm for various downstream applications, such as trajectory classification, travel time estimation and similarity computation. However, existing methods typically rely on trajectories from a single spatial view, limiting their ability to capture the rich contextual information that is crucial for gaining deeper insights into movement patterns across different geospatial contexts. To this end, we propose MVTraj, a novel multi-view modeling method for trajectory representation learning. MVTraj integrates diverse contextual knowledge, from GPS to road network and points-of-interest to provide a more comprehensive understanding of trajectory data. To align the learning process across multiple views, we utilize GPS trajectories as a bridge and employ self-supervised pretext tasks to capture and distinguish movement patterns across different spatial views. Following this, we treat trajectories from different views as distinct modalities and apply a hierarchical cross-modal interaction module to fuse the representations, thereby enriching the knowledge derived from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that MVTraj significantly outperforms existing baselines in tasks associated with various spatial views, validating its effectiveness and practical utility in spatio-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  |

Current air traffic control systems fail to consider spoken instructions for traffic prediction, bringing significant challenges in detecting human errors during real-time traffic operations. Here, we present an automation paradigm integrating controlling intent into the information processing loop through the spoken instruction-aware flight trajectory prediction framework. A 3-stage progressive multi-modal learning paradigm is proposed to address the modality gap between the trajectory and spoken instructions, as well as minimize the data requirements. Experiments on a real-world dataset show the proposed framework achieves flight trajectory prediction with high predictability and timeliness, obtaining over 20% relative reduction in mean deviation error. Moreover, the generalizability of the proposed framework is also confirmed by various model architectures. The proposed framework can formulate full-automated information processing in real-world air traffic applications, supporting human error detection and enhancing aviation safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted in principle by Nature Communications</p></details> |

Currently, large generalized policies are trained to predict controls or trajectories using diffusion models, which have the desirable property of learning multimodal action distributions. However, generalizability comes with a cost - namely, larger model size and slower inference. Further, there is a known trade-off between performance and action horizon for Diffusion Policy (i.e., diffusing trajectories): fewer diffusion queries accumulate greater trajectory tracking errors. Thus, it is common practice to run these models at high inference frequency, subject to robot computational constraints. To address these limitations, we propose Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD), a method that uses diffusion to learn a distribution over policies for robotic tasks, rather than over trajectories. Our approach encodes demonstration trajectories into a latent space and then decodes them into policies using a hypernetwork. We employ a diffusion denoising model within this latent space to learn its distribution. We demonstrate that LWD can reconstruct the behaviors of the original policies that generated the trajectory dataset. LWD offers the benefits of considerably smaller policy networks during inference and requires fewer diffusion model queries. When tested on the Metaworld MT10 benchmark, LWD achieves a higher success rate compared to a vanilla multi-task policy, while using models up to ~18x smaller during inference. Additionally, since LWD generates closed-loop policies, we show that it outperforms Diffusion Policy in long action horizon settings, with reduced diffusion queries during rollout.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are difficult to realize safe navigation, considering uncertainties, complex environmental structures, and robot swarms. This paper introduces an extended state model predictive control planner with a safe probability field to address the multi-robot navigation problem in complex, dynamic, and uncertain environments. Initially, the safe probability field offers an innovative approach to model the uncertainty of external dynamic obstacles, combining it with an unconstrained optimization method to generate safe trajectories for multi-robot online. Subsequently, the extended state model predictive controller can accurately track these generated trajectories while considering the robots' inherent model constraints and state uncertainty, thus ensuring the practical feasibility of the planned trajectories. Simulation experiments show a success rate four times higher than that of state-of-the-art algorithms. Physical experiments demonstrate the method's ability to operate in real-time, enabling safe navigation for multi-robot in uncertain environments.</p></details> |  |

Even though LLMs have already been integrated into medicine to assist both clinicians and patients, the integration of LLMs within healthcare robots has not yet been explored for clinical settings. In this perspective paper, we investigate the groundbreaking developments in robotics and LLMs to uniquely identify the needed system requirements for designing health specific LLM based robots in terms of multi modal communication through human robot interactions (HRIs), semantic reasoning, and task planning. Furthermore, we discuss the ethical issues, open challenges, and potential future research directions for this emerging innovative field.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we draw inspiration from the sparse mixture-of-agents (SMoE) and propose a sparse mixture-of-agents (SMoA) framework to improve the efficiency and diversity of multi-agent LLMs. Unlike completely connected structures, SMoA introduces novel Response Selection and Early Stopping mechanisms to sparsify information flows among individual LLM agents, striking a balance between performance and efficiency. Additionally, inspired by the expert diversity principle in SMoE frameworks for workload balance between experts, we assign distinct role descriptions to each LLM agent, fostering diverse and divergent thinking. Extensive experiments on reasoning, alignment, and fairness benchmarks demonstrate that SMoA achieves performance comparable to traditional mixture-of-agents approaches but with significantly lower computational costs. Further analysis reveals that SMoA is more stable, has a greater capacity to scale, and offers considerable potential through hyper-parameter optimization. Code and data will be available at: https://github.com/David-Li0406/SMoA.</p></details> | Under Review |

Despite numerous efforts made to optimize LLMs for long contexts, challenges persist in robustly processing long inputs. In this paper, we introduce GraphReader, a graph-based agent system designed to handle long texts by structuring them into a graph and employing an agent to explore this graph autonomously. Upon receiving a question, the agent first undertakes a step-by-step analysis and devises a rational plan. It then invokes a set of predefined functions to read node content and neighbors, facilitating a coarse-to-fine exploration of the graph. Throughout the exploration, the agent continuously records new insights and reflects on current circumstances to optimize the process until it has gathered sufficient information to generate an answer. Experimental results on the LV-Eval dataset reveal that GraphReader, using a 4k context window, consistently outperforms GPT-4-128k across context lengths from 16k to 256k by a large margin. Additionally, our approach demonstrates superior performance on four challenging single-hop and multi-hop benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>[EMNL...</summary><p>[EMNLP 2024] The first four authors contributed equally, 29 pages</p></details> |

However, comprehensively evaluating the dialogue abilities of LLMs remains a challenge. Previous benchmarks have primarily focused on single-turn dialogues or provided coarse-grained and incomplete assessments of multi-turn dialogues, overlooking the complexity and fine-grained nuances of real-life dialogues. To address this issue, we introduce MT-Bench-101, specifically designed to evaluate the fine-grained abilities of LLMs in multi-turn dialogues. By conducting a detailed analysis of real multi-turn dialogue data, we construct a three-tier hierarchical ability taxonomy comprising 4208 turns across 1388 multi-turn dialogues in 13 distinct tasks. We then evaluate 21 popular LLMs based on MT-Bench-101, conducting comprehensive analyses from both ability and task perspectives and observing differing trends in LLMs performance across dialogue turns within various tasks. Further analysis indicates that neither utilizing common alignment techniques nor chat-specific designs has led to obvious enhancements in the multi-turn abilities of LLMs. Extensive case studies suggest that our designed tasks accurately assess the corresponding multi-turn abilities.

One of these scenarios can be formulated as an online continual learning (OCL) problem. That is, data come in an online fashion, and models are updated according to these streaming data. Two major OCL challenges are catastrophic forgetting and data imbalance. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an Analytic Exemplar-Free Online Continual Learning algorithm (AEF-OCL). The AEF-OCL leverages analytic continual learning principles and employs ridge regression as a classifier for features extracted by a large backbone network. It solves the OCL problem by recursively calculating the analytical solution, ensuring an equalization between the continual learning and its joint-learning counterpart, and works without the need to save any used samples (i.e., exemplar-free). Additionally, we introduce a Pseudo-Features Generator (PFG) module that recursively estimates the mean and the variance of real features for each class. It over-samples offset pseudo-features from the same normal distribution as the real features, thereby addressing the data imbalance issue. Experimental results demonstrate that despite being an exemplar-free strategy, our method outperforms various methods on the autonomous driving SODA10M dataset.

While they are capable of generating human-like responses, they can also produce undesirable output including potentially harmful information, racist or sexist language, and hallucinations. Alignment methods are designed to reduce such undesirable outputs via techniques such as fine-tuning, prompt engineering, and representation engineering. However, existing methods face several challenges: some require costly fine-tuning for every alignment task; some do not adequately remove undesirable concepts, failing alignment; some remove benign concepts, lowering the linguistic capabilities of LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Parsimonious Concept Engineering (PaCE), a novel activation engineering framework for alignment. First, to sufficiently model the concepts, we construct a large-scale concept dictionary in the activation space, in which each atom corresponds to a semantic concept. Given any alignment task, we instruct a concept partitioner to efficiently annotate the concepts as benign or undesirable. Then, at inference time, we decompose the LLM activations along the concept dictionary via sparse coding, to accurately represent the activations as linear combinations of benign and undesirable components. By removing the latter ones from the activations, we reorient the behavior of the LLM towards the alignment goal. We conduct experiments on tasks such as response detoxification, faithfulness enhancement, and sentiment revising, and show that PaCE achieves state-of-the-art alignment performance while maintaining linguistic capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2024.

| **[Navigating Extremes: Dynamic Sparsity in Large Output Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03171v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) has emerged as an alternative to post-training pruning for generating efficient models. In principle, DST allows for a more memory efficient training process, as it maintains sparsity throughout the entire training run. However, current DST implementations fail to capitalize on this in practice. Because sparse matrix multiplication is much less efficient than dense matrix multiplication on GPUs, most implementations simulate sparsity by masking weights. In this paper, we leverage recent advances in semi-structured sparse training to apply DST in the domain of classification with large output spaces, where memory-efficiency is paramount. With a label space of possibly millions of candidates, the classification layer alone will consume several gigabytes of memory. Switching from a dense to a fixed fan-in sparse layer updated with sparse evolutionary training (SET); however, severely hampers training convergence, especially at the largest label spaces. We find that poor gradient flow from the sparse classifier to the dense text encoder make it difficult to learn good input representations. By employing an intermediate layer or adding an auxiliary training objective, we recover most of the generalisation performance of the dense model. Overall, we demonstrate the applicability and practical benefits of DST in a challenging domain -- characterized by a highly skewed label distribution that differs substantially from typical DST benchmark datasets -- which enables end-to-end training with millions of labels on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 7 figures, NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we provide the first study demonstrating the privacy risks of speculative decoding. We observe that input-dependent patterns of correct and incorrect predictions can be leaked out to an adversary monitoring token generation times and packet sizes, leading to privacy breaches. By observing the pattern of correctly and incorrectly speculated tokens, we show that a malicious adversary can fingerprint queries and learn private user inputs with more than $90\%$ accuracy across three different speculative decoding techniques - REST (almost $100\%$ accuracy), LADE (up to $92\%$ accuracy), and BiLD (up to $95\%$ accuracy). We show that an adversary can also leak out confidential intellectual property used to design these techniques, such as data from data-stores used for prediction (in REST) at a rate of more than $25$ tokens per second, or even hyper-parameters used for prediction (in LADE). We also discuss mitigation strategies, such as aggregating tokens across multiple iterations and padding packets with additional bytes, to avoid such privacy or confidentiality breaches.</p></details> |  |

While, current advanced steganographic mapping is not suitable for LLMs since most users are restricted to accessing only the black-box API or user interface of the LLMs, thereby lacking access to the training vocabulary and its sampling probabilities. In this paper, we explore a black-box generative text steganographic method based on the user interfaces of large language models, which is called LLM-Stega. The main goal of LLM-Stega is that the secure covert communication between Alice (sender) and Bob (receiver) is conducted by using the user interfaces of LLMs. Specifically, We first construct a keyword set and design a new encrypted steganographic mapping to embed secret messages. Furthermore, to guarantee accurate extraction of secret messages and rich semantics of generated stego texts, an optimization mechanism based on reject sampling is proposed. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed LLM-Stega outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, accepted at ACM Multimedia 2024</p></details> |

One effective approach is to compress the long input contexts. Existing methods typically leverage the self-attention mechanism of the LLM itself for context compression. While these methods have achieved notable results, the compression process still involves quadratic time complexity, which limits their applicability. To mitigate this limitation, we propose the In-Context Former (IC-Former). Unlike previous methods, IC-Former does not depend on the target LLMs. Instead, it leverages the cross-attention mechanism and a small number of learnable digest tokens to directly condense information from the contextual word embeddings. This approach significantly reduces inference time, which achieves linear growth in time complexity within the compression range. Experimental results indicate that our method requires only 1/32 of the floating-point operations of the baseline during compression and improves processing speed by 68 to 112 times while achieving over 90% of the baseline performance on evaluation metrics. Overall, our model effectively reduces compression costs and makes real-time compression scenarios feasible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP2024(Findings)</p></details> |

This paper presents a work devoted to using large language models for question answering over source code in Python. The proposed method for implementing a source code question answering system involves fine-tuning a large language model on a unified dataset of questions and answers for Python code. To achieve the highest quality answers, we tested various models trained on datasets preprocessed in different ways: a dataset without grammar correction, a dataset with grammar correction, and a dataset augmented with the generated summaries. The model answers were also analyzed for errors manually. We report BLEU-4, BERTScore F1, BLEURT, and Exact Match metric values, along with the conclusions from the manual error analysis. The obtained experimental results highlight the current problems of the research area, such as poor quality of the public genuine question-answering datasets. In addition, the findings include the positive effect of the grammar correction of the training data on the testing metric values. The addressed findings and issues could be important for other researchers who attempt to improve the quality of source code question answering solutions.

When randomization is impossible, causal inference methods allow the estimation of treatment effects from retrospective analysis of observational data. However, such analyses rely on a number of assumptions, often including that of no unobserved confounding. In many practical settings, this assumption is violated when important variables are not explicitly measured in the clinical record. Prior work has proposed to address unobserved confounding with machine learning by imputing unobserved variables and then correcting for the classifier's mismeasurement. When such a classifier can be trained and the necessary assumptions are met, this method can recover an unbiased estimate of a causal effect. However, such work has been limited to synthetic data, simple classifiers, and binary variables. This paper extends this methodology by using a large language model trained on clinical notes to predict patients' smoking status, which would otherwise be an unobserved confounder. We then apply a measurement error correction on the categorical predicted smoking status to estimate the causal effect of transthoracic echocardiography on mortality in the MIMIC dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advancements In Medical Foundation Models: Explainability, Robustness, Security, and Beyond (AIM-FM) at NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

We examine the diversity of responses of various models to questions with multiple possible answers, comparing them with human responses. Our findings suggest that models' outputs are highly concentrated, reflecting a narrow, mainstream 'worldview', in comparison to humans, whose responses exhibit a much longer-tail. We examine three ways to increase models' output diversity: 1) increasing generation randomness via temperature sampling; 2) prompting models to answer from diverse perspectives; 3) aggregating outputs from several models. A combination of these measures significantly increases models' output diversity, reaching that of humans. We discuss implications of these findings for AI policy that wishes to preserve cultural diversity, an essential building block of a democratic social fabric.</p></details> |  |
| **[Textual Aesthetics in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02930v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image aesthetics is a crucial metric in the field of image generation. However, textual aesthetics has not been sufficiently explored. With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs), previous work has primarily focused on the correctness of content and the helpfulness of responses. Nonetheless, providing responses with textual aesthetics is also an important factor for LLMs, which can offer a cleaner layout and ensure greater consistency and coherence in content. In this work, we introduce a pipeline for aesthetics polishing and help construct a textual aesthetics dataset named TexAes. We propose a textual aesthetics-powered fine-tuning method based on direct preference optimization, termed TAPO, which leverages textual aesthetics without compromising content correctness. Additionally, we develop two evaluation methods for textual aesthetics based on text and image analysis, respectively. Our experiments demonstrate that using textual aesthetics data and employing the TAPO fine-tuning method not only improves aesthetic scores but also enhances performance on general evaluation datasets such as AlpacalEval and Anera-hard.</p></details> |  |
| **[Jailbreaking Large Language Models with Symbolic Mathematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11445v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in AI safety have led to increased efforts in training and red-teaming large language models (LLMs) to mitigate unsafe content generation. However, these safety mechanisms may not be comprehensive, leaving potential vulnerabilities unexplored. This paper introduces MathPrompt, a novel jailbreaking technique that exploits LLMs' advanced capabilities in symbolic mathematics to bypass their safety mechanisms. By encoding harmful natural language prompts into mathematical problems, we demonstrate a critical vulnerability in current AI safety measures. Our experiments across 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal an average attack success rate of 73.6\%, highlighting the inability of existing safety training mechanisms to generalize to mathematically encoded inputs. Analysis of embedding vectors shows a substantial semantic shift between original and encoded prompts, helping explain the attack's success. This work emphasizes the importance of a holistic approach to AI safety, calling for expanded red-teaming efforts to develop robust safeguards across all potential input types and their associated risks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks against Large Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02902v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLLMs) exhibit promising capabilities for processing multi-modal tasks across various application scenarios. However, their emergence also raises significant data security concerns, given the potential inclusion of sensitive information, such as private photos and medical records, in their training datasets. Detecting inappropriately used data in VLLMs remains a critical and unresolved issue, mainly due to the lack of standardized datasets and suitable methodologies. In this study, we introduce the first membership inference attack (MIA) benchmark tailored for various VLLMs to facilitate training data detection. Then, we propose a novel MIA pipeline specifically designed for token-level image detection. Lastly, we present a new metric called MaxR\'enyi-K%, which is based on the confidence of the model output and applies to both text and image data. We believe that our work can deepen the understanding and methodology of MIAs in the context of VLLMs. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/VL-MIA.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |
| **[Evaluating the Ability of Large Language Models to Generate Verifiable Specifications in VeriFast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02318v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static verification is a powerful method for enhancing software quality, but it demands significant human labor and resources. This is particularly true of static verifiers that reason about heap manipulating programs using an ownership logic. LLMs have shown promise in a number of software engineering activities, including code generation, test generation, proof generation for theorem provers, and specification generation for static verifiers. However, prior work has not explored how well LLMs can perform specification generation for specifications based in an ownership logic, such as separation logic. To address this gap, this paper explores the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs), specifically OpenAI's GPT models, in generating fully correct specifications based on separation logic for static verification of human-written programs in VeriFast. Our first experiment employed traditional prompt engineering and the second used Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting to identify and address common errors generated across the GPT models. The results indicate that GPT models can successfully generate specifications for verifying heap manipulating code with VeriFast. Furthermore, while CoT prompting significantly reduces syntax errors generated by the GPT models, it does not greatly improve verification error rates compared to prompt engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-CoLLM: Efficient and Adaptive Large Language Models Through Cloud-Edge Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02829v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in serving end-users with human-like intelligence. However, LLMs demand high computational resources, making it challenging to deploy them to satisfy various performance objectives, such as meeting the resource constraints on edge devices close to end-users or achieving high accuracy with ample resources. In this paper, we introduce CE-CoLLM, a novel cloud-edge collaboration framework that supports efficient and adaptive LLM inference for end-users at the edge with two modes, (1) low-latency edge standalone inference and (2) highly accurate cloud-edge collaborative inference. First, we show that the inherent high communication costs for transmitting LLM contextual information between the edge and cloud dominate the overall latency, making it inefficient and costly to deploy LLMs using cloud-edge collaboration. Second, we propose several critical techniques to address this challenge, including early-exit mechanism, cloud context manager, and quantization in cloud-edge collaboration to enable not only low-latency standalone edge inference but also efficient and adaptive cloud-edge collaborative inference for LLMs. Third, we perform comprehensive experimental analysis, which demonstrates that CE-CoLLM significantly reduces inference time by up to 13.81% and cloud computation costs by up to 84.55% compared to the popular cloud-based LLM deployment, while maintaining comparable model accuracy. The proposed approach effectively shifts the computational load to the edge, reduces the communication overhead, scales efficiently with multiple edge clients, and provides reliable LLM deployment using cloud-edge collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluation and Improvement of Fault Detection for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14419v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved significant success across various application domains, garnering substantial attention from different communities. Unfortunately, even for the best LLM, many \textit{faults} still exist that LLM cannot properly predict. Such faults will harm the usability of LLMs in general and could introduce safety issues in reliability-critical systems such as autonomous driving systems. How to quickly reveal these faults in real-world datasets that LLM could face is important, but challenging. The major reason is that the ground truth is necessary but the data labeling process is heavy considering the time and human effort. To handle this problem, in the conventional deep learning testing field, test selection methods have been proposed for efficiently evaluating deep learning models by prioritizing faults. However, despite their importance, the usefulness of these methods on LLMs is unclear, and lack of exploration. In this paper, we conduct the first empirical study to investigate the effectiveness of existing fault detection methods for LLMs. Experimental results on four different tasks~(including both code tasks and natural language processing tasks) and four LLMs~(e.g., LLaMA3 and GPT4) demonstrated that simple methods such as Margin perform well on LLMs but there is still a big room for improvement. Based on the study, we further propose \textbf{MuCS}, a prompt \textbf{Mu}tation-based prediction \textbf{C}onfidence \textbf{S}moothing framework to boost the fault detection capability of existing methods. Concretely, multiple prompt mutation techniques have been proposed to help collect more diverse outputs for confidence smoothing. The results show that our proposed framework significantly enhances existing methods with the improvement of test relative coverage by up to 70.53\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer-wise Importance Matters: Less Memory for Better Performance in Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11772v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have gained significant popularity for adapting pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream tasks, primarily due to their potential to significantly reduce memory and computational overheads. However, a common limitation in most PEFT approaches is their application of a uniform architectural design across all layers. This uniformity involves identical trainable modules and ignores the varying importance of each layer, leading to sub-optimal fine-tuning results. To overcome the above limitation and obtain better performance, we develop a novel approach, Importance-aware Sparse Tuning (IST), to fully utilize the inherent sparsity and select the most important subset of full layers with effective layer-wise importance scoring. The proposed IST is a versatile and plug-and-play technique compatible with various PEFT methods that operate on a per-layer basis. By leveraging the estimated importance scores, IST dynamically updates these selected layers in PEFT modules, leading to reduced memory demands. We further provide theoretical proof of convergence and empirical evidence of superior performance to demonstrate the advantages of IST over uniform updating strategies. Extensive experiments on a range of LLMs, PEFTs, and downstream tasks substantiate the effectiveness of our proposed method, showcasing IST's capacity to enhance existing layer-based PEFT methods.

Limited by cost and system complexity, only systems with sparsely-distributed sensors can be widely implemented, which desires advanced reconstruction algorithms to reduce artifacts. However, high computing memory and time consumption of traditional iterative reconstruction (IR) algorithms is practically unacceptable for large-scale 3D PA imaging. Here, we propose a point cloud-based IR algorithm that reduces memory consumption by several orders, wherein the 3D PA scene is modeled as a series of Gaussian-distributed spherical sources stored in form of point cloud. During the IR process, not only are properties of each Gaussian source, including its peak intensity (initial pressure value), standard deviation (size) and mean (position) continuously optimized, but also each Gaussian source itself adaptively undergoes destroying, splitting, and duplication along the gradient direction. This method, named the sliding Gaussian ball adaptive growth (SlingBAG) algorithm, enables high-quality large-scale 3D PA reconstruction with fast iteration and extremely low memory usage. We validated SlingBAG algorithm in both simulation study and in vivo animal experiments. The source code and data for SlingBAG, along with supplementary materials and demonstration videos, are now available in the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/JaegerCQ/SlingBAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added SlingBAG reconstruction of rat kidney and rat liver results; updated methods; added references</p></details> |

However, a barrier to effective assistance is the lack of personalization in LLM outputs to the author's communication style, specialized knowledge, and values. In this paper, we address this challenge by proposing Pearl, a LLM writing assistant personalized with a retriever that is trained to be generation-calibrated for personalization. Generation calibration ensures that our retriever selects historic user authored documents to augment an LLM prompt such that they are likely to help an LLM generation better adhere to a users' preferences. We propose two key novelties for training such a retriever: (1) A training data selection method that identifies user requests likely to benefit from personalization and documents that provide that benefit; and (2) A scale-calibrating KL-divergence objective that ensures that our retriever scores remain proportional to the downstream generation quality from using the document for personalized generation. In a series of holistic evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of Pearl in generating long-form texts on multiple social media datasets. Finally, we demonstrate how a generation-calibrated retriever can double as a performance predictor -- detecting low quality retrieval, and improving potentially under-performing outputs via revision with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Workshop on Customizable NLP at EMNLP 2024</p></details> |
| **[Harnessing Multimodal Large Language Models for Multimodal Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09698v4)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the field of Recommendation Systems (RSs). Most existing studies have focused on converting user behavior logs into textual prompts and leveraging techniques such as prompt tuning to enable LLMs for recommendation tasks. Meanwhile, research interest has recently grown in multimodal recommendation systems that integrate data from images, text, and other sources using modality fusion techniques. This introduces new challenges to the existing LLM-based recommendation paradigm which relies solely on text modality information. Moreover, although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) capable of processing multi-modal inputs have emerged, how to equip MLLMs with multi-modal recommendation capabilities remains largely unexplored. To this end, in this paper, we propose the Multimodal Large Language Model-enhanced Multimodaln Sequential Recommendation (MLLM-MSR) model. To capture the dynamic user preference, we design a two-stage user preference summarization method. Specifically, we first utilize an MLLM-based item-summarizer to extract image feature given an item and convert the image into text. Then, we employ a recurrent user preference summarization generation paradigm to capture the dynamic changes in user preferences based on an LLM-based user-summarizer. Finally, to enable the MLLM for multi-modal recommendation task, we propose to fine-tune a MLLM-based recommender using Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) techniques. Extensive evaluations across various datasets validate the effectiveness of MLLM-MSR, showcasing its superior ability to capture and adapt to the evolving dynamics of user preferences.</p></details> |  |

Since LVLMs are prone to hallucinations and there are currently few datasets and evaluation methods specifically designed for remote sensing, their performance is typically poor when applied to remote sensing tasks. To address these issues, this paper introduces a high quality remote sensing LVLMs dataset, DDFAV, created using data augmentation and data mixing strategies. Next, a training instruction set is produced based on some high-quality remote sensing images selected from the proposed dataset. Finally, we develop a remote sensing LVLMs hallucination evaluation method RSPOPE based on the proposed dataset and evaluate the zero-shot capabilities of different LVLMs. Our proposed dataset, instruction set, and evaluation method files are available at https://github.com/HaodongLi2024/rspope.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Natural Language Processing Approach to Support Biomedical Data Harmonization: Leveraging Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02730v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Biomedical research requires large, diverse samples to produce unbiased results. Automated methods for matching variables across datasets can accelerate this process. Research in this area has been limited, primarily focusing on lexical matching and ontology based semantic matching. We aimed to develop new methods, leveraging large language models (LLM) and ensemble learning, to automate variable matching. Methods: We utilized data from two GERAS cohort (European and Japan) studies to develop variable matching methods. We first manually created a dataset by matching 352 EU variables with 1322 candidate JP variables, where matched variable pairs were positive and unmatched pairs were negative instances. Using this dataset, we developed and evaluated two types of natural language processing (NLP) methods, which matched variables based on variable labels and definitions from data dictionaries: (1) LLM-based and (2) fuzzy matching. We then developed an ensemble-learning method, using the Random Forest model, to integrate individual NLP methods. RF was trained and evaluated on 50 trials. Each trial had a random split (4:1) of training and test sets, with the model's hyperparameters optimized through cross-validation on the training set. For each EU variable, 1322 candidate JP variables were ranked based on NLP-derived similarity scores or RF's probability scores, denoting their likelihood to match the EU variable. Ranking performance was measured by top-n hit ratio (HRn) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Results:E5 performed best among individual methods, achieving 0.90 HR-30 and 0.70 MRR. RF performed better than E5 on all metrics over 50 trials (P less than 0.001) and achieved an average HR 30 of 0.98 and MRR of 0.73. LLM-derived features contributed most to RF's performance. One major cause of errors in automatic variable matching was ambiguous variable definitions within data dictionaries.</p></details> | 32 pages, 2 figures |

Recent research indicates that the over-reliance on the Large Language Model (LLM) backbone, as one cause of the LVLM hallucination, inherently introduces bias from language priors, leading to insufficient context attention to the visual inputs. We tackle this issue of hallucination by mitigating such over-reliance through preference learning. We propose Vision-guided Direct Preference Optimization (V-DPO) to enhance visual context learning at training time. To interpret the effectiveness and generalizability of V-DPO on different types of training data, we construct a synthetic dataset containing both response- and image-contrast preference pairs, compared against existing human-annotated hallucination samples. Our approach achieves significant improvements compared with baseline methods across various hallucination benchmarks. Our analysis indicates that V-DPO excels in learning from image-contrast preference data, demonstrating its superior ability to elicit and understand nuances of visual context. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/YuxiXie/V-DPO.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2024 Findings; 9 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables (16 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |

A significant challenge, however, lies in the unstructured nature of social media data. In other words, textual data like social media is not labeled, and large-scale manual annotations are cost-prohibitive. In this study, we introduce a novel methodological framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to infer the mentioned travel modes from social media posts, and reason people's attitudes toward the associated travel mode, without the need for manual annotation. We compare different LLMs along with various prompting engineering methods in light of human assessment and LLM verification. We find that most social media posts manifest negative rather than positive sentiments. We thus identify the contributing factors to these negative posts and, accordingly, propose recommendations to traffic operators and policymakers.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages; Accepted by ITSC 2024</p></details> |

The scarcity of reliable knowledge in these conditions poses a distinct challenge for Large Language Models (LLMs) in supporting clinical management and delivering precise patient information underscoring the need for focused training on these 'zebra' cases. We present Zebra-Llama, a specialized context-aware language model with high precision Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capability, focusing on Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) as our case study. EDS, affecting 1 in 5,000 individuals, exemplifies the complexities of rare diseases with its diverse symptoms, multiple subtypes, and evolving diagnostic criteria. By implementing a novel context-aware fine-tuning methodology trained on questions derived from medical literature, patient experiences, and clinical resources, along with expertly curated responses, Zebra-Llama demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in handling EDS-related queries. On a test set of real-world questions collected from EDS patients and clinicians, medical experts evaluated the responses generated by both models, revealing Zebra-Llama's substantial improvements over base model (Llama 3.1-8B-Instruct) in thoroughness (77.5% vs. 70.1%), accuracy (83.0% vs. 78.8%), clarity (74.7% vs. 72.0%) and citation reliability (70.6% vs. 52.3%). Released as an open-source resource, Zebra-Llama not only provides more accessible and reliable EDS information but also establishes a framework for developing specialized AI solutions for other rare conditions. This work represents a crucial step towards democratizing expert-level knowledge in rare disease management, potentially transforming how healthcare providers and patients navigate the complex landscape of rare diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 4 figures, 1 supplementary figure</p></details> |

Despite its importance, formal verification of LLM factuality with such guarantees remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce FactTest, a novel framework that statistically assesses whether an LLM can confidently provide correct answers to given questions with high-probability correctness guarantees. We formulate factuality testing as hypothesis testing problem to enforce an upper bound of Type I errors at user-specified significance levels. Notably, we prove that our framework also ensures strong Type II error control under mild conditions and can be extended to maintain its effectiveness when covariate shifts exist. %These analyses are amenable to the principled NP framework. Our approach is distribution-free and works for any number of human-annotated samples. It is model-agnostic and applies to any black-box or white-box LM. Extensive experiments on question-answering (QA) and multiple-choice benchmarks demonstrate that \approach effectively detects hallucinations and improves the model's ability to abstain from answering unknown questions, leading to an over 40% accuracy improvement.</p></details> |  |

Automatic manga translation is a promising potential solution. However, it is a budding and underdeveloped field and presents complexities even greater than those found in standard translation due to the need to effectively incorporate visual elements into the translation process to resolve ambiguities. In this work, we investigate to what extent multimodal large language models (LLMs) can provide effective manga translation, thereby assisting manga authors and publishers in reaching wider audiences. Specifically, we propose a methodology that leverages the vision component of multimodal LLMs to improve translation quality and evaluate the impact of translation unit size, context length, and propose a token efficient approach for manga translation. Moreover, we introduce a new evaluation dataset -- the first parallel Japanese-Polish manga translation dataset -- as part of a benchmark to be used in future research. Finally, we contribute an open-source software suite, enabling others to benchmark LLMs for manga translation. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art results for Japanese-English translation and set a new standard for Japanese-Polish.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Therefore, accurate Device-directed Speech Detection (DDSD) from the follow-up queries is critical for enabling naturalistic user experience. To this end, we explore the notion of Large Language Models (LLMs) and model the first query when making inference about the follow-ups (based on the ASR-decoded text), via prompting of a pretrained LLM, or by adapting a binary classifier on top of the LLM. In doing so, we also exploit the ASR uncertainty when designing the LLM prompts. We show on the real-world dataset of follow-up conversations that this approach yields large gains (20-40% reduction in false alarms at 10% fixed false rejects) due to the joint modeling of the previous speech context and ASR uncertainty, compared to when follow-ups are modeled alone.</p></details> |  |

To date, most of the existing approaches are confined to single-task adaptation, whereas the requirements in real-world scenarios are inherently varied and continually evolving. Thus an ideal LVLM should sustain continual instruction tuning in the face of stream-task distributions (i.e., different domains, emerging capabilities, and new datasets) while minimizing the forgetting of previously acquired knowledge. To achieve this, we propose a new benchmark for COntinuAl inStruction Tuning on LVLMs (COAST), which encompasses the aforementioned domain-incremental, capability-incremental, and dataset-incremental configurations. In terms of methodology, we propose Continual LLaVA, a rehearsal-free method tailored for continual instruction tuning in LVLMs. To circumvent the additional overhead associated with experience replay, we freeze LVLMs and construct the dual increment embeddings for each input instruction to facilitate parameter-efficient tuning. Specifically, the increment embeddings can be decomposed into two principal components: 1) intrinsic increment embeddings to encode task-specific characteristics. To achieve this, we set up a low-rank pool containing candidate embeddings, from which we select the relevant ones based on their similarity with the user instructions; 2) contextual increment embeddings to investigate the inter-dependencies across tasks. In this regard, the low-rank embeddings chosen in the previous tasks are aggregated via learnable weighted sum to provide complementary hints. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed Continual LLaVA outperforms previous methods by significantly reducing the forgetting during the continual instruction tuning process.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging large-scale graph-based nationwide road network data across 49 states in the USA, our study first posits the Concurrency Hypothesis from intuitive observations, suggesting a significant likelihood of incidents occurring at neighboring nodes within the road network. To quantify this phenomenon, we introduce two novel metrics, Average Neighbor Crash Density (ANCD) and Average Neighbor Crash Continuity (ANCC), and subsequently employ them in statistical tests to validate the hypothesis rigorously. Building upon this foundation, we propose the Concurrency Prior (CP) method, a powerful approach designed to enhance the predictive capabilities of general Graph Neural Network (GNN) models in semi-supervised traffic incident prediction tasks. Our method allows GNNs to incorporate concurrent incident information, as mentioned in the hypothesis, via tokenization with negligible extra parameters. The extensive experiments, utilizing real-world data across states and cities in the USA, demonstrate that integrating CP into 12 state-of-the-art GNN architectures leads to significant improvements, with gains ranging from 3% to 13% in F1 score and 1.3% to 9% in AUC metrics.

| **[Improving Scientific Hypothesis Generation with Knowledge Grounded Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02382v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in various scientific domains, from natural language processing to complex problem-solving tasks. Their ability to understand and generate human-like text has opened up new possibilities for advancing scientific research, enabling tasks such as data analysis, literature review, and even experimental design. One of the most promising applications of LLMs in this context is hypothesis generation, where they can identify novel research directions by analyzing existing knowledge. However, despite their potential, LLMs are prone to generating ``hallucinations'', outputs that are plausible-sounding but factually incorrect. Such a problem presents significant challenges in scientific fields that demand rigorous accuracy and verifiability, potentially leading to erroneous or misleading conclusions. To overcome these challenges, we propose KG-CoI (Knowledge Grounded Chain of Ideas), a novel system that enhances LLM hypothesis generation by integrating external, structured knowledge from knowledge graphs (KGs). KG-CoI guides LLMs through a structured reasoning process, organizing their output as a chain of ideas (CoI), and includes a KG-supported module for the detection of hallucinations. With experiments on our newly constructed hypothesis generation dataset, we demonstrate that KG-CoI not only improves the accuracy of LLM-generated hypotheses but also reduces the hallucination in their reasoning chains, highlighting its effectiveness in advancing real-world scientific research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models generalize analogy solving like people can?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02348v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When we solve an analogy we transfer information from a known context to a new one through abstract rules and relational similarity. In people, the ability to solve analogies such as "body : feet :: table : ?" emerges in childhood, and appears to transfer easily to other domains, such as the visual domain "( : ) :: < : ?". Recent research shows that large language models (LLMs) can solve various forms of analogies. However, can LLMs generalize analogy solving to new domains like people can? To investigate this, we had children, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies (e.g., a b : a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain (Greek alphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols). As expected, children and adults easily generalized their knowledge to unfamiliar domains, whereas LLMs did not. This key difference between human and AI performance is evidence that these LLMs still struggle with robust human-like analogical transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparsing Law: Towards Large Language Models with Greater Activation Sparsity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02335v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Activation sparsity denotes the existence of substantial weakly-contributed elements within activation outputs that can be eliminated, benefiting many important applications concerned with large language models (LLMs). Although promoting greater activation sparsity within LLMs deserves deep studies, existing works lack comprehensive and quantitative research on the correlation between activation sparsity and potentially influential factors. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on the quantitative scaling properties and influential factors of the activation sparsity within decoder-only Transformer-based LLMs. Specifically, we propose PPL-$p\%$ sparsity, a precise and performance-aware activation sparsity metric that is applicable to any activation function. Through extensive experiments, we find several important phenomena. Firstly, different activation functions exhibit comparable performance but opposite training-time sparsity trends. The activation ratio (i.e., $1-\mathrm{sparsity\ ratio}$) evolves as a convergent increasing power-law and decreasing logspace power-law with the amount of training data for SiLU-activated and ReLU-activated LLMs, respectively. These demonstrate that ReLU is more efficient as the activation function than SiLU and can leverage more training data to improve activation sparsity. Secondly, the activation ratio linearly increases with the width-depth ratio below a certain bottleneck point, indicating the potential advantage of a deeper architecture at a fixed parameter scale. Finally, at similar width-depth ratios, we surprisingly find that the limit value of activation sparsity varies weakly with the parameter scale, i.e., the activation patterns within LLMs are insensitive to the parameter scale. These empirical laws towards LLMs with greater activation sparsity have important implications for making LLMs more efficient and interpretable.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Ref: Enhancing Reference Handling in Technical Writing with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00294v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in data synthesis but can be inaccurate in domain-specific tasks, which retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems address by leveraging user-provided data. However, RAGs require optimization in both retrieval and generation stages, which can affect output quality. In this paper, we present LLM-Ref, a writing assistant tool that aids researchers in writing articles from multiple source documents with enhanced reference synthesis and handling capabilities. Unlike traditional RAG systems that use chunking and indexing, our tool retrieves and generates content directly from text paragraphs. This method facilitates direct reference extraction from the generated outputs, a feature unique to our tool. Additionally, our tool employs iterative response generation, effectively managing lengthy contexts within the language model's constraints. Compared to baseline RAG-based systems, our approach achieves a $3.25\times$ to $6.26\times$ increase in Ragas score, a comprehensive metric that provides a holistic view of a RAG system's ability to produce accurate, relevant, and contextually appropriate responses. This improvement shows our method enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of writing assistance tools.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

This study empirically evaluates StarCoder2, an LLM optimized for code generation, in refactoring code across 30 open-source Java projects. We compare StarCoder2's performance against human developers, focusing on (1) code quality improvements, (2) types and effectiveness of refactorings, and (3) enhancements through one-shot and chain-of-thought prompting. Our results indicate that StarCoder2 reduces code smells by 20.1% more than developers, excelling in systematic issues like Long Statement and Magic Number, while developers handle complex, context-dependent issues better. One-shot prompting increases the unit test pass rate by 6.15% and improves code smell reduction by 3.52%. Generating five refactorings per input further increases the pass rate by 28.8%, suggesting that combining one-shot prompting with multiple refactorings optimizes performance. These findings provide insights into StarCoder2's potential and best practices for integrating LLMs into software refactoring, supporting more efficient and effective code improvement in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Defining and Evaluating Physical Safety for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02317v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to control robotic systems such as drones, but their risks of causing physical threats and harm in real-world applications remain unexplored. Our study addresses the critical gap in evaluating LLM physical safety by developing a comprehensive benchmark for drone control. We classify the physical safety risks of drones into four categories: (1) human-targeted threats, (2) object-targeted threats, (3) infrastructure attacks, and (4) regulatory violations. Our evaluation of mainstream LLMs reveals an undesirable trade-off between utility and safety, with models that excel in code generation often performing poorly in crucial safety aspects. Furthermore, while incorporating advanced prompt engineering techniques such as In-Context Learning and Chain-of-Thought can improve safety, these methods still struggle to identify unintentional attacks. In addition, larger models demonstrate better safety capabilities, particularly in refusing dangerous commands. Our findings and benchmark can facilitate the design and evaluation of physical safety for LLMs. The project page is available at huggingface.co/spaces/TrustSafeAI/LLM-physical-safety.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Creative Short Story Generation in Humans and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02316v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Storytelling is a fundamental aspect of human communication, relying heavily on creativity to produce narratives that are novel, appropriate, and surprising. While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated the ability to generate high-quality stories, their creative capabilities remain underexplored. Previous research has either focused on creativity tests requiring short responses or primarily compared model performance in story generation to that of professional writers. However, the question of whether LLMs exhibit creativity in writing short stories on par with the average human remains unanswered. In this work, we conduct a systematic analysis of creativity in short story generation across LLMs and everyday people. Using a five-sentence creative story task, commonly employed in psychology to assess human creativity, we automatically evaluate model- and human-generated stories across several dimensions of creativity, including novelty, surprise, and diversity. Our findings reveal that while LLMs can generate stylistically complex stories, they tend to fall short in terms of creativity when compared to average human writers.</p></details> | 14 pages |

We recently proposed efficient implementations of the Louvain, Leiden, and Label Propagation Algorithms (LPA) for community detection. However, these incur significant memory overhead from the use of collision-free per-thread hashtables. To address this, we introduce memory-efficient alternatives using weighted Misra-Gries (MG) sketches, which replace the per-thread hashtables, and reduce memory demands in Louvain, Leiden, and LPA implementations - while incurring only a minor quality drop (up to 1%) and moderate runtime penalties. We believe that these approaches, though slightly slower, are well-suited for parallel processing and could outperform current memory-intensive techniques on systems with many threads.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

While considerable research has evaluated these models from various perspectives, the extent to which LLMs can perform implicit and explicit emotion retrieval remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, this study investigates LLMs' emotion retrieval capabilities in commonsense. Through extensive experiments involving multiple models, we systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs on emotion retrieval. Specifically, we propose a supervised contrastive probing method to verify LLMs' performance for implicit and explicit emotion retrieval, as well as the diversity of the emotional events they retrieve. The results offer valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of LLMs in handling emotion retrieval.</p></details> |  |

Wearable wrist-based sEMG sensors have the potential to offer low friction, subtle, information rich, always available human-computer inputs. To this end, we introduce emg2qwerty, a large-scale dataset of non-invasive electromyographic signals recorded at the wrists while touch typing on a QWERTY keyboard, together with ground-truth annotations and reproducible baselines. With 1,135 sessions spanning 108 users and 346 hours of recording, this is the largest such public dataset to date. These data demonstrate non-trivial, but well defined hierarchical relationships both in terms of the generative process, from neurons to muscles and muscle combinations, as well as in terms of domain shift across users and user sessions. Applying standard modeling techniques from the closely related field of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), we show strong baseline performance on predicting key-presses using sEMG signals alone. We believe the richness of this task and dataset will facilitate progress in several problems of interest to both the machine learning and neuroscientific communities.

We notice the challenge that large language models (LLMs) face when engaging in temporal reasoning. Our preliminary experiments show that methods involving the generation of intermediate reasoning steps, such as chain-of-thought and program-aided language models, do not consistently boost the performance of complex temporal question-answering tasks. This limitation can be attributed to the LLMs' inadequate understanding of temporal information. To address this problem, we propose TempLogic, a novel framework designed specifically for temporal question-answering tasks across three levels of reasoning. TempLogic incorporates retrieval-guided context distillation, temporal data extraction, and tailor-made logic reasoning. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in solving intricate time-bound reasoning tasks.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for Chinese medicine, their performance is sub-optimal in pediatric applications due to inadequate instruction data and vulnerable training procedures. To address the above issues, this paper builds PedCorpus, a high-quality dataset of over 300,000 multi-task instructions from pediatric textbooks, guidelines, and knowledge graph resources to fulfil diverse diagnostic demands. Upon well-designed PedCorpus, we propose PediatricsGPT, the first Chinese pediatric LLM assistant built on a systematic and robust training pipeline. In the continuous pre-training phase, we introduce a hybrid instruction pre-training mechanism to mitigate the internal-injected knowledge inconsistency of LLMs for medical domain adaptation. Immediately, the full-parameter Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) is utilized to incorporate the general medical knowledge schema into the models. After that, we devise a direct following preference optimization to enhance the generation of pediatrician-like humanistic responses. In the parameter-efficient secondary SFT phase, a mixture of universal-specific experts strategy is presented to resolve the competency conflict between medical generalist and pediatric expertise mastery. Extensive results based on the metrics, GPT-4, and doctor evaluations on distinct doctor downstream tasks show that PediatricsGPT consistently outperforms previous Chinese medical LLMs. Our model and dataset will be open-source for community development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024.

For linearly-separable data, it is known that GD converges to the minimizer with arbitrarily large step sizes, a property which no longer holds when the problem is not separable. In fact, the behaviour can be much more complex -- a sequence of period-doubling bifurcations begins at the critical step size $2/\lambda$, where $\lambda$ is the largest eigenvalue of the Hessian at the solution. Using a smaller-than-critical step size guarantees convergence if initialized nearby the solution: but does this suffice globally? In one dimension, we show that a step size less than $1/\lambda$ suffices for global convergence. However, for all step sizes between $1/\lambda$ and the critical step size $2/\lambda$, one can construct a dataset such that GD converges to a stable cycle. In higher dimensions, this is actually possible even for step sizes less than $1/\lambda$. Our results show that although local convergence is guaranteed for all step sizes less than the critical step size, global convergence is not, and GD may instead converge to a cycle depending on the initialization.</p></details> |  |

Despite growing attention and rapid advancements in this field, the existing literature remains fragmented and lacks systematic organization, posing barriers to entry for newcomers. This gap motivates us to conduct a comprehensive survey of existing works on tool learning with LLMs. In this survey, we focus on reviewing existing literature from the two primary aspects (1) why tool learning is beneficial and (2) how tool learning is implemented, enabling a comprehensive understanding of tool learning with LLMs. We first explore the "why" by reviewing both the benefits of tool integration and the inherent benefits of the tool learning paradigm from six specific aspects. In terms of "how", we systematically review the literature according to a taxonomy of four key stages in the tool learning workflow: task planning, tool selection, tool calling, and response generation. Additionally, we provide a detailed summary of existing benchmarks and evaluation methods, categorizing them according to their relevance to different stages. Finally, we discuss current challenges and outline potential future directions, aiming to inspire both researchers and industrial developers to further explore this emerging and promising area. We also maintain a GitHub repository to continually keep track of the relevant papers and resources in this rising area at https://github.com/quchangle1/LLM-Tool-Survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article has been accepted by Frontiers of Computer Science (FCS), with the DOI: {10.1007/s11704-024-40678-2}</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained prominence across various domains, yet limited studies have explored the functional importance and performance contributions of individual layers within LLMs, especially from the perspective of activation distribution. In this work, we propose the Activation Variance-Sparsity Score (AVSS), a novel metric combining normalized activation variance and sparsity to assess each layer's contribution to model performance. By identifying and removing approximately the lowest 25% of layers based on AVSS, we achieve over 90% of original model performance across tasks such as question answering, language modeling, and sentiment classification, indicating that these layers may be non-essential. Our approach provides a systematic method for identifying less critical layers, contributing to efficient large language model architectures.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |

Specifically, we show that empirical barycentre sequences indexed by sample size are almost certainly relatively compact, with accumulation points comprising population barycentres. We give a sufficient regularity condition for the limit to be unique. When the limit is unique, we also establish a central limit theorem under a refined pair of moment and regularity conditions. Finally, we prove strong operator convergence of the empirical optimal transport maps to their population counterparts. Though our results naturally extend finite-dimensional counterparts, including associated regularity conditions, our techniques are distinctly different owing to the functional nature of the problem in the general setting. A key element is the characterisation of compact sets in the Bures-Wasserstein topology that reflects an ordered Heine-Borel property of the Bures-Wasserstein space.</p></details> |  |

ReverseNER tackles this challenge by constructing a reliable example library with the reversed process of NER. Rather than beginning with sentences, this method uses an LLM to generate entities based on their definitions and then expands them into full sentences. During sentence generation, the LLM is guided to replicate the structure of a specific 'feature sentence', extracted from the task sentences by clustering. This results in well-annotated sentences with clearly labeled entities, while preserving semantic and structural similarity to the task sentences. Once the example library is constructed, the method selects the most semantically similar example labels for each task sentence to support the LLM's inference. We also propose an entity-level self-consistency scoring mechanism to improve NER performance with LLMs. Experiments show that ReverseNER significantly outperforms traditional zero-shot NER with LLMs and surpasses several few-shot methods, marking a notable improvement in NER for domains with limited labeled data.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we find that low-rank pre-training, normally considered as efficient methods that will compromise performance, can be scalably effective when reduced parameters are precisely targeted. Specifically, applying the low-dimensional module only to the attention layer -- resolves this issue and enhances both effectiveness and efficiency. We refer to this structure as Low-dimensional Projected Attention (LPA) and provide an explanatory analysis. Through extensive experimentation at parameter scales of 130M, 370M, and scaling up to 3B, we have validated the effectiveness and scalability of LPA. Our results show that LPA model can save up to 12.4% in time while achieving an approximate 5% improvement in test perplexity (ppl) and on downstream tasks compared with the vanilla Transformer.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2024 (Main Conference)</p></details> |

Yet, the integration of tabular data remains notably underdeveloped, despite its foundational role in numerous real-world domains. This gap is critical for three main reasons. First, database or data warehouse data integration is essential for advanced applications; second, the vast and largely untapped resource of tabular data offers immense potential for analysis; and third, the business intelligence domain specifically demands adaptable, precise solutions that many current LLMs may struggle to provide. In response, we introduce TableGPT2, a model rigorously pre-trained and fine-tuned with over 593.8K tables and 2.36M high-quality query-table-output tuples, a scale of table-related data unprecedented in prior research. This extensive training enables TableGPT2 to excel in table-centric tasks while maintaining strong general language and coding abilities. One of TableGPT2's key innovations is its novel table encoder, specifically designed to capture schema-level and cell-level information. This encoder strengthens the model's ability to handle ambiguous queries, missing column names, and irregular tables commonly encountered in real-world applications. Similar to visual language models, this pioneering approach integrates with the decoder to form a robust large multimodal model. We believe the results are compelling: over 23 benchmarking metrics, TableGPT2 achieves an average performance improvement of 35.20% in the 7B model and 49.32% in the 72B model over prior benchmark-neutral LLMs, with robust general-purpose capabilities intact.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing ID-based Recommendation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02041v1)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently garnered significant attention in various domains, including recommendation systems. Recent research leverages the capabilities of LLMs to improve the performance and user modeling aspects of recommender systems. These studies primarily focus on utilizing LLMs to interpret textual data in recommendation tasks. However, it's worth noting that in ID-based recommendations, textual data is absent, and only ID data is available. The untapped potential of LLMs for ID data within the ID-based recommendation paradigm remains relatively unexplored. To this end, we introduce a pioneering approach called "LLM for ID-based Recommendation" (LLM4IDRec). This innovative approach integrates the capabilities of LLMs while exclusively relying on ID data, thus diverging from the previous reliance on textual data. The basic idea of LLM4IDRec is that by employing LLM to augment ID data, if augmented ID data can improve recommendation performance, it demonstrates the ability of LLM to interpret ID data effectively, exploring an innovative way for the integration of LLM in ID-based recommendation. We evaluate the effectiveness of our LLM4IDRec approach using three widely-used datasets. Our results demonstrate a notable improvement in recommendation performance, with our approach consistently outperforming existing methods in ID-based recommendation by solely augmenting input data.</p></details> |  |

Detecting pre-illness stages and analyzing the progression of neurological disorders through effective and efficient intelligent systems can be beneficial for timely diagnosis and early intervention. We propose using Large Language Models to extract features from free dialogues to detect cognitive decline. These features comprise high-level reasoning content-independent features (such as comprehension, decreased awareness, increased distraction, and memory problems). Our solution comprises (i) preprocessing, (ii) feature engineering via Natural Language Processing techniques and prompt engineering, (iii) feature analysis and selection to optimize performance, and (iv) classification, supported by automatic explainability. We also explore how to improve Chatgpt's direct cognitive impairment prediction capabilities using the best features in our models. Evaluation metrics obtained endorse the effectiveness of a mixed approach combining feature extraction with Chatgpt and a specialized Machine Learning model to detect cognitive decline within free-form conversational dialogues with older adults. Ultimately, our work may facilitate the development of an inexpensive, non-invasive, and rapid means of detecting and explaining cognitive decline.</p></details> |  |

Instead of working directly with the entire (large) network, analyzing sub-networks has become a popular approach. Due to a network's inherent inter-connectedness, sub-sampling is not a trivial task. While this problem has gained attention in recent years, it has not received sufficient attention from the statistics community. In this work, we provide a thorough comparison of seven graph sub-sampling algorithms by applying them to divide-and-conquer algorithms for community structure and core-periphery (CP) structure. After discussing the various algorithms and sub-sampling routines, we derive theoretical results for the mis-classification rate of the divide-and-conquer algorithm for CP structure under various sub-sampling schemes. We then perform extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data to compare the various methods. For the community detection task, we found that sampling nodes uniformly at random yields the best performance. For CP structure on the other hand, there was no single winner, but algorithms which sampled core nodes at a higher rate consistently outperformed other sampling routines, e.g., random edge sampling and random walk sampling. The varying performance of the sampling algorithms on different tasks demonstrates the importance of carefully selecting a sub-sampling routine for the specific application.</p></details> |  |

On The Robustness of Large Language Model IP Protection Methods Against Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05188v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging is a promising lightweight model empowerment technique that does not rely on expensive computing devices (e.g., GPUs) or require the collection of specific training data. Instead, it involves editing different upstream model parameters to absorb their downstream task capabilities. However, uncertified model merging can infringe upon the Intellectual Property (IP) rights of the original upstream models. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the robustness of IP protection methods under model merging scenarios. Specifically, we investigate two state-of-the-art IP protection techniques: Quantization Watermarking and Instructional Fingerprint, along with various advanced model merging technologies, such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-MERGING, and so on. Experimental results indicate that current Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking techniques cannot survive in the merged models, whereas model fingerprinting techniques can. Our research aims to highlight that model merging should be an indispensable consideration in the robustness assessment of model IP protection techniques, thereby promoting the healthy development of the open-source LLM community.

Anomalies in web service data, for example, can signal critical incidents such as system failures or server malfunctions, necessitating timely detection and response. However, most existing TSAD methodologies rely heavily on manual feature engineering or require extensive labeled training data, while also offering limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a pioneering framework called the Time Series Anomaly Multimodal Analyzer (TAMA), which leverages the power of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to enhance both the detection and interpretation of anomalies in time series data. By converting time series into visual formats that LMMs can efficiently process, TAMA leverages few-shot in-context learning capabilities to reduce dependence on extensive labeled datasets. Our methodology is validated through rigorous experimentation on multiple real-world datasets, where TAMA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in TSAD tasks. Additionally, TAMA provides rich, natural language-based semantic analysis, offering deeper insights into the nature of detected anomalies. Furthermore, we contribute one of the first open-source datasets that includes anomaly detection labels, anomaly type labels, and contextual description, facilitating broader exploration and advancement within this critical field. Ultimately, TAMA not only excels in anomaly detection but also provides a comprehensive approach for understanding the underlying causes of anomalies, pushing TSAD forward through innovative methodologies and insights.</p></details> | Under review |

In this study, we aim to propose a strong vision-language connector that enables MLLMs to achieve high accuracy while maintain low computation cost. We first reveal the existence of the visual anchors in Vision Transformer and propose a cost-effective search algorithm to extract them. Building on these findings, we introduce the Anchor Former (AcFormer), a novel vision-language connector designed to leverage the rich prior knowledge obtained from these visual anchors during pretraining, guiding the aggregation of information. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces computational costs by nearly two-thirds compared with baseline, while simultaneously outperforming baseline methods. This highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of AcFormer. Codes are available at https://github.com/liuhaogeng/Anchor-Former.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often struggle with real-world tasks without fine-tuning. As LLMs grow larger and more performant, fine-tuning for specialized tasks becomes increasingly expensive. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, which fine-tune only a subset of model parameters, offer a promising solution by reducing the computational costs of tuning LLMs while maintaining their performance. Existing studies have explored using PEFT and LLMs for various code-related tasks and found that the effectiveness of PEFT techniques is task-dependent. The application of PEFT techniques in unit test generation remains underexplored. The state-of-the-art is limited to using LLMs with full fine-tuning to generate unit tests. This paper investigates both full fine-tuning and various PEFT methods, including LoRA, (IA)^3, and prompt tuning, across different model architectures and sizes. We use well-established benchmark datasets to evaluate their effectiveness in unit test generation. Our findings show that PEFT methods can deliver performance comparable to full fine-tuning for unit test generation, making specialized fine-tuning more accessible and cost-effective. Notably, prompt tuning is the most effective in terms of cost and resource utilization, while LoRA approaches the effectiveness of full fine-tuning in several cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 1 listing</p></details> |
| **[Stabilization of a Class of Large-Scale Systems of Linear Hyperbolic PDEs via Continuum Approximation of Exact Backstepping Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19455v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish that stabilization of a class of linear, hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) with a large (nevertheless finite) number of components, can be achieved via employment of a backstepping-based control law, which is constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (i.e., as the number of components tends to infinity) of the PDE system. This is achieved by proving that the exact backstepping kernels, constructed for stabilization of the large-scale system, can be approximated (in certain sense such that exponential stability is preserved) by the backstepping kernels constructed for stabilization of a continuum version (essentially an infinite ensemble) of the original PDE system. The proof relies on construction of a convergent sequence of backstepping kernels that is defined such that each kernel matches the exact backstepping kernels (derived based on the original, large-scale system), in a piecewise constant manner with respect to an ensemble variable; while showing that they satisfy the continuum backstepping kernel equations. We present a numerical example that reveals that complexity of computation of stabilizing backstepping kernels may not scale with the number of components of the PDE state, when the kernels are constructed on the basis of the continuum version, in contrast to the case in which they are constructed on the basis of the original, large-scale system. In addition, we formally establish the connection between the solutions to the large-scale system and its continuum counterpart. Thus, this approach can be useful for design of computationally tractable, stabilizing backstepping-based control laws for large-scale PDE systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control</p></details> |
| **[Large Language Model Compression with Neural Architecture Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06479v2)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable reasoning abilities, allowing them to generalize across a wide range of downstream tasks, such as commonsense reasoning or instruction following. However, as LLMs scale, inference costs become increasingly prohibitive, accumulating significantly over their life cycle. This poses the question: Can we compress pre-trained LLMs to meet diverse size and latency requirements? We leverage Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to compress LLMs by pruning structural components, such as attention heads, neurons, and layers, aiming to achieve a Pareto-optimal balance between performance and efficiency. While NAS already achieved promising results on small language models in previous work, in this paper we propose various extensions that allow us to scale to LLMs. Compared to structural pruning baselines, we show that NAS improves performance up to 3.4% on MMLU with an on-device latency speedup.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often struggle with grasping pixel-level semantic details, e.g., the keypoints of an object. To bridge this gap, we introduce the novel challenge of Semantic Keypoint Comprehension, which aims to comprehend keypoints across different task scenarios, including keypoint semantic understanding, visual prompt-based keypoint detection, and textual prompt-based keypoint detection. Moreover, we introduce KptLLM, a unified multimodal model that utilizes an identify-then-detect strategy to effectively address these challenges. KptLLM underscores the initial discernment of semantics in keypoints, followed by the precise determination of their positions through a chain-of-thought process. With several carefully designed modules, KptLLM adeptly handles various modality inputs, facilitating the interpretation of both semantic contents and keypoint locations. Our extensive experiments demonstrate KptLLM's superiority in various keypoint detection benchmarks and its unique semantic capabilities in interpreting keypoints.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2024 |

However, when applied to large graphs, especially those sparse ones, this method performs unstably and unsatisfactorily. We make a detailed analysis on it and propose a novel method from the perspective of optimization. On fully connected graphs, the method is equivalent to the Green-function method and can be seen as another interpretation with physical meanings, while on non-fully connected graphs, it helps to explain why the Green-function method causes a mess on large sparse graphs. To solve this dilemma, we propose a workable approach to improve our proposed method. Unlike the original method, our improved method can also apply two accelerating techniques, Gaussian Elimination, and Anchored Graphs to become more efficient on large graphs. Finally, the extensive experiments prove our conclusions and the efficiency, accuracy, and stability of our improved Green's function method.</p></details> |  |

Faulty machine detection is critical when an unexpected fault occurs in a machine. From our experience, a training task can encounter two faults per day on average, possibly leading to a halt for hours. To address the drawbacks of the time-consuming and labor-intensive manual scrutiny, we propose Minder, an automatic faulty machine detector for distributed training tasks. The key idea of Minder is to automatically and efficiently detect faulty distinctive monitoring metric patterns, which could last for a period before the entire training task comes to a halt. Minder has been deployed in our production environment for over one year, monitoring daily distributed training tasks where each involves up to thousands of machines. In our real-world fault detection scenarios, Minder can accurately and efficiently react to faults within 3.6 seconds on average, with a precision of 0.904 and F1-score of 0.893.</p></details> |  |

Most prior work in this area has used LLMs to reason through steps from an initial to a goal state or criterion, thereby effectively reasoning in a forward direction. Nonetheless, many planning problems exhibit an inherent asymmetry such that planning backward from the goal is significantly easier -- for example, if there are bottlenecks close to the goal. We take inspiration from this observation and demonstrate that this bias holds for LLM planning as well: planning performance in one direction correlates with the planning complexity of the problem in that direction. However, our experiments also reveal systematic biases which lead to poor planning in the backward direction. With this knowledge, we propose a backward planning algorithm for LLMs that first flips the problem and then plans forward in the flipped problem. This helps avoid the backward bias, generate more diverse candidate plans, and exploit asymmetries between the forward and backward directions in planning problems -- we find that combining planning in both directions with self-verification improves the overall planning success rates by 4-24% in three planning domains.</p></details> | Under review |

However, developing an effective curriculum of environment distributions currently requires significant expertise, which must be repeated for every new domain. Our key insight is that environments are often naturally represented as code. Thus, we probe whether effective environment curriculum design can be achieved and automated via code generation by large language models (LLM). In this paper, we introduce Eurekaverse, an unsupervised environment design algorithm that uses LLMs to sample progressively more challenging, diverse, and learnable environments for skill training. We validate Eurekaverse's effectiveness in the domain of quadrupedal parkour learning, in which a quadruped robot must traverse through a variety of obstacle courses. The automatic curriculum designed by Eurekaverse enables gradual learning of complex parkour skills in simulation and can successfully transfer to the real-world, outperforming manual training courses designed by humans.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL), 2024.

However, current interactions between IR systems and LLMs remain limited, with LLMs merely serving as part of components within IR systems, and IR systems being constructed independently of LLMs. This separated architecture restricts knowledge sharing and deep collaboration between them. In this paper, we introduce Self-Retrieval, a novel end-to-end LLM-driven information retrieval architecture. Self-Retrieval unifies all essential IR functions within a single LLM, leveraging the inherent capabilities of LLMs throughout the IR process. Specifically, Self-Retrieval internalizes the retrieval corpus through self-supervised learning, transforms the retrieval process into sequential passage generation, and performs relevance assessment for reranking. Experimental results demonstrate that Self-Retrieval not only outperforms existing retrieval approaches by a significant margin, but also substantially enhances the performance of LLM-driven downstream applications like retrieval-augmented generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 Camera-ready Version.

| **[GestureGPT: Toward Zero-Shot Free-Form Hand Gesture Understanding with Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12821v5)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing gesture interfaces only work with a fixed set of gestures defined either by interface designers or by users themselves, which introduces learning or demonstration efforts that diminish their naturalness. Humans, on the other hand, understand free-form gestures by synthesizing the gesture, context, experience, and common sense. In this way, the user does not need to learn, demonstrate, or associate gestures. We introduce GestureGPT, a free-form hand gesture understanding framework that mimics human gesture understanding procedures to enable a natural free-form gestural interface. Our framework leverages multiple Large Language Model agents to manage and synthesize gesture and context information, then infers the interaction intent by associating the gesture with an interface function. More specifically, our triple-agent framework includes a Gesture Description Agent that automatically segments and formulates natural language descriptions of hand poses and movements based on hand landmark coordinates. The description is deciphered by a Gesture Inference Agent through self-reasoning and querying about the interaction context (e.g., interaction history, gaze data), which is managed by a Context Management Agent. Following iterative exchanges, the Gesture Inference Agent discerns the user's intent by grounding it to an interactive function. We validated our framework offline under two real-world scenarios: smart home control and online video streaming. The average zero-shot Top-1/Top-5 grounding accuracies are 44.79%/83.59% for smart home tasks and 37.50%/73.44% for video streaming tasks. We also provide an extensive discussion that includes rationale for model selection, generalizability, and future research directions for a practical system etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the ISS 2024 track of the Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction</p></details> |

Recently, Vision-Language~(VL) trackers have proposed to utilize additional natural language descriptions to enhance versatility in various applications. However, VL trackers are still inferior to State-of-The-Art (SoTA) visual trackers in terms of tracking performance. We found that this inferiority primarily results from their heavy reliance on manual textual annotations, which include the frequent provision of ambiguous language descriptions. In this paper, we propose ChatTracker to leverage the wealth of world knowledge in the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to generate high-quality language descriptions and enhance tracking performance. To this end, we propose a novel reflection-based prompt optimization module to iteratively refine the ambiguous and inaccurate descriptions of the target with tracking feedback. To further utilize semantic information produced by MLLM, a simple yet effective VL tracking framework is proposed and can be easily integrated as a plug-and-play module to boost the performance of both VL and visual trackers. Experimental results show that our proposed ChatTracker achieves a performance comparable to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the increased memory and computational costs associated with these models pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-limited devices. Structural pruning has emerged as a promising solution to reduce the costs of LLMs without requiring post-processing steps. Prior structural pruning methods either follow the dependence of structures at the cost of limiting flexibility, or introduce non-trivial additional parameters by incorporating different projection matrices. In this work, we propose a novel approach that relaxes the constraint imposed by regular structural pruning methods and eliminates the structural dependence along the embedding dimension. Our dimension-independent structural pruning method offers several benefits. Firstly, our method enables different blocks to utilize different subsets of the feature maps. Secondly, by removing structural dependence, we facilitate each block to possess varying widths along its input and output dimensions, thereby significantly enhancing the flexibility of structural pruning. We evaluate our method on various LLMs, including OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA-2, Phi-1.5, and Phi-2. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, showing for the first time that structural pruning can achieve an accuracy similar to semi-structural pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Interestingly, pruning can sometimes even enhance accuracy by removing noise that accumulates during training, particularly through matrix decompositions. However, recent work has primarily focused on single matrix decompositions or lower precision techniques, which may fail to fully capture structural patterns. To address these limitations, we introduce TRAWL (Tensor Reduced and Approximated Weights for Large Language Models), a technique that applies tensor decomposition across multiple weight matrices to effectively denoise LLMs by capturing global structural patterns. Our experiments show that TRAWL improves model performance by up to 16% over baseline models on benchmark datasets, without requiring additional data, training, or fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages.

Traditional approaches are limited as they first compute coverage trees on a quadrant coarsened grid H and then employ the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) paradigm to generate paths on G, making them inapplicable to grids with partially obstructed 2x2 blocks. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem directly on G, revolutionizing grid-based MCPP solving and establishing new NP-hardness results. We introduce Extended-STC (ESTC), a novel paradigm that extends STC to ensure complete coverage with bounded suboptimality, even when H includes partially obstructed blocks. Furthermore, we present LS-MCPP, a new algorithmic framework that integrates ESTC with three novel types of neighborhood operators within a local search strategy to optimize coverage paths directly on G. Unlike prior grid-based MCPP work, our approach also incorporates a versatile post-processing procedure that applies Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) techniques to MCPP for the first time, enabling a fusion of these two important fields in multi-robot coordination. This procedure effectively resolves inter-robot conflicts and accommodates turning costs by solving a MAPF variant, making our MCPP solutions more practical for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves solution quality and efficiency, managing up to 100 robots on grids as large as 256x256 within minutes of runtime. Validation with physical robots confirms the feasibility of our solutions under real-world conditions.</p></details> | Submitted to T-RO |

We evaluate zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings and show that LLMs struggle in certain conditions or achieve comparable results against existing methods. In addition, we provide some views on meta-learning combined with prompt learning. In the end, we conclude that the current state of LLMs cannot or barely outperform existing methods, which are usually much smaller.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 16 figures, Accepted by EMNLP 2024</p></details> |

It not only serves to identify limitations in existing course designs and provide a basis for curricular innovation, but also to offer quantitative insights for university administrative decision-making. Traditional evaluation methods, primarily comprising student surveys, instructor self-assessments, and expert reviews, often encounter challenges, including inherent subjectivity, feedback delays, inefficiencies, and limitations in addressing innovative teaching approaches. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) within artificial intelligence (AI) present promising new avenues for enhancing course evaluation processes. This study explores the application of LLMs in automated course evaluation from multiple perspectives and conducts rigorous experiments across 100 courses at a major university in China. The findings indicate that: (1) LLMs can be an effective tool for course evaluation; (2) their effectiveness is contingent upon appropriate fine-tuning and prompt engineering; and (3) LLM-generated evaluation results demonstrate a notable level of rationality and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

However, developing a well-calibrated confidence estimation model is challenging, as mistakes made by LLMs can be difficult to detect. We propose a novel method combining the LLM's self-consistency with labeled data and training an auxiliary model to estimate the correctness of its responses to questions. This auxiliary model predicts the correctness of responses based solely on their consistent information. To set up the learning problem, we use a weighted graph to represent the consistency among the LLM's multiple responses to a question. Correctness labels are assigned to these responses based on their similarity to the correct answer. We then train a graph neural network to estimate the probability of correct responses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms several of the most recent methods in confidence calibration across multiple widely adopted benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the proposed approach significantly improves the generalization capability of confidence calibration on out-of-domain (OOD) data.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces $\rm CALDERA$ -- a new post-training LLM compression algorithm that harnesses the inherent low-rank structure of a weight matrix $\mathbf{W}$ by approximating it via a low-rank, low-precision decomposition as $\mathbf{W} \approx \mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$. Here, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are low rank factors, and the entries of $\mathbf{Q}$, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are quantized. The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its $\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot performance of the compressed model is evaluated. Additionally, $\mathbf{L}$ and $\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently enhancing the zero-shot performance. $\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition by formulating it as an optimization problem $\min_{\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{L},\mathbf{R}}\lVert(\mathbf{Q} + \mathbf{L}\mathbf{R} - \mathbf{W})\mathbf{X}^\top\rVert_{\rm F}^2$, where $\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\mathbf{Q}, \mathbf{L}, \mathbf{R}$ are constrained to be representable using low-precision formats. Theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error of $\rm CALDERA$ are established using a rank-constrained regression framework, and the tradeoff between compression ratio and model performance is studied by analyzing the impact of target rank and quantization bit budget. Results illustrate that compressing LlaMa-$2$ $7$B/$13B$/$70$B and LlaMa-$3$ $8$B models using $\rm CALDERA$ outperforms existing post-training LLM compression techniques in the regime of less than $2.5$ bits per parameter.

Machine learning is a promising tool to extract information from these 3D models. However, high-fidelity meshes often contain hundreds of thousands of vertices, which creates unique challenges in building deep neural network architectures. Furthermore, patient-specific meshes may not be canonically aligned which limits the generalisation of machine learning algorithms. We propose LaB-GATr, a transfomer neural network with geometric tokenisation that can effectively learn with large-scale (bio-)medical surface and volume meshes through sequence compression and interpolation. Our method extends the recently proposed geometric algebra transformer (GATr) and thus respects all Euclidean symmetries, i.e. rotation, translation and reflection, effectively mitigating the problem of canonical alignment between patients. LaB-GATr achieves state-of-the-art results on three tasks in cardiovascular hemodynamics modelling and neurodevelopmental phenotype prediction, featuring meshes of up to 200,000 vertices. Our results demonstrate that LaB-GATr is a powerful architecture for learning with high-fidelity meshes which has the potential to enable interesting downstream applications.

Existing benchmarks are either manually constructed or are automatic, but lack the ability to evaluate the thought process of LLMs with arbitrary complexity. We contend that utilizing existing relational databases based on the entity-relationship (ER) model is a promising approach for constructing benchmarks as they contain structured knowledge that can be used to question LLMs. Unlike knowledge graphs, which are also used to evaluate LLMs, relational databases have integrity constraints that can be used to better construct complex in-depth questions and verify answers: (1) functional dependencies can be used to pinpoint critical keywords that an LLM must know to properly answer a given question containing certain attribute values; and (2) foreign key constraints can be used to join relations and construct multi-hop questions, which can be arbitrarily long and used to debug intermediate answers. We thus propose ERBench, which uses these integrity constraints to convert any database into an LLM benchmark. ERBench supports continuous evaluation as databases change, multimodal questions, and various prompt engineering techniques. In our experiments, we construct LLM benchmarks using databases of multiple domains and make an extensive comparison of contemporary LLMs. We show how ERBench can properly evaluate any LLM by not only checking for answer correctness, but also effectively verifying the rationales by looking for the right keywords.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Large-scale Soft Labels Necessary for Large-scale Dataset Distillation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15919v2)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In ImageNet-condensation, the storage for auxiliary soft labels exceeds that of the condensed dataset by over 30 times. However, are large-scale soft labels necessary for large-scale dataset distillation? In this paper, we first discover that the high within-class similarity in condensed datasets necessitates the use of large-scale soft labels. This high within-class similarity can be attributed to the fact that previous methods use samples from different classes to construct a single batch for batch normalization (BN) matching. To reduce the within-class similarity, we introduce class-wise supervision during the image synthesizing process by batching the samples within classes, instead of across classes. As a result, we can increase within-class diversity and reduce the size of required soft labels. A key benefit of improved image diversity is that soft label compression can be achieved through simple random pruning, eliminating the need for complex rule-based strategies. Experiments validate our discoveries. For example, when condensing ImageNet-1K to 200 images per class, our approach compresses the required soft labels from 113 GB to 2.8 GB (40x compression) with a 2.6% performance gain.

Current solutions, often limited by their focus, generalisability, or data dependency, fall short in addressing these complexities. Moreover, none of them examine the quality of LLM-generated UI design. In this work, we introduce DesignRepair, a novel dual-stream design guideline-aware system to examine and repair the UI design quality issues from both code aspect and rendered page aspect. We utilised the mature and popular Material Design as our knowledge base to guide this process. Specifically, we first constructed a comprehensive knowledge base encoding Google's Material Design principles into low-level component knowledge base and high-level system design knowledge base. After that, DesignRepair employs a LLM for the extraction of key components and utilizes the Playwright tool for precise page analysis, aligning these with the established knowledge bases. Finally, we integrate Retrieval-Augmented Generation with state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4 to holistically refine and repair frontend code through a strategic divide and conquer approach. Our extensive evaluations validated the efficacy and utility of our approach, demonstrating significant enhancements in adherence to design guidelines, accessibility, and user experience metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 47nd International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |

The performance of NL2SQL has been greatly enhanced with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of NL2SQL techniques powered by LLMs, covering its entire lifecycle from the following four aspects: (1) Model: NL2SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and under-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and instances; (2) Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due to training data scarcity, to NL2SQL benchmarks; (3) Evaluation: Evaluating NL2SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities; and (4) Error Analysis: analyzing NL2SQL errors to find the root cause and guiding NL2SQL models to evolve. Moreover, we provide a rule of thumb for developing NL2SQL solutions. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and open problems of NL2SQL in the LLMs era.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Supply Chain: Open Problems From the Security Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01604v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) is changing the software development paradigm and has gained huge attention from both academia and industry. Researchers and developers collaboratively explore how to leverage the powerful problem-solving ability of LLMs for specific domain tasks. Due to the wide usage of LLM-based applications, e.g., ChatGPT, multiple works have been proposed to ensure the security of LLM systems. However, a comprehensive understanding of the entire processes of LLM system construction (the LLM supply chain) is crucial but relevant works are limited. More importantly, the security issues hidden in the LLM SC which could highly impact the reliable usage of LLMs are lack of exploration. Existing works mainly focus on assuring the quality of LLM from the model level, security assurance for the entire LLM SC is ignored. In this work, we take the first step to discuss the potential security risks in each component as well as the integration between components of LLM SC. We summarize 12 security-related risks and provide promising guidance to help build safer LLM systems. We hope our work can facilitate the evolution of artificial general intelligence with secure LLM ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Fidelity Virtual Try-on with Large-Scale Unpaired Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01593v1)** | 2024-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual try-on (VTON) transfers a target clothing image to a reference person, where clothing fidelity is a key requirement for downstream e-commerce applications. However, existing VTON methods still fall short in high-fidelity try-on due to the conflict between the high diversity of dressing styles (\eg clothes occluded by pants or distorted by posture) and the limited paired data for training. In this work, we propose a novel framework \textbf{Boosted Virtual Try-on (BVTON)} to leverage the large-scale unpaired learning for high-fidelity try-on. Our key insight is that pseudo try-on pairs can be reliably constructed from vastly available fashion images. Specifically, \textbf{1)} we first propose a compositional canonicalizing flow that maps on-model clothes into pseudo in-shop clothes, dubbed canonical proxy. Each clothing part (sleeves, torso) is reversely deformed into an in-shop-like shape to compositionally construct the canonical proxy. \textbf{2)} Next, we design a layered mask generation module that generates accurate semantic layout by training on canonical proxy. We replace the in-shop clothes used in conventional pipelines with the derived canonical proxy to boost the training process. \textbf{3)} Finally, we propose an unpaired try-on synthesizer by constructing pseudo training pairs with randomly misaligned on-model clothes, where intricate skin texture and clothes boundaries can be generated. Extensive experiments on high-resolution ($1024\times768$) datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Notably, BVTON shows great generalizability and scalability to various dressing styles and data sources.</p></details> | Technical Report |

However, these large-scale datasets are often collected without explicit consent, raising ethical and privacy concerns. To address this, there have been proposals to use synthetic datasets for training face recognition models. Yet, such models still rely on real data to train the generative models and generally exhibit inferior performance compared to those trained on real datasets. One of these datasets, DigiFace, uses a graphics pipeline to generate different identities and different intra-class variations without using real data in training the models. However, the performance of this approach is poor on face recognition benchmarks, possibly due to the lack of realism in the images generated from the graphics pipeline. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for realism transfer aimed at enhancing the realism of synthetically generated face images. Our method leverages the large-scale face foundation model, and we adapt the pipeline for realism enhancement. By integrating the controllable aspects of the graphics pipeline with our realism enhancement technique, we generate a large amount of realistic variations-combining the advantages of both approaches. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that models trained using our enhanced dataset significantly improve the performance of face recognition systems over the baseline. The source code and datasets will be made available publicly.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Poseidon: Efficient Foundation Models for PDEs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19101v2)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Poseidon, a foundation model for learning the solution operators of PDEs. It is based on a multiscale operator transformer, with time-conditioned layer norms that enable continuous-in-time evaluations. A novel training strategy leveraging the semi-group property of time-dependent PDEs to allow for significant scaling-up of the training data is also proposed. Poseidon is pretrained on a diverse, large scale dataset for the governing equations of fluid dynamics. It is then evaluated on a suite of 15 challenging downstream tasks that include a wide variety of PDE types and operators. We show that Poseidon exhibits excellent performance across the board by outperforming baselines significantly, both in terms of sample efficiency and accuracy. Poseidon also generalizes very well to new physics that is not seen during pretraining. Moreover, Poseidon scales with respect to model and data size, both for pretraining and for downstream tasks. Taken together, our results showcase the surprising ability of Poseidon to learn effective representations from a very small set of PDEs during pretraining in order to generalize well to unseen and unrelated PDEs downstream, demonstrating its potential as an effective, general purpose PDE foundation model. Finally, the Poseidon model as well as underlying pretraining and downstream datasets are open sourced, with code being available at https://github.com/camlab-ethz/poseidon and pretrained models and datasets at https://huggingface.co/camlab-ethz.</p></details> |  |

Emerging research indicates that large vision-language models (VLMs) can enhance performance across various downstream vision-language understanding tasks. However, general-domain models often underperform in specialized fields. This study introduces a domain-specific Large Vision-Language Model, Human-Scene Vision-Language Model (HumanVLM), designed to provide a foundation for human-scene Vision-Language tasks. Specifically, (1) we create a large-scale human-scene multimodal image-text dataset (HumanCaption-10M) sourced from the Internet to facilitate domain-specific alignment; (2) develop a captioning approach for human-centered images, capturing human faces, bodies, and backgrounds, and construct a high-quality Human-Scene image-text dataset (HumanCaptionHQ, about 311k pairs) that contain as much detailed information as possible about human; (3) Using HumanCaption-10M and HumanCaptionHQ, we train a HumanVLM. In the experiments, we then evaluate our HumanVLM across varous downstream tasks, where it demonstrates superior overall performance among multimodal models of comparable scale, particularly excelling in human-related tasks and significantly outperforming similar models, including Qwen2VL and ChatGPT-4o. HumanVLM, alongside the data introduced, will stimulate the research in human-around fields.</p></details> | 34 pages,11 figures |

While Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) is commonly used to adapt these models, studies often prioritize parameter efficiency, neglecting GPU memory and training speed. To address this, we introduced the IISAN framework, significantly enhancing efficiency. However, IISAN was limited to symmetrical MFMs and identical text and image encoders, preventing the use of state-of-the-art Large Language Models. To overcome this, we developed IISAN-Versa, a versatile plug-and-play architecture compatible with both symmetrical and asymmetrical MFMs. IISAN-Versa employs a Decoupled PEFT structure and utilizes both intra- and inter-modal adaptation. It effectively handles asymmetry through a simple yet effective combination of group layer-dropping and dimension transformation alignment. Our research demonstrates that IISAN-Versa effectively adapts large text encoders, and we further identify a scaling effect where larger encoders generally perform better. IISAN-Versa also demonstrates strong versatility in our defined multimodal scenarios, which include raw titles and captions generated from images and videos. Additionally, IISAN-Versa achieved state-of-the-art performance on the Microlens public benchmark. We will release our code and datasets to support future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>The e...</summary><p>The extension of IISAN in SIGIR2024</p></details> |

However, most of these models rely on the Transformer architecture, which incurs quadratic complexity as input length increases. To address this, we introduce TSMamba, a linear-complexity foundation model for time series forecasting built on the Mamba architecture. The model captures temporal dependencies through both forward and backward Mamba encoders, achieving high prediction accuracy. To reduce reliance on large datasets and lower training costs, TSMamba employs a two-stage transfer learning process that leverages pretrained Mamba LLMs, allowing effective time series modeling with a moderate training set. In the first stage, the forward and backward backbones are optimized via patch-wise autoregressive prediction; in the second stage, the model trains a prediction head and refines other components for long-term forecasting. While the backbone assumes channel independence to manage varying channel numbers across datasets, a channel-wise compressed attention module is introduced to capture cross-channel dependencies during fine-tuning on specific multivariate datasets. Experiments show that TSMamba's zero-shot performance is comparable to state-of-the-art time series foundation models, despite using significantly less training data. It also achieves competitive or superior full-shot performance compared to task-specific prediction models. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SoniDo, a music foundation model (MFM) designed to extract hierarchical features from target music samples. By leveraging hierarchical intermediate features, SoniDo constrains the information granularity, leading to improved performance across various downstream tasks including both understanding and generative tasks. We specifically evaluated this approach on representative tasks such as music tagging, music transcription, music source separation, and music mixing. Our results reveal that the features extracted from foundation models provide valuable enhancements in training downstream task models. This highlights the capability of using features extracted from music foundation models as a booster for downstream tasks. Our approach not only benefits existing task-specific models but also supports music downstream tasks constrained by data scarcity. This paves the way for more effective and accessible music processing solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages with 14 figures</p></details> |

Has this achieved what the original FMs accomplished, i.e. the supplanting of traditional supervised learning in their domains? To answer we look at three modalities -- genomics, satellite imaging, and time series -- with multiple recent FMs and compare them to a standard supervised learning workflow: model development, hyperparameter tuning, and training, all using only data from the target task. Across these three specialized domains, we find that it is consistently possible to train simple supervised models -- no more complicated than a lightly modified wide ResNet or UNet -- that match or even outperform the latest foundation models. Our work demonstrates that the benefits of large-scale pretraining have yet to be realized in many specialized areas, reinforces the need to compare new FMs to strong, well-tuned baselines, and introduces two new, easy-to-use, open-source, and automated workflows for doing so.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

| **[Foundation AI Model for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02745v1)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models refer to artificial intelligence (AI) models that are trained on massive amounts of data and demonstrate broad generalizability across various tasks with high accuracy. These models offer versatile, one-for-many or one-for-all solutions, eliminating the need for developing task-specific AI models. Examples of such foundation models include the Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer (ChatGPT) and the Segment Anything Model (SAM). These models have been trained on millions to billions of samples and have shown wide-ranging and accurate applications in numerous tasks such as text processing (using ChatGPT) and natural image segmentation (using SAM). In medical image segmentation - finding target regions in medical images - there is a growing need for these one-for-many or one-for-all foundation models. Such models could obviate the need to develop thousands of task-specific AI models, which is currently standard practice in the field. They can also be adapted to tasks with datasets too small for effective training. We discuss two paths to achieve foundation models for medical image segmentation and comment on progress, challenges, and opportunities. One path is to adapt or fine-tune existing models, originally developed for natural images, for use with medical images. The second path entails building models from scratch, exclusively training on medical images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conformal Alignment: Knowing When to Trust Foundation Models with Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10301v3)** | 2024-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Before deploying outputs from foundation models in high-stakes tasks, it is imperative to ensure that they align with human values. For instance, in radiology report generation, reports generated by a vision-language model must align with human evaluations before their use in medical decision-making. This paper presents Conformal Alignment, a general framework for identifying units whose outputs meet a user-specified alignment criterion. It is guaranteed that on average, a prescribed fraction of selected units indeed meet the alignment criterion, regardless of the foundation model or the data distribution. Given any pre-trained model and new units with model-generated outputs, Conformal Alignment leverages a set of reference data with ground-truth alignment status to train an alignment predictor. It then selects new units whose predicted alignment scores surpass a data-dependent threshold, certifying their corresponding outputs as trustworthy. Through applications to question answering and radiology report generation, we demonstrate that our method is able to accurately identify units with trustworthy outputs via lightweight training over a moderate amount of reference data. En route, we investigate the informativeness of various features in alignment prediction and combine them with standard models to construct the alignment predictor.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Foundations of Tokenization: Statistical and Computational Concerns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11606v3)** | 2024-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization - the practice of converting strings of characters from an alphabet into sequences of tokens over a vocabulary - is a critical step in the NLP pipeline. The use of token representations is widely credited with increased model performance but is also the source of many undesirable behaviors, such as spurious ambiguity or inconsistency. Despite its recognized importance as a standard representation method in NLP, the theoretical underpinnings of tokenization are not yet fully understood. In particular, the impact of tokenization on statistical estimation has been investigated mostly through empirical means. The present paper contributes to addressing this theoretical gap by proposing a unified formal framework for representing and analyzing tokenizer models. Based on the category of stochastic maps, this framework enables us to establish general conditions for a principled use of tokenizers, and most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for a tokenizer model to preserve the consistency of statistical estimators. Additionally, we discuss statistical and computational concerns crucial for designing and implementing tokenizer models, such as inconsistency, ambiguity, tractability, and boundedness. The framework and results advanced in this paper contribute to building robust theoretical foundations for representations in neural language modeling that can inform future empirical research.</p></details> |  |

Deep learning has shown promise in exploring these relationships using various data types. However, transcriptomics, which provides detailed insights into cellular states, is still underused due to its high noise levels and limited data availability. Recent advancements in transcriptomics sequencing provide new opportunities to uncover valuable insights, especially with the rise of many new foundation models for transcriptomics, yet no benchmark has been made to robustly evaluate the effectiveness of these rising models for perturbation analysis. This article presents a novel biologically motivated evaluation framework and a hierarchy of perturbation analysis tasks for comparing the performance of pretrained foundation models to each other and to more classical techniques of learning from transcriptomics data. We compile diverse public datasets from different sequencing techniques and cell lines to assess models performance. Our approach identifies scVI and PCA to be far better suited models for understanding biological perturbations in comparison to existing foundation models, especially in their application in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Neuri...</summary><p>Neurips 2024 AIDrugX Workshop</p></details> |

As foundation models evolve, the demands for agents that can adapt in real-time and process multimodal data have grown. This survey provides a comprehensive review of mobile agent technologies, focusing on recent advancements that enhance real-time adaptability and multimodal interaction. Recent evaluation benchmarks have been developed better to capture the static and interactive environments of mobile tasks, offering more accurate assessments of agents' performance. We then categorize these advancements into two main approaches: prompt-based methods, which utilize large language models (LLMs) for instruction-based task execution, and training-based methods, which fine-tune multimodal models for mobile-specific applications. Additionally, we explore complementary technologies that augment agent performance. By discussing key challenges and outlining future research directions, this survey offers valuable insights for advancing mobile agent technologies.

This exploration is beneficial for finding good loss basins when training from scratch. It is not necessarily ideal when resuming from a powerful foundation model because it can lead to large deviations from the pre-trained initialization and, consequently, worse robustness and generalization. At the same time, strong regularization on all parameters can lead to under-fitting. We hypothesize that selectively regularizing the parameter space is the key to fitting and retraining the pre-trained knowledge. This paper proposes a new weight decay technique, Selective Projection Decay (SPD), that selectively imposes a strong penalty on certain layers while allowing others to change freely. Intuitively, SPD expands and contracts the parameter search space for layers with consistent and inconsistent loss reduction, respectively. Experimentally, when equipped with SPD, Adam consistently provides better in-distribution generalization and out-of-distribution robustness performance on multiple popular vision and language benchmarks.

However, addressing uncertainty in both perception (sensory interpretation) and decision-making (plan generation) remains a critical challenge for ensuring task reliability. We present a comprehensive framework to disentangle, quantify, and mitigate these two forms of uncertainty. We first introduce a framework for uncertainty disentanglement, isolating perception uncertainty arising from limitations in visual understanding and decision uncertainty relating to the robustness of generated plans. To quantify each type of uncertainty, we propose methods tailored to the unique properties of perception and decision-making: we use conformal prediction to calibrate perception uncertainty and introduce Formal-Methods-Driven Prediction (FMDP) to quantify decision uncertainty, leveraging formal verification techniques for theoretical guarantees. Building on this quantification, we implement two targeted intervention mechanisms: an active sensing process that dynamically re-observes high-uncertainty scenes to enhance visual input quality and an automated refinement procedure that fine-tunes the model on high-certainty data, improving its capability to meet task specifications. Empirical validation in real-world and simulated robotic tasks demonstrates that our uncertainty disentanglement framework reduces variability by up to 40% and enhances task success rates by 5% compared to baselines. These improvements are attributed to the combined effect of both interventions and highlight the importance of uncertainty disentanglement which facilitates targeted interventions that enhance the robustness and reliability of autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fine-...</summary><p>Fine-tuned models, code, and datasets are available at https://tinyurl.com/uncertainty-disentanglement</p></details> |

Investigating molecular data through multi-omics approaches is crucial for unraveling the complex biological mechanisms underlying cancer, thereby enabling more effective diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies. However, predicting patient outcomes through the integration of all available multi-omics data is still an under-study research direction. Here, we present SeNMo, a foundation model that has been trained on multi-omics data across 33 cancer types. SeNMo is particularly efficient in handling multi-omics data characterized by high-width and low-length attributes. We trained SeNMo for the task of overall survival of patients using pan-cancer multi-omics data involving 33 cancer sites from the GDC. The training multi-omics data includes gene expression, DNA methylation, miRNA expression, DNA mutations, protein expression modalities, and clinical data. SeNMo was validated on two independent cohorts: Moffitt Cancer Center and CPTAC lung squamous cell carcinoma. We evaluated the model's performance in predicting patient's overall survival using the C-Index. SeNMo performed consistently well in the training regime, reflected by the validation C-Index of 0.76 on GDC's public data. In the testing regime, SeNMo performed with a C-Index of 0.758 on a held-out test set. The model showed an average accuracy of 99.8% on the task of classifying the primary cancer type on the pan-cancer test cohort. SeNMo demonstrated robust performance on the classification task of predicting the primary cancer type of patients. SeNMo further demonstrated significant performance in predicting tertiary lymph structures from multi-omics data, showing generalizability across cancer types, molecular data types, and clinical endpoints.</p></details> |  |

Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a promising tool for disentangling FM representations, but they struggle to capture rare, yet crucial concepts in the data. We introduce Specialized Sparse Autoencoders (SSAEs), designed to illuminate these elusive dark matter features by focusing on specific subdomains. We present a practical recipe for training SSAEs, demonstrating the efficacy of dense retrieval for data selection and the benefits of Tilted Empirical Risk Minimization as a training objective to improve concept recall. Our evaluation of SSAEs on standard metrics, such as downstream perplexity and $L_0$ sparsity, show that they effectively capture subdomain tail concepts, exceeding the capabilities of general-purpose SAEs. We showcase the practical utility of SSAEs in a case study on the Bias in Bios dataset, where SSAEs achieve a 12.5\% increase in worst-group classification accuracy when applied to remove spurious gender information. SSAEs provide a powerful new lens for peering into the inner workings of FMs in subdomains.</p></details> |  |

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS Version w/ minor edits</p></details> |

In this work, we investigate for the first time whether such models are suitable for the specific domain of face recognition. We further propose and demonstrate the adaptation of these models for face recognition across different levels of data availability. Extensive experiments are conducted on multiple foundation models and datasets of varying scales for training and fine-tuning, with evaluation on a wide range of benchmarks. Our results indicate that, despite their versatility, pre-trained foundation models underperform in face recognition compared to similar architectures trained specifically for this task. However, fine-tuning foundation models yields promising results, often surpassing models trained from scratch when training data is limited. Even with access to large-scale face recognition training datasets, fine-tuned foundation models perform comparably to models trained from scratch, but with lower training computational costs and without relying on the assumption of extensive data availability. Our analysis also explores bias in face recognition, with slightly higher bias observed in some settings when using foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long Term Memory: The Foundation of AI Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15665v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) like GPTs, trained on vast datasets, have demonstrated impressive capabilities in language understanding, reasoning, and planning, achieving human-level performance in various tasks. Most studies focus on enhancing these models by training on ever-larger datasets to build more powerful foundation models. While training stronger models is important, enabling models to evolve during inference is equally crucial, a process we refer to as AI self-evolution. Unlike large-scale training, self-evolution may rely on limited data or interactions. Inspired by the columnar organization of the human cerebral cortex, we hypothesize that AI models could develop cognitive abilities and build internal representations through iterative interactions with their environment. To achieve this, models need long-term memory (LTM) to store and manage processed interaction data. LTM supports self-evolution by representing diverse experiences across environments and agents. In this report, we explore AI self-evolution and its potential to enhance models during inference. We examine LTM's role in lifelong learning, allowing models to evolve based on accumulated interactions. We outline the structure of LTM and the systems needed for effective data retention and representation. We also classify approaches for building personalized models with LTM data and show how these models achieve self-evolution through interaction. Using LTM, our multi-agent framework OMNE achieved first place on the GAIA benchmark, demonstrating LTM's potential for AI self-evolution. Finally, we present a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the importance of LTM for advancing AI technology and its practical applications.</p></details> | 56 pages, 13 figures |

While TSF methods are emerging these days, many of them require domain-specific data collection and model training and struggle with poor generalization performance on new domains. Foundation models aim to overcome this limitation. Pre-trained on large-scale language or time series data, they exhibit promising inferencing capabilities in new or unseen data. This has spurred a surge in new TSF foundation models. We propose a new benchmark, FoundTS, to enable thorough and fair evaluation and comparison of such models. FoundTS covers a variety of TSF foundation models, including those based on large language models and those pretrained on time series. Next, FoundTS supports different forecasting strategies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and full-shot, thereby facilitating more thorough evaluations. Finally, FoundTS offers a pipeline that standardizes evaluation processes such as dataset splitting, loading, normalization, and few-shot sampling, thereby facilitating fair evaluations. Building on this, we report on an extensive evaluation of TSF foundation models on a broad range of datasets from diverse domains and with different statistical characteristics. Specifically, we identify pros and cons and inherent limitations of existing foundation models, and we identify directions for future model design. We make our code and datasets available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FoundTS-C2B0.</p></details> |  |
| **[HSIGene: A Foundation Model For Hyperspectral Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12470v2)** | 2024-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) plays a vital role in various fields such as agriculture and environmental monitoring. However, due to the expensive acquisition cost, the number of hyperspectral images is limited, degenerating the performance of downstream tasks. Although some recent studies have attempted to employ diffusion models to synthesize HSIs, they still struggle with the scarcity of HSIs, affecting the reliability and diversity of the generated images. Some studies propose to incorporate multi-modal data to enhance spatial diversity, but the spectral fidelity cannot be ensured. In addition, existing HSI synthesis models are typically uncontrollable or only support single-condition control, limiting their ability to generate accurate and reliable HSIs. To alleviate these issues, we propose HSIGene, a novel HSI generation foundation model which is based on latent diffusion and supports multi-condition control, allowing for more precise and reliable HSI generation. To enhance the spatial diversity of the training data while preserving spectral fidelity, we propose a new data augmentation method based on spatial super-resolution, in which HSIs are upscaled first, and thus abundant training patches could be obtained by cropping the high-resolution HSIs. In addition, to improve the perceptual quality of the augmented data, we introduce a novel two-stage HSI super-resolution framework, which first applies RGB bands super-resolution and then utilizes our proposed Rectangular Guided Attention Network (RGAN) for guided HSI super-resolution. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is capable of generating a vast quantity of realistic HSIs for downstream tasks such as denoising and super-resolution. The code and models are available at https://github.com/LiPang/HSIGene.</p></details> |  |

SpineFM leverages the regular geometry of the spine, employing a novel inductive process to sequentially infer the location of each vertebra along the spinal column. Vertebrae are segmented using Medical-SAM-Adaptor, a robust foundation model that diverges from commonly used CNN-based models. We achieved outstanding results on two publicly available spine X-Ray datasets, with successful identification of 97.8\% and 99.6\% of annotated vertebrae, respectively. Of which, our segmentation reached an average Dice of 0.942 and 0.921, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, submitted to ISBI 2025</p></details> |

However, building a unified MLLM for multi-task learning in the medical field remains a thorny challenge. To mitigate the tug-of-war problem of multi-modal multi-task optimization in MLLMs, recent advances primarily focus on improving the LLM components, while neglecting the connector that bridges the gap between modalities. In this paper, we introduce Uni-Med, a novel medical generalist foundation model which consists of a universal visual feature extraction module, a connector mixture-of-experts (CMoE) module, and an LLM. Benefiting from the proposed CMoE that leverages a well-designed router with a mixture of projection experts at the connector, Uni-Med achieves efficient solution to the tug-of-war problem and can perform six different medical tasks including question answering, visual question answering, report generation, referring expression comprehension, referring expression generation and image classification. To the best of our knowledge, Uni-Med is the first effort to tackle multi-task interference at the connector in MLLMs. Extensive ablation experiments validate the effectiveness of introducing CMoE under any configuration, with up to an average 8% performance gains. We further provide interpretation analysis of the tug-of-war problem from the perspective of gradient optimization and parameter statistics. Compared to previous state-of-the-art medical MLLMs, Uni-Med achieves competitive or superior evaluation metrics on diverse tasks.

However, typical PEFT methods require storing multiple task-specific adapters, creating scalability issues as these adapters must be housed and run at the FM server. Traditional prompt tuning offers a potential solution by customising them through task-specific input prefixes, but it under-performs compared to other PEFT methods like LoRA. To address this gap, we propose Low-Rank Prompt Adaptation (LoPA), a prompt-tuning-based approach that performs on par with state-of-the-art PEFT methods and full fine-tuning while being more parameter-efficient and not requiring a server-based adapter. LoPA generates soft prompts by balancing between sharing task-specific information across instances and customization for each instance. It uses a low-rank decomposition of the soft-prompt component encoded for each instance to achieve parameter efficiency. We provide a comprehensive evaluation on multiple natural language understanding and code generation and understanding tasks across a wide range of foundation models with varying sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, its potential is limited by the sheer volume of images generated during the imaging procedure, which can take anywhere from 6-8 hours and often produce up to 1 million images, necessitating automated analysis. Additionally, the variability of these images, combined with the need for expert annotations and the scarcity of large, high-quality labeled datasets, constrains the effectiveness of current medical image analysis models. To address this, we introduce a novel large gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, called EndoExtend24, created by merging and re-stratifying the train/test splits of ten existing public and private datasets, ensuring no overlap of patient data across splits. EndoExtend24 includes over 226,000 labeled images, as well as dynamic class mappings, which allow unified training across datasets with differing labeling granularity, supporting up to 123 distinct pathological findings. Further, we propose to leverage domain adaptive pre-training of foundation models in computer vision trained with self-supervision on generic image data, to adapt them to the task of GIE medical diagnosis. Specifically, the EVA-02 model, which is based on the vision transformer architecture and was trained on ImageNet-22k with masked image modeling (using EVA-CLIP as a MIM teacher), is pre-trained on the novel EndoExtend24 dataset to achieve domain adaptation, and finally trained on the Capsule Endoscopy 2024 Challenge dataset. Experimental results demonstrate strong performance with an F1 score of 0.88, an improvement of about 39% over the baseline model's F1 score of 0.49. Additionally, the model achieved a macro AUC score of 0.993 and a balanced accuracy of 89.3%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Conceptual Explainers: Trustworthy Conceptual Explanations for Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12649v3)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision transformers (ViTs) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their capacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. Yet, the development of trustworthy explanation methods for ViTs has lagged, particularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of ViT predictions. Existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and conceptual models, fall short in this regard. This paper proposes five desiderata for explaining ViTs -- faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level structure, and parsimony -- and demonstrates the inadequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. We introduce a variational Bayesian explanation framework, dubbed ProbAbilistic Concept Explainers (PACE), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explanations. Our qualitative analysis reveals the distributions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of ViTs by modeling the joint distribution of patch embeddings and ViT's predictions. Moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level explanations, thus completing the multi-level structure of PACE. Through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PACE surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of the defined desiderata.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 41st International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2024)</p></details> |

Evaluating Cell AI Foundation Models in Kidney Pathology with Human-in-the-Loop Enrichment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00078v1)** | 2024-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training AI foundation models has emerged as a promising large-scale learning approach for addressing real-world healthcare challenges, including digital pathology. While many of these models have been developed for tasks like disease diagnosis and tissue quantification using extensive and diverse training datasets, their readiness for deployment on some arguably simplest tasks, such as nuclei segmentation within a single organ (e.g., the kidney), remains uncertain. This paper seeks to answer this key question, "How good are we?", by thoroughly evaluating the performance of recent cell foundation models on a curated multi-center, multi-disease, and multi-species external testing dataset. Additionally, we tackle a more challenging question, "How can we improve?", by developing and assessing human-in-the-loop data enrichment strategies aimed at enhancing model performance while minimizing the reliance on pixel-level human annotation. To address the first question, we curated a multicenter, multidisease, and multispecies dataset consisting of 2,542 kidney whole slide images (WSIs). Three state-of-the-art (SOTA) cell foundation models-Cellpose, StarDist, and CellViT-were selected for evaluation. To tackle the second question, we explored data enrichment algorithms by distilling predictions from the different foundation models with a human-in-the-loop framework, aiming to further enhance foundation model performance with minimal human efforts. Our experimental results showed that all three foundation models improved over their baselines with model fine-tuning with enriched data. Interestingly, the baseline model with the highest F1 score does not yield the best segmentation outcomes after fine-tuning. This study establishes a benchmark for the development and deployment of cell vision foundation models tailored for real-world data applications.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we design a pretrained foundation model that can be prompted (at inference time) with multiple time-series examples, in order to forecast a target time-series into the future. Our foundation model is specifically trained to utilize examples from multiple related time-series in its context window (in addition to the history of the target time-series) to help it adapt to the specific distribution of the target domain at inference time. We show that such a foundation model that uses in-context examples at inference time can obtain much better performance on popular forecasting benchmarks compared to supervised deep learning methods, statistical models, as well as other time-series foundation models. Interestingly, our in-context fine-tuning approach even rivals the performance of a foundation model that is explicitly fine-tuned on the target domain.</p></details> |  |

Despite the substantial domain gaps in RS images that are characterized by variabilities such as location, wavelength, and sensor type, research in this area remains underexplored: (1) Current cross-domain methods primarily focus on Domain Adaptation (DA), which adapts models to predefined domains rather than to unseen ones; (2) Few studies targeting the RSDG issue, especially for semantic segmentation tasks, where existing models are developed for specific unknown domains, struggling with issues of underfitting on other unknown scenarios; (3) Existing RS foundation models tend to prioritize in-domain performance over cross-domain generalization. To this end, we introduce the first vision foundation model for RSDG semantic segmentation, CrossEarth. CrossEarth demonstrates strong cross-domain generalization through a specially designed data-level Earth-Style Injection pipeline and a model-level Multi-Task Training pipeline. In addition, for the semantic segmentation task, we have curated an RSDG benchmark comprising 28 cross-domain settings across various regions, spectral bands, platforms, and climates, providing a comprehensive framework for testing the generalizability of future RSDG models. Extensive experiments on this benchmark demonstrate the superiority of CrossEarth over existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codes and models will be available at https://github.com/Cuzyoung/CrossEarth</p></details> |

While the emergence of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal large language models (MM-LLMs) propels advancements in artificial general intelligence through their versatile capabilities, they still lack true any-to-any understanding and generation. Recently, the release of GPT-4o has showcased the remarkable potential of any-to-any LLMs for complex real-world tasks, enabling omnidirectional input and output across images, speech, and text. However, it is closed-source and does not support the generation of multimodal interleaved sequences. To address this gap, we present MIO, which is trained on a mixture of discrete tokens across four modalities using causal multimodal modeling. MIO undergoes a four-stage training process: (1) alignment pre-training, (2) interleaved pre-training, (3) speech-enhanced pre-training, and (4) comprehensive supervised fine-tuning on diverse textual, visual, and speech tasks. Our experimental results indicate that MIO exhibits competitive, and in some cases superior, performance compared to previous dual-modal baselines, any-to-any model baselines, and even modality-specific baselines. Moreover, MIO demonstrates advanced capabilities inherent to its any-to-any feature, such as interleaved video-text generation, chain-of-visual-thought reasoning, visual guideline generation, instructional image editing, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report.

In real-world environments, the object detection and segmentation performance can lead to a major drop, preventing the use of semantic mapping in a wider domain. On the other hand, the development of vision-language foundation models demonstrates a strong zero-shot transferability across data distribution. It provides an opportunity to construct generalizable instance-aware semantic maps. Hence, this work explores how to boost instance-aware semantic mapping from object detection generated from foundation models. We propose a probabilistic label fusion method to predict close-set semantic classes from open-set label measurements. An instance refinement module merges the over-segmented instances caused by inconsistent segmentation. We integrate all the modules into a unified semantic mapping system. Reading a sequence of RGB-D input, our work incrementally reconstructs an instance-aware semantic map. We evaluate the zero-shot performance of our method in ScanNet and SceneNN datasets. Our method achieves 40.3 mean average precision (mAP) on the ScanNet semantic instance segmentation task. It outperforms the traditional semantic mapping method significantly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE RAL</p></details> |

Our method is a generalizable feedforward model that predicts a rich neural scene representation from sparse, single-frame multi-view camera inputs with limited view overlap, and is trained self-supervised with differentiable rendering to reconstruct RGB, depth, or feature images. Our first insight is to exploit per-scene optimized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) by generating dense depth and virtual camera targets from them, which helps our model to learn enhanced 3D geometry from sparse non-overlapping image inputs. Second, to learn a semantically rich 3D representation, we propose distilling features from pre-trained 2D foundation models, such as CLIP or DINOv2, thereby enabling various downstream tasks without the need for costly 3D human annotations. To leverage these two insights, we introduce a novel model architecture with a two-stage lift-splat-shoot encoder and a parameterized sparse hierarchical voxel representation. Experimental results on the NuScenes and Waymo NOTR datasets demonstrate that DistillNeRF significantly outperforms existing comparable state-of-the-art self-supervised methods for scene reconstruction, novel view synthesis, and depth estimation; and it allows for competitive zero-shot 3D semantic occupancy prediction, as well as open-world scene understanding through distilled foundation model features.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is hard to scale up as it requires a complex reward design for each task. In contrast, language can specify tasks in a more natural way. Current foundation vision-language models (VLMs) generally require fine-tuning or other adaptations to be adopted in embodied contexts, due to the significant domain gap. However, the lack of multimodal data in such domains represents an obstacle to developing foundation models for embodied applications. In this work, we overcome these problems by presenting multimodal-foundation world models, able to connect and align the representation of foundation VLMs with the latent space of generative world models for RL, without any language annotations. The resulting agent learning framework, GenRL, allows one to specify tasks through vision and/or language prompts, ground them in the embodied domain's dynamics, and learn the corresponding behaviors in imagination. As assessed through large-scale multi-task benchmarking in locomotion and manipulation domains, GenRL enables multi-task generalization from language and visual prompts. Furthermore, by introducing a data-free policy learning strategy, our approach lays the groundwork for foundational policy learning using generative world models.

Although medical foundation models have emerged, solutions for cardiac imaging, especially echocardiography videos, are still unexplored. In this paper, we introduce EchoFM, a foundation model specifically designed to represent and analyze echocardiography videos. In EchoFM, we propose a self-supervised learning framework that captures both spatial and temporal variability patterns through a spatio-temporal consistent masking strategy and periodic-driven contrastive learning. This framework can effectively capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of echocardiography and learn the representative video features without any labels. We pre-train our model on an extensive dataset comprising over 290,000 echocardiography videos covering 26 scan views across different imaging modes, with up to 20 million frames of images. The pre-trained EchoFM can then be easily adapted and fine-tuned for a variety of downstream tasks, serving as a robust backbone model. Our evaluation was systemically designed for four downstream tasks after the echocardiography examination routine. Experiment results show that EchoFM surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including specialized echocardiography methods, self-supervised pre-training models, and general-purposed pre-trained foundation models, across all downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, how well do the models truly perform visual temporal reasoning? Our study of existing benchmarks shows that this capability of MFMs is likely overestimated as many questions can be solved by using a single, few, or out-of-order frames. To systematically examine current visual temporal reasoning tasks, we propose three principles with corresponding metrics: (1) Multi-Frame Gain, (2) Frame Order Sensitivity, and (3) Frame Information Disparity. Following these principles, we introduce TOMATO, Temporal Reasoning Multimodal Evaluation, a novel benchmark crafted to rigorously assess MFMs' temporal reasoning capabilities in video understanding. TOMATO comprises 1,484 carefully curated, human-annotated questions spanning six tasks (i.e., action count, direction, rotation, shape & trend, velocity & frequency, and visual cues), applied to 1,417 videos, including 805 self-recorded and -generated videos, that encompass human-centric, real-world, and simulated scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals a human-model performance gap of 57.3% with the best-performing model. Moreover, our in-depth analysis uncovers more fundamental limitations beyond this gap in current MFMs. While they can accurately recognize events in isolated frames, they fail to interpret these frames as a continuous sequence. We believe TOMATO will serve as a crucial testbed for evaluating the next-generation MFMs and as a call to the community to develop AI systems capable of comprehending human world dynamics through the video modality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial Channel Dependence with Channel Masks for Time Series Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23222v1)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models have been successfully extended to the time series (TS) domain, facilitated by the emergence of large-scale TS datasets. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on designing model architectures to address explicit heterogeneity among datasets such as various numbers of channels, while often overlooking implicit heterogeneity such as varying dependencies between channels. In this work, we introduce the concept of partial channel dependence (PCD), which enables a more sophisticated adjustment of channel dependencies based on dataset-specific information. To achieve PCD, we propose a channel mask that captures the relationships between channels within a dataset using two key components: 1) a correlation matrix that encodes relative dependencies between channels, and 2) domain parameters that learn the absolute dependencies specific to each dataset, refining the correlation matrix. We validate the effectiveness of PCD across four tasks in TS including forecasting, classification, imputation, and anomaly detection, under diverse settings, including few-shot and zero-shot scenarios with both TS foundation models and single-task models.

Practitioners are often reluctant to use open-source VLMs due to their significant performance lag compared to their closed-source counterparts, particularly in GUI grounding and Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios. To facilitate future research in this area, we developed OS-Atlas - a foundational GUI action model that excels at GUI grounding and OOD agentic tasks through innovations in both data and modeling. We have invested significant engineering effort in developing an open-source toolkit for synthesizing GUI grounding data across multiple platforms, including Windows, Linux, MacOS, Android, and the web. Leveraging this toolkit, we are releasing the largest open-source cross-platform GUI grounding corpus to date, which contains over 13 million GUI elements. This dataset, combined with innovations in model training, provides a solid foundation for OS-Atlas to understand GUI screenshots and generalize to unseen interfaces. Through extensive evaluation across six benchmarks spanning three different platforms (mobile, desktop, and web), OS-Atlas demonstrates significant performance improvements over previous state-of-the-art models. Our evaluation also uncovers valuable insights into continuously improving and scaling the agentic capabilities of open-source VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Code Foundation Models are Transferable Binary Analysis Knowledge Bases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19581v2)** | 2024-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-Oriented Binary Reverse Engineering (HOBRE) lies at the intersection of binary and source code, aiming to lift binary code to human-readable content relevant to source code, thereby bridging the binary-source semantic gap. Recent advancements in uni-modal code model pre-training, particularly in generative Source Code Foundation Models (SCFMs) and binary understanding models, have laid the groundwork for transfer learning applicable to HOBRE. However, existing approaches for HOBRE rely heavily on uni-modal models like SCFMs for supervised fine-tuning or general LLMs for prompting, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Inspired by recent progress in large multi-modal models, we propose that it is possible to harness the strengths of uni-modal code models from both sides to bridge the semantic gap effectively. In this paper, we introduce a novel probe-and-recover framework that incorporates a binary-source encoder-decoder model and black-box LLMs for binary analysis. Our approach leverages the pre-trained knowledge within SCFMs to synthesize relevant, symbol-rich code fragments as context. This additional context enables black-box LLMs to enhance recovery accuracy. We demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot binary summarization and binary function name recovery, with a 10.3% relative gain in CHRF and a 16.7% relative gain in a GPT4-based metric for summarization, as well as a 6.7% and 7.4% absolute increase in token-level precision and recall for name recovery, respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in automating and improving binary code analysis.</p></details> |  |

Temporal search trends have been successfully used in time series modeling across a variety of domains such as infectious diseases, unemployment rates, and retail sales. However, most existing applications require curating specialized datasets of individual keywords, queries, or query clusters, and the search data need to be temporally aligned with the outcome variable of interest. We propose a novel approach for generating an aggregated and anonymized representation of search interest as foundation features at the community level for geospatial modeling. We benchmark these features using spatial datasets across multiple domains. In zip codes with a population greater than 3000 that cover over 95% of the contiguous US population, our models for predicting missing values in a 20% set of holdout counties achieve an average $R^2$ score of 0.74 across 21 health variables, and 0.80 across 6 demographic and environmental variables. Our results demonstrate that these search features can be used for spatial predictions without strict temporal alignment, and that the resulting models outperform spatial interpolation and state of the art methods using satellite imagery features.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 8 figures, presented at the DMLR workshop at ICML 2024</p></details> |
| **[Meta-Learning Adaptable Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22264v1)** | 2024-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The power of foundation models (FMs) lies in their capacity to learn highly expressive representations that can be adapted to a broad spectrum of tasks. However, these pretrained models require multiple stages of fine-tuning to become effective for downstream applications. Conventionally, the model is first retrained on the aggregate of a diverse set of tasks of interest and then adapted to specific low-resource downstream tasks by utilizing a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) scheme. While this two-phase procedure seems reasonable, the independence of the retraining and fine-tuning phases causes a major issue, as there is no guarantee the retrained model will achieve good performance post-fine-tuning. To explicitly address this issue, we introduce a meta-learning framework infused with PEFT in this intermediate retraining stage to learn a model that can be easily adapted to unseen tasks. For our theoretical results, we focus on linear models using low-rank adaptations. In this setting, we demonstrate the suboptimality of standard retraining for finding an adaptable set of parameters. Further, we prove that our method recovers the optimally adaptable parameters. We then apply these theoretical insights to retraining the RoBERTa model to predict the continuation of conversations between different personas within the ConvAI2 dataset. Empirically, we observe significant performance benefits using our proposed meta-learning scheme during retraining relative to the conventional approach.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, current TAG approaches face two primary challenges: (i) Heavy reliance on label information and (ii) Limited cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability. These issues constrain the scaling of both data and model size, owing to high labor costs and scaling laws, complicating the development of graph foundation models with strong transferability. In this work, we propose the GraphCLIP framework to address these challenges by learning graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero/few-shot transferability through a self-supervised contrastive graph-summary pretraining method. Specifically, we generate and curate large-scale graph-summary pair data with the assistance of LLMs, and introduce a novel graph-summary pretraining method, combined with invariant learning, to enhance graph foundation models with strong cross-domain zero-shot transferability. For few-shot learning, we propose a novel graph prompt tuning technique aligned with our pretraining objective to mitigate catastrophic forgetting and minimize learning costs. Extensive experiments show the superiority of GraphCLIP in both zero-shot and few-shot settings, while evaluations across various downstream tasks confirm the versatility of GraphCLIP.

While depth and normal are geometrically related and highly complimentary, they present distinct challenges. SoTA monocular depth methods achieve zero-shot generalization by learning affine-invariant depths, which cannot recover real-world metrics. Meanwhile, SoTA normal estimation methods have limited zero-shot performance due to the lack of large-scale labeled data. To tackle these issues, we propose solutions for both metric depth estimation and surface normal estimation. For metric depth estimation, we show that the key to a zero-shot single-view model lies in resolving the metric ambiguity from various camera models and large-scale data training. We propose a canonical camera space transformation module, which explicitly addresses the ambiguity problem and can be effortlessly plugged into existing monocular models. For surface normal estimation, we propose a joint depth-normal optimization module to distill diverse data knowledge from metric depth, enabling normal estimators to learn beyond normal labels. Equipped with these modules, our depth-normal models can be stably trained with over 16 million of images from thousands of camera models with different-type annotations, resulting in zero-shot generalization to in-the-wild images with unseen camera settings. Our method enables the accurate recovery of metric 3D structures on randomly collected internet images, paving the way for plausible single-image metrology.

In the medical domain, however, the development of comprehensive foundation models is constrained by limited access to diverse modalities and stringent privacy regulations. To address these constraints, this study introduces a novel knowledge injection approach, FedKIM, designed to scale the medical foundation model within a federated learning framework. FedKIM leverages lightweight local models to extract healthcare knowledge from private data and integrates this knowledge into a centralized foundation model using a designed adaptive Multitask Multimodal Mixture Of Experts (M3OE) module. This method not only preserves privacy but also enhances the model's ability to handle complex medical tasks involving multiple modalities. Our extensive experiments across twelve tasks in seven modalities demonstrate the effectiveness of FedKIM in various settings, highlighting its potential to scale medical foundation models without direct access to sensitive data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP'24 Main</p></details> |

With the advent of foundation models (FMs), contemporary segmentation methodologies have embarked on a new epoch by either adapting FMs (e.g., CLIP, Stable Diffusion, DINO) for image segmentation or developing dedicated segmentation foundation models (e.g., SAM). These approaches not only deliver superior segmentation performance, but also herald newfound segmentation capabilities previously unseen in deep learning context. However, current research in image segmentation lacks a detailed analysis of distinct characteristics, challenges, and solutions associated with these advancements. This survey seeks to fill this gap by providing a thorough review of cutting-edge research centered around FM-driven image segmentation. We investigate two basic lines of research -- generic image segmentation (i.e., semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, panoptic segmentation), and promptable image segmentation (i.e., interactive segmentation, referring segmentation, few-shot segmentation) -- by delineating their respective task settings, background concepts, and key challenges. Furthermore, we provide insights into the emergence of segmentation knowledge from FMs like CLIP, Stable Diffusion, and DINO. An exhaustive overview of over 300 segmentation approaches is provided to encapsulate the breadth of current research efforts. Subsequently, we engage in a discussion of open issues and potential avenues for future research. We envisage that this fresh, comprehensive, and systematic survey catalyzes the evolution of advanced image segmentation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>A com...</summary><p>A comprehensive survey of image segmentation in foundation model era</p></details> |

We compare 13 feature extractor models, including ImageNet-pretrained networks, and histopathology foundation models trained on both public and proprietary data, on Rheumatoid Arthritis subtyping and Sjogren's Disease detection tasks. Using a simple Attention-Based Multiple Instance Learning classifier, we assess the transferability of learned representations from cancer H&E images to autoimmune IHC images. Contrary to expectations, histopathology-pretrained models did not significantly outperform ImageNet-pretrained models. Furthermore, there was evidence of both autoimmune feature misinterpretation and biased feature importance. Our findings highlight the challenges in transferring knowledge from cancer to autoimmune histopathology and emphasise the need for careful evaluation of AI models across diverse histopathological tasks.

| **[Variational Language Concepts for Interpreting Foundation Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03964v2)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Language Models (FLMs) such as BERT and its variants have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing. To date, the interpretability of FLMs has primarily relied on the attention weights in their self-attention layers. However, these attention weights only provide word-level interpretations, failing to capture higher-level structures, and are therefore lacking in readability and intuitiveness. To address this challenge, we first provide a formal definition of conceptual interpretation and then propose a variational Bayesian framework, dubbed VAriational Language Concept (VALC), to go beyond word-level interpretations and provide concept-level interpretations. Our theoretical analysis shows that our VALC finds the optimal language concepts to interpret FLM predictions. Empirical results on several real-world datasets show that our method can successfully provide conceptual interpretation for FLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2024 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Spread-Spectrum CDMA Communication Systems: Mathematical Foundations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21450v1)** | 2024-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes the fundamental principles and mathematical foundations of quantum spread spectrum code division multiple access (QCDMA) communication systems. The evolution of quantum signals through the direct-sequence spread spectrum multiple access communication system is carefully characterized by a novel approach called the decomposition of creation operators. In this methodology, the creation operator of the transmitted quantum signal is decomposed into the chip-time interval creation operators each of which is defined over the duration of a chip. These chip-time interval creation operators are the invariant building blocks of the spread spectrum quantum communication systems. With the aid of the proposed chip-time decomposition approach, we can find closed-form relations for quantum signals at the receiver of such a quantum communication system. Further, the paper details the principles of narrow-band filtering of quantum signals required at the receiver, a crucial step in designing and analyzing quantum communication systems. We show that by employing coherent states as the transmitted quantum signals, the inter-user interference appears as an additive term in the magnitude of the output coherent (Glauber) state, and the output of the quantum communication system is a pure quantum signal. On the other hand, if the transmitters utilize particle-like quantum signals (Fock states) such as single photon states, entanglement and a spread spectrum version of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can arise at the receivers. The important techniques developed in this paper are expected to have far-reaching implications for various applications in the exciting field of quantum communication and signal processing.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional AI methods often rely on task-specific model designs and training, which constrain both the scalability of model size and generalization across different tasks. Here, we introduce ChemFM, a large-scale foundation model specifically developed for chemistry, comprising up to 3 billion parameters. ChemFM is pre-trained on 178 million molecules using self-supervised causal language modeling to extract generalizable molecular representations. This model can be adapted to diverse downstream chemical applications using both full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. ChemFM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches across multiple chemical tasks. Notably, it achieves up to 67.48% performance improvement across 34 property prediction benchmarks, up to 33.31% reduction in mean average deviation between conditioned and actual properties of generated molecules in conditional molecular generation tasks, and up to 3.7% top-1 accuracy improvement across 4 reaction prediction datasets. Moreover, ChemFM demonstrates superior performance in predicting antibiotic activity and cytotoxicity, highlighting its potential to advance the discovery of novel antibiotics. We anticipate that ChemFM will significantly advance chemistry research by providing a foundation model capable of effectively generalizing across a broad range of tasks with minimal additional training.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models excel at acquiring human knowledge, they often struggle with decision-making in dynamic real-world environments, limiting their progress toward artificial general intelligence. This limitation underscores the importance of developing foundation agents capable of learning through autonomous environmental interactions by reinforcing existing models. Focusing on Web Browser and Phone as representative GUI scenarios, we have developed AutoGLM as a practical foundation agent system for real-world GUI interactions. Our approach integrates a comprehensive suite of techniques and infrastructures to create deployable agent systems suitable for user delivery. Through this development, we have derived two key insights: First, the design of an appropriate "intermediate interface" for GUI control is crucial, enabling the separation of planning and grounding behaviors, which require distinct optimization for flexibility and accuracy respectively. Second, we have developed a novel progressive training framework that enables self-evolving online curriculum reinforcement learning for AutoGLM. Our evaluations demonstrate AutoGLM's effectiveness across multiple domains. For web browsing, AutoGLM achieves a 55.2% success rate on VAB-WebArena-Lite (improving to 59.1% with a second attempt) and 96.2% on OpenTable evaluation tasks. In Android device control, AutoGLM attains a 36.2% success rate on AndroidLab (VAB-Mobile) and 89.7% on common tasks in popular Chinese APPs.</p></details> |  |

The main problem for those applications arises from the difficulty in collecting large labeled task-specific data for model development. Generalizable respiratory acoustic foundation models pretrained with unlabeled data would offer appealing advantages and possibly unlock this impasse. However, given the safety-critical nature of healthcare applications, it is pivotal to also ensure openness and replicability for any proposed foundation model solution. To this end, we introduce OPERA, an OPEn Respiratory Acoustic foundation model pretraining and benchmarking system, as the first approach answering this need. We curate large-scale respiratory audio datasets (~136K samples, over 400 hours), pretrain three pioneering foundation models, and build a benchmark consisting of 19 downstream respiratory health tasks for evaluation. Our pretrained models demonstrate superior performance (against existing acoustic models pretrained with general audio on 16 out of 19 tasks) and generalizability (to unseen datasets and new respiratory audio modalities). This highlights the great promise of respiratory acoustic foundation models and encourages more studies using OPERA as an open resource to accelerate research on respiratory audio for health.

Foundation models, pre-trained on vast and varied datasets, can be used in a zero-shot setting with relatively minimal data or further improved through finetuning. We compare the performance of Google's model, called TimesFM, against conventional parametric and non-parametric models, including GARCH, Generalized Autoregressive Score (GAS), and empirical quantile estimates, using daily returns from the S\&P 100 index and its constituents over 19 years. Our backtesting results indicate that in terms of the actual-over-expected ratio the fine-tuned TimesFM model consistently outperforms traditional methods. Regarding the quantile score loss function, it achieves performance comparable to the best econometric approach, the GAS model. Overall, the foundation model is either the best or among the top performers in forecasting VaR across the 0.01, 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 VaR levels. We also found that fine-tuning significantly improves the results, and the model should not be used in zero-shot settings.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often uncritically use the original diffusion formulation, which may not be optimal due to the fundamental differences between dense prediction and image generation. In this paper, we provide a systemic analysis of the diffusion formulation for the dense prediction, focusing on both quality and efficiency. And we find that the original parameterization type for image generation, which learns to predict noise, is harmful for dense prediction; the multi-step noising/denoising diffusion process is also unnecessary and challenging to optimize. Based on these insights, we introduce Lotus, a diffusion-based visual foundation model with a simple yet effective adaptation protocol for dense prediction. Specifically, Lotus is trained to directly predict annotations instead of noise, thereby avoiding harmful variance. We also reformulate the diffusion process into a single-step procedure, simplifying optimization and significantly boosting inference speed. Additionally, we introduce a novel tuning strategy called detail preserver, which achieves more accurate and fine-grained predictions. Without scaling up the training data or model capacity, Lotus achieves SoTA performance in zero-shot depth and normal estimation across various datasets. It also enhances efficiency, being significantly faster than most existing diffusion-based methods. Lotus' superior quality and efficiency also enable a wide range of practical applications, such as joint estimation, single/multi-view 3D reconstruction, etc. Project page: https://lotus3d.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first two authors contributed equally.

Such Lie symmetry groups uniquely determine their Lie symmetry algebras. Exact differential elimination algorithms have been developed to determine the dimension and structure constants of the Lie symmetry algebra of an exact polynomially nonlinear differential equation. Directly applying these symbolic algorithms to approximate models is prone to instability since these algorithms strongly depend on the orderings of the variables involved. This motivates the need to address questions at the algorithmic foundation of approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential equations. How do we define approximate Lie symmetry? How do we compute and apply approximate Lie symmetry algebras of differential equations? How reliable are the results? To address such questions, we define approximate Lie symmetry algebras in terms of exact Lie symmetry algebras of a nearby differential equation. Our algorithm for identifying these hidden approximate Lie symmetry algebras uses the SVD to find nearby rank-deficient systems combined with approximate geometric involutive forms of the approximate symmetry-defining systems. Our approach is local and depends on an input base point in the space of independent and dependent variables. In general, our local approach can yield many different nearby Lie symmetry algebras. We also outline a numerical approach to determining the approximate isomorphic of such Lie symmetry algebras as the local base point varies across a grid in the base space. We also provide a method for evaluating the reliability of our results. This enables the base space to be partitioned into regions where different local Lie symmetry algebras are admitted, separated by unstable transition regions.</p></details> |  |

Current machine learning models trained on PPG signals are mostly task-specific and lack generalizability. Previous works often used single-device datasets, did not explore out-of-domain generalization, or did not release their models, hindering reproducibility and further research. We introduce PaPaGei, the first open foundation model for PPG signals. PaPaGei is pre-trained on more than 57,000 hours of 20 million unlabeled segments of PPG signals using publicly available datasets exclusively. We evaluate against popular time-series foundation models and other benchmarks on 20 tasks of 10 diverse datasets spanning cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment. Our architecture incorporates novel representation learning approaches that leverage differences in PPG signal morphology across individuals, enabling it to capture richer representations than traditional contrastive learning methods. Across 20 tasks, PaPaGei improves classification and regression performance by an average of 6.3% and 2.9%, respectively, compared to other competitive time-series foundation models in at least 14 tasks. PaPaGei is more data- and parameter-efficient than other foundation models or methods, as it outperforms 70x larger models. Beyond accuracy, we also investigate robustness against different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for bias evaluations of future models. Notably, PaPaGei can be used out of the box as both a feature extractor and an encoder for other multimodal models, opening up new opportunities for multimodal health monitoring</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models: https://github.com/nokia-bell-labs/papagei-foundation-model</p></details> |

Moreover, robot policies that follow natural language instructions are typically trained on either templated language or expensive human-labeled instructions, hindering their scalability. To this end, we introduce NILS: Natural language Instruction Labeling for Scalability. NILS automatically labels uncurated, long-horizon robot data at scale in a zero-shot manner without any human intervention. NILS combines pretrained vision-language foundation models in order to detect objects in a scene, detect object-centric changes, segment tasks from large datasets of unlabelled interaction data and ultimately label behavior datasets. Evaluations on BridgeV2, Fractal, and a kitchen play dataset show that NILS can autonomously annotate diverse robot demonstrations of unlabeled and unstructured datasets while alleviating several shortcomings of crowdsourced human annotations, such as low data quality and diversity. We use NILS to label over 115k trajectories obtained from over 430 hours of robot data.

Meanwhile, recent breakthroughs in large Foundation Models (FMs) have expanded AI's potential across many domains due to their exceptional generalizability and zero-shot transfer capabilities. However, their success has largely been confined to natural data like images and video, with degraded performance and even failures for RS data of various non-optical modalities. This has inspired growing interest in developing Remote Sensing Foundation Models (RSFMs) to address the complex demands of Earth Observation (EO) tasks, spanning the surface, atmosphere, and oceans. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of RSFMs. It begins with an outline of their motivation and background, followed by an introduction of their foundational concepts. It then categorizes and reviews existing RSFM studies including their datasets and technical contributions across Visual Foundation Models (VFMs), Visual-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and beyond.

Scaling models to billions of parameters has been shown to yield unprecedented benefits including emergent abilities, but requires data scaling and computing resources typically not available outside industry R&D labs. In this work, we pair high-performance computing resources including Frontier supercomputer, America's first exascale system, and high-resolution optical RS data to pretrain billion-scale FMs. Our study assesses performance of different pretrained variants of vision Transformers across image classification, semantic segmentation and object detection benchmarks, which highlight the importance of data scaling for effective model scaling. Moreover, we discuss construction of a novel TIU pretraining dataset, model initialization, with data and pretrained models intended for public release. By discussing technical challenges and details often lacking in the related literature, this work is intended to offer best practices to the geospatial community toward efficient training and benchmarking of larger FMs.</p></details> |  |

Molecular representation is key to building such models. Previous works have typically focused on a single representation or view of the molecules. Here, we develop a multi-view foundation model approach, that integrates molecular views of graph, image and text. Single-view foundation models are each pre-trained on a dataset of up to 200M molecules and then aggregated into combined representations. Our multi-view model is validated on a diverse set of 18 tasks, encompassing ligand-protein binding, molecular solubility, metabolism and toxicity. We show that the multi-view models perform robustly and are able to balance the strengths and weaknesses of specific views. We then apply this model to screen compounds against a large (>100 targets) set of G Protein-Coupled receptors (GPCRs). From this library of targets, we identify 33 that are related to Alzheimer's disease. On this subset, we employ our model to identify strong binders, which are validated through structure-based modeling and identification of key binding motifs.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages including supplement. 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

However, their application on object detection is largely overlooked, especially without fine-tuning them. In this work, we show that frozen foundation models can be a versatile feature enhancer, even though they are not pre-trained for object detection. Specifically, we explore directly transferring the high-level image understanding of foundation models to detectors in the following two ways. First, the class token in foundation models provides an in-depth understanding of the complex scene, which facilitates decoding object queries in the detector's decoder by providing a compact context. Additionally, the patch tokens in foundation models can enrich the features in the detector's encoder by providing semantic details. Utilizing frozen foundation models as plug-and-play modules rather than the commonly used backbone can significantly enhance the detector's performance while preventing the problems caused by the architecture discrepancy between the detector's backbone and the foundation model. With such a novel paradigm, we boost the SOTA query-based detector DINO from 49.0% AP to 51.9% AP (+2.9% AP) and further to 53.8% AP (+4.8% AP) by integrating one or two foundation models respectively, on the COCO validation set after training for 12 epochs with R50 as the detector's backbone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Furthermore, we jointly profile FMs' efficacy and efficiency when adapting to general video understanding tasks using cost measurements during both training and inference. Our main findings areas follows. First, task-specialized models significantly outperform the seven FMs studied in this work, in sharp contrast to what FMs have achieved in natural language and image understanding. Second, video-native FMs, whose pretraining data mainly contains the video modality, are generally better than image-native FMs in classifying motion-rich videos, localizing actions in time, and understanding a video of more than one action. Third, the video-native FMs can perform well on video tasks under light adaptations to downstream tasks (e.g., freezing the FM backbones), while image-native FMs win in full end-to-end finetuning. The first two observations reveal the need and tremendous opportunities to conduct research on video-focused FMs, and the last confirms that both tasks and adaptation methods matter when it comes to the evaluation of FMs. Our code is released under: https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/official/projects/videoglue.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |

The diverse nature of echo images, including variations in probe types, manufacturers, and pathologies, poses challenges for developing artificial intelligent models that can generalize across different clinical practice. We introduce EchoApex, the first general-purpose vision foundation model echocardiography with applications on a variety of clinical practice. Leveraging self-supervised learning, EchoApex is pretrained on over 20 million echo images from 11 clinical centres. By incorporating task-specific decoders and adapter modules, we demonstrate the effectiveness of EchoApex on 4 different kind of clinical applications with 28 sub-tasks, including view classification, interactive structure segmentation, left ventricle hypertrophy detection and automated ejection fraction estimation from view sequences. Compared to state-of-the-art task-specific models, EchoApex attains improved performance with a unified image encoding architecture, demonstrating the benefits of model pretraining at scale with in-domain data. Furthermore, EchoApex illustrates the potential for developing a general-purpose vision foundation model tailored specifically for echocardiography, capable of addressing a diverse range of clinical applications with high efficiency and efficacy.</p></details> |  |

Most methods rely on spotting them by analysing misclassified samples, in a semi-automated human-computer validation. In contrast, we propose ConceptDrift, a method which analyzes the weights of a linear probe, learned on top a foundational model. We capitalize on the weight update trajectory, which starts from the embedding of the textual representation of the class, and proceeds to drift towards embeddings that disclose hidden biases. Different from prior work, with this approach we can pin-point unwanted correlations from a dataset, providing more than just possible explanations for the wrong predictions. We empirically prove the efficacy of our method, by significantly improving zero-shot performance with biased-augmented prompting. Our method is not bounded to a single modality, and we experiment in this work with both image (Waterbirds, CelebA, Nico++) and text datasets (CivilComments).</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the Performance of Foundation Models via Agreement-on-the-Line](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01542v2)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the out-of-distribution performance in regimes where labels are scarce is critical to safely deploy foundation models. Recently, it was shown that ensembles of neural networks observe the phenomena "agreement-on-the-line", which can be leveraged to reliably predict OOD performance without labels. However, in contrast to classical neural networks that are trained on in-distribution data from scratch for numerous epochs, foundation models undergo minimal finetuning from heavily pretrained weights, which may reduce the ensemble diversity needed to observe agreement-on-the-line. In our work, we demonstrate that when lightly finetuning multiple runs from a single foundation model, the choice of randomness during training (linear head initialization, data ordering, and data subsetting) can lead to drastically different levels of agreement-on-the-line in the resulting ensemble. Surprisingly, only random head initialization is able to reliably induce agreement-on-the-line in finetuned foundation models across vision and language benchmarks. Second, we demonstrate that ensembles of multiple foundation models pretrained on different datasets but finetuned on the same task can also show agreement-on-the-line. In total, by careful construction of a diverse ensemble, we can utilize agreement-on-the-line-based methods to predict the OOD performance of foundation models with high precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[ONCOPILOT: A Promptable CT Foundation Model For Solid Tumor Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07908v3)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Carcinogenesis is a proteiform phenomenon, with tumors emerging in various locations and displaying complex, diverse shapes. At the crucial intersection of research and clinical practice, it demands precise and flexible assessment. However, current biomarkers, such as RECIST 1.1's long and short axis measurements, fall short of capturing this complexity, offering an approximate estimate of tumor burden and a simplistic representation of a more intricate process. Additionally, existing supervised AI models face challenges in addressing the variability in tumor presentations, limiting their clinical utility. These limitations arise from the scarcity of annotations and the models' focus on narrowly defined tasks. To address these challenges, we developed ONCOPILOT, an interactive radiological foundation model trained on approximately 7,500 CT scans covering the whole body, from both normal anatomy and a wide range of oncological cases. ONCOPILOT performs 3D tumor segmentation using visual prompts like point-click and bounding boxes, outperforming state-of-the-art models (e.g., nnUnet) and achieving radiologist-level accuracy in RECIST 1.1 measurements. The key advantage of this foundation model is its ability to surpass state-of-the-art performance while keeping the radiologist in the loop, a capability that previous models could not achieve. When radiologists interactively refine the segmentations, accuracy improves further. ONCOPILOT also accelerates measurement processes and reduces inter-reader variability, facilitating volumetric analysis and unlocking new biomarkers for deeper insights. This AI assistant is expected to enhance the precision of RECIST 1.1 measurements, unlock the potential of volumetric biomarkers, and improve patient stratification and clinical care, while seamlessly integrating into the radiological workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedBaF: Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18352v1)** | 2024-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models are now a major focus of leading technology organizations due to their ability to generalize across diverse tasks. Existing approaches for adapting foundation models to new applications often rely on Federated Learning (FL) and disclose the foundation model weights to clients when using it to initialize the global model. While these methods ensure client data privacy, they compromise model and information security. In this paper, we introduce Federated Learning Aggregation Biased by a Foundation Model (FedBaF), a novel method for dynamically integrating pre-trained foundation model weights during the FL aggregation phase. Unlike conventional methods, FedBaF preserves the confidentiality of the foundation model while still leveraging its power to train more accurate models, especially in non-IID and adversarial scenarios. Our comprehensive experiments use Pre-ResNet and foundation models like Vision Transformer to demonstrate that FedBaF not only matches, but often surpasses the test accuracy of traditional weight initialization methods by up to 11.4\% in IID and up to 15.8\% in non-IID settings. Additionally, FedBaF applied to a Transformer-based language model significantly reduced perplexity by up to 39.2\%.</p></details> |  |

Techniques leveraging in-context learning (ICL) have shown promise here, allowing for dynamic adaptation to unseen data. ICL can provide predictions for entirely new datasets without further training or hyperparameter tuning, therefore providing very fast inference when encountering a novel task. However, scaling ICL for tabular data remains an issue: approaches based on large language models cannot efficiently process numeric tables, and tabular-specific techniques have not been able to effectively harness the power of real data to improve performance and generalization. We are able to overcome these challenges by training tabular-specific ICL-based architectures on real data with self-supervised learning and retrieval, combining the best of both worlds. Our resulting model -- the Tabular Discriminative Pre-trained Transformer (TabDPT) -- achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CC18 (classification) and CTR23 (regression) benchmarks with no task-specific fine-tuning, demonstrating the adapatability and speed of ICL once the model is pre-trained. TabDPT also demonstrates strong scaling as both model size and amount of available data increase, pointing towards future improvements simply through the curation of larger tabular pre-training datasets and training larger models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minim...</summary><p>Minimal TabDPT interface to provide predictions on new datasets available at the following link: https://github.com/layer6ai-labs/TabDPT</p></details> |

Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks, eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based autoregressive framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/mit-han-lab/vila-u.

It includes tasks for instance classification, character recognition, token prediction, and text generation.

Accurate modeling of real-world chemical reactors through first-principles is often challenging, and the process of rebuilding and retraining models for each new chemical process is inefficient. This raises a critical question: can we develop a single, universal neural network (i.e., a foundation model) that can rapidly adapt to any new chemical process in a reactor? To address this, we propose a foundation model for chemical reactor modeling that employs a meta-learning approach, followed by physics-informed fine-tuning on new tasks with only a few data samples. Our model is designed to generalize across three classic reactor types: continuous stirred tank reactors, batch reactors, and plug flow reactors. Compared to conventional methods such as data-driven learning, physics-informed learning, transfer learning, and meta-learning, our approach demonstrates superior performance in few-shot scenarios. Specifically, it shows rapid adaptation to unseen reactions with varying integer orders across different reactor set-ups, requiring minimal data for fine-tuning.

| **[Securing Federated Learning Against Novel and Classic Backdoor Threats During Foundation Model Integration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17573v1)** | 2024-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated learning (FL) enables decentralized model training while preserving privacy. Recently, integrating Foundation Models (FMs) into FL has boosted performance but also introduced a novel backdoor attack mechanism. Attackers can exploit the FM's capabilities to embed backdoors into synthetic data generated by FMs used for model fusion, subsequently infecting all client models through knowledge sharing without involvement in the long-lasting FL process. These novel attacks render existing FL backdoor defenses ineffective, as they primarily detect anomalies among client updates, which may appear uniformly malicious under this attack. Our work proposes a novel data-free defense strategy by constraining abnormal activations in the hidden feature space during model aggregation on the server. The activation constraints, optimized using synthetic data alongside FL training, mitigate the attack while barely affecting model performance, as the parameters remain untouched. Extensive experiments demonstrate its effectiveness against both novel and classic backdoor attacks, outperforming existing defenses while maintaining model performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet great concerns have been raised about their mythic and uninterpreted potentials not only in machine learning, but also in various other disciplines. In this position paper, we propose to identify a neglected issue deeply rooted in LFMs: Catastrophic Inheritance, describing the weaknesses and limitations inherited from biased large-scale pre-training data to behaviors of LFMs on the downstream tasks, including samples that are corrupted, long-tailed, noisy, out-of-distributed, to name a few. Such inheritance can potentially cause catastrophes to downstream applications, such as bias, lack of generalization, deteriorated performance, security vulnerability, privacy leakage, and value misalignment. We discuss the challenges behind this issue and propose UIM, a framework to Understand the catastrophic inheritance of LFMs from both pre-training and downstream adaptation, Interpret the implications of catastrophic inheritance on downstream tasks, and how to Mitigate it. UIM aims to unite both the machine learning and social sciences communities for more responsible and promising AI development and deployment.</p></details> | Accepted by DMLR |

However, there are significant challenges that hinder the optimal use of multimodal e-commerce data by foundation models: (1) the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality multimodal benchmark datasets; and (2) the lack of effective multimodal information integration methods. To address these challenges, in this paper, we introduce MMECInstruct, the first-ever, large-scale, and high-quality multimodal instruction dataset for e-commerce. We also develop CASLIE, a simple, lightweight, yet effective framework for integrating multimodal information for e-commerce. Leveraging MMECInstruct, we fine-tune a series of e-commerce MFMs within CASLIE, denoted as CASLIE models.

However, a critical issue remains: the lack of a comprehensive evaluation framework capable of assessing the quality and scientific validity of model outputs. To address this issue, we develop ClimaGen (Climate QA Generator), an automated algorithmic framework that generates question-answer pairs from graduate textbooks with climate scientists in the loop. As a result, we present ClimaQA-Gold, an expert-annotated benchmark dataset alongside ClimaQA-Silver, a large-scale, comprehensive synthetic QA dataset for climate science.

This question cannot be answered by the existing theory of representation, optimization or generalization, because the issues they mainly investigate are assumed to be nonexistent here. In this paper, we show that category theory provides powerful machinery to answer this question. We have proved three results. The first one limits the power of prompt-based learning, saying that the model can solve a downstream task with prompts if and only if the task is representable. The second one says fine tuning does not have this limit, as a foundation model with the minimum required power (up to symmetry) can theoretically solve downstream tasks for the category defined by pretext task, with fine tuning and enough resources. Our final result can be seen as a new type of generalization theorem, showing that the foundation model can generate unseen objects from the target category (e.g., images) using the structural information from the source category (e.g., texts). Along the way, we provide a categorical framework for supervised and self-supervised learning, which might be of independent interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML'...</summary><p>ICML'23.

In this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4 and Claude 2.1 (Gemini Pro and LLAMA 2 did not generate valid results) are moral hypocrites. We employ two research instruments based on the Moral Foundations Theory: (i) the Moral Foundations Questionnaire (MFQ), which investigates which values are considered morally relevant in abstract moral judgements; and (ii) the Moral Foundations Vignettes (MFVs), which evaluate moral cognition in concrete scenarios related to each moral foundation. We characterise conflicts in values between these different abstractions of moral evaluation as hypocrisy.

As sensors for these signals become more common, improving machine learning methods for multimodal healthcare data is crucial. Pretraining foundation models is a promising avenue for success. However, methods for developing foundation models in healthcare are still in early exploration and it is unclear which pretraining strategies are most effective given the diversity of physiological signals. This is partly due to challenges in multimodal health data: obtaining data across many patients is difficult and costly, there is a lot of inter-subject variability, and modalities are often heterogeneously informative across downstream tasks. Here, we explore these challenges in the PhysioNet 2018 dataset. We use a masked autoencoding objective to pretrain a multimodal model. We show that the model learns representations that can be linearly probed for a diverse set of downstream tasks. We hypothesize that cross-modal reconstruction objectives are important for successful multimodal training, as they encourage the model to integrate information across modalities. We demonstrate that modality dropout in the input space improves performance across downstream tasks. We also find that late-fusion models pretrained with contrastive learning objectives are less effective across multiple tasks. Finally, we analyze the model's representations, showing that attention weights become more cross-modal and temporally aligned with our pretraining strategy. The learned embeddings also become more distributed in terms of the modalities encoded by each unit. Overall, our work demonstrates the utility of multimodal foundation models with health data, even across diverse physiological data sources. We further argue that explicit methods for inducing cross-modality may enhance multimodal pretraining strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2024 AIM-FM Workshop</p></details> |

However, they often struggle to adapt to specific tasks. Reinforcement learning (RL), which allows agents to learn through interaction and feedback, offers a compelling solution. Integrating RL with FMs enables these models to achieve desired outcomes and excel at particular tasks. Additionally, RL can be enhanced by leveraging the reasoning and generalization capabilities of FMs. This synergy is revolutionizing various fields, including robotics. FMs, rich in knowledge and generalization, provide robots with valuable information, while RL facilitates learning and adaptation through real-world interactions. This survey paper comprehensively explores this exciting intersection, examining how these paradigms can be integrated to advance robotic intelligence. We analyze the use of foundation models as action planners, the development of robotics-specific foundation models, and the mutual benefits of combining FMs with RL. Furthermore, we present a taxonomy of integration approaches, including large language models, vision-language models, diffusion models, and transformer-based RL models. We also explore how RL can utilize world representations learned from FMs to enhance robotic task execution. Our survey aims to synthesize current research and highlight key challenges in robotic reasoning and control, particularly in the context of integrating FMs and RL--two rapidly evolving technologies. By doing so, we seek to spark future research and emphasize critical areas that require further investigation to enhance robotics.

However, adapting these models to various downstream tasks remains challenging, particularly when faced with datasets from different sources and acquisition conditions, as well as limited data availability. In this study, we benchmark four pathology-specific foundation models across 14 datasets and two scenarios-consistency assessment and flexibility assessment-addressing diverse adaptation scenarios and downstream tasks. In the consistency assessment scenario, involving five fine-tuning methods, we found that the parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach was both efficient and effective for adapting pathology-specific foundation models to diverse datasets within the same downstream task. In the flexibility assessment scenario under data-limited environments, utilizing five few-shot learning methods, we observed that the foundation models benefited more from the few-shot learning methods that involve modification during the testing phase only. These findings provide insights that could guide the deployment of pathology-specific foundation models in real clinical settings, potentially improving the accuracy and reliability of pathology image analysis.

However, a significant challenge arises when adapting these models to domain-specific fields, such as digital pathology, due to substantial gaps between domains. To address this limitation, foundation models (FM) have been trained on large-scale in-domain datasets to learn the intricate features of histopathology images. In cancer diagnosis, whole-slide image (WSI) prediction is essential for patient prognosis, and multiple instance learning (MIL) has been implemented to handle the giga-pixel size of WSI.

| **[DARES: Depth Anything in Robotic Endoscopic Surgery with Self-supervised Vector-LoRA of the Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17433v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) relies on accurate depth estimation for 3D reconstruction and visualization. While foundation models like Depth Anything Models (DAM) show promise, directly applying them to surgery often yields suboptimal results. Fully fine-tuning on limited surgical data can cause overfitting and catastrophic forgetting, compromising model robustness and generalization. Although Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) addresses some adaptation issues, its uniform parameter distribution neglects the inherent feature hierarchy, where earlier layers, learning more general features, require more parameters than later ones. To tackle this issue, we introduce Depth Anything in Robotic Endoscopic Surgery (DARES), a novel approach that employs a new adaptation technique, Vector Low-Rank Adaptation (Vector-LoRA) on the DAM V2 to perform self-supervised monocular depth estimation in RAS scenes. To enhance learning efficiency, we introduce Vector-LoRA by integrating more parameters in earlier layers and gradually decreasing parameters in later layers. We also design a reprojection loss based on the multi-scale SSIM error to enhance depth perception by better tailoring the foundation model to the specific requirements of the surgical environment. The proposed method is validated on the SCARED dataset and demonstrates superior performance over recent state-of-the-art self-supervised monocular depth estimation techniques, achieving an improvement of 13.3% in the absolute relative error metric. The code and pre-trained weights are available at https://github.com/mobarakol/DARES.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[An Electrocardiogram Foundation Model Built on over 10 Million Recordings with External Evaluation across Multiple Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04133v2)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence (AI) has demonstrated significant potential in ECG analysis and cardiovascular disease assessment. Recently, foundation models have played a remarkable role in advancing medical AI. The development of an ECG foundation model holds the promise of elevating AI-ECG research to new heights. However, building such a model faces several challenges, including insufficient database sample sizes and inadequate generalization across multiple domains. Additionally, there is a notable performance gap between single-lead and multi-lead ECG analyses. We introduced an ECG Foundation Model (ECGFounder), a general-purpose model that leverages real-world ECG annotations from cardiology experts to broaden the diagnostic capabilities of ECG analysis. ECGFounder was trained on over 10 million ECGs with 150 label categories from the Harvard-Emory ECG Database, enabling comprehensive cardiovascular disease diagnosis through ECG analysis. The model is designed to be both an effective out-of-the-box solution, and a to be fine-tunable for downstream tasks, maximizing usability. Importantly, we extended its application to lower rank ECGs, and arbitrary single-lead ECGs in particular. ECGFounder is applicable to supporting various downstream tasks in mobile monitoring scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ECGFounder achieves expert-level performance on internal validation sets, with AUROC exceeding 0.95 for eighty diagnoses. It also shows strong classification performance and generalization across various diagnoses on external validation sets. When fine-tuned, ECGFounder outperforms baseline models in demographic analysis, clinical event detection, and cross-modality cardiac rhythm diagnosis. The trained model and data will be publicly released upon publication through the bdsp.io. Our code is available at https://github.com/bdsp-core/ECGFounder</p></details> | working in progress |

SeisLM is pretrained on a large collection of open-source seismic datasets using a self-supervised contrastive loss, akin to BERT in language modeling. This approach allows the model to learn general seismic waveform patterns from unlabeled data without being tied to specific downstream tasks. When fine-tuned, SeisLM excels in seismological tasks like event detection, phase-picking, onset time regression, and foreshock-aftershock classification. The code has been made publicly available on https://github.com/liutianlin0121/seisLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[PointSeg: A Training-Free Paradigm for 3D Scene Segmentation via Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06403v4)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent success of vision foundation models have shown promising performance for the 2D perception tasks. However, it is difficult to train a 3D foundation network directly due to the limited dataset and it remains under explored whether existing foundation models can be lifted to 3D space seamlessly. In this paper, we present PointSeg, a novel training-free paradigm that leverages off-the-shelf vision foundation models to address 3D scene perception tasks. PointSeg can segment anything in 3D scene by acquiring accurate 3D prompts to align their corresponding pixels across frames. Concretely, we design a two-branch prompts learning structure to construct the 3D point-box prompts pairs, combining with the bidirectional matching strategy for accurate point and proposal prompts generation. Then, we perform the iterative post-refinement adaptively when cooperated with different vision foundation models. Moreover, we design a affinity-aware merging algorithm to improve the final ensemble masks. PointSeg demonstrates impressive segmentation performance across various datasets, all without training. Specifically, our approach significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art specialist training-free model by 14.1$\%$, 12.3$\%$, and 12.6$\%$ mAP on ScanNet, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 datasets, respectively. On top of that, PointSeg can incorporate with various foundation models and even surpasses the specialist training-based methods by 3.4$\%$-5.4$\%$ mAP across various datasets, serving as an effective generalist model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning Foundation Models for High Accuracy without Retraining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15567v1)** | 2024-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the superior performance, it is challenging to deploy foundation models or large language models (LLMs) due to their massive parameters and computations. While pruning is a promising technique to reduce model size and accelerate the inference, the traditional pruning techniques can hardly be applied for LLMs as they need to finetune the model on the full dataset with multiple epochs consuming massive data and hardware resources. To deal with this problem, post-training pruning methods are proposed to prune LLMs in one-shot without retraining. However, their accuracy after pruning may suffer from certain performance degradation due to the lack of retraining with massive data. To address this issue, in this paper, we first formulate the post-training problem for layer-wise LLM compression to simultaneously prune multiple weights in LLMs. Next, we provide an optimal solution for this problem and design our post-training pruning algorithm for both unstructured and semi-structured sparsity. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed methods in comparison to SOTA baselines across various LLM families including transformer-based LLMs and Mamba-based LLMs. Code link: https://github.com/piuzha/APT</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2024 findings</p></details> |

Previous investigations in medical images have often been constrained to specific anatomical regions, particular applications, and limited datasets, resulting in isolated diffusion models. This paper introduces a diffusion-based foundation model to address a diverse range of medical image tasks, namely MedDiff-FM. MedDiff-FM leverages 3D CT images from multiple publicly available datasets, covering anatomical regions from head to abdomen, to pre-train a diffusion foundation model, and explores the capabilities of the diffusion foundation model across a variety of application scenarios. The diffusion foundation model handles multi-level image processing both at the image-level and patch-level, and utilizes position embedding to establish multi-level spatial relationships as well as anatomical structures and region classes to control certain anatomical regions. MedDiff-FM manages several downstream tasks seamlessly, including image denoising, anomaly detection, and image synthesis. MedDiff-FM is also capable of performing lesion generation and lesion inpainting by rapidly fine-tuning the diffusion foundation model using ControlNet with task-specific conditions. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of MedDiff-FM in addressing diverse downstream medical image tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FoMo: A Foundation Model for Mobile Traffic Forecasting with Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15322v1)** | 2024-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile traffic forecasting allows operators to anticipate network dynamics and performance in advance, offering substantial potential for enhancing service quality and improving user experience. However, existing models are often task-oriented and are trained with tailored data, which limits their effectiveness in diverse mobile network tasks of Base Station (BS) deployment, resource allocation, energy optimization, etc. and hinders generalization across different urban environments. Foundation models have made remarkable strides across various domains of NLP and CV due to their multi-tasking adaption and zero/few-shot learning capabilities. In this paper, we propose an innovative Foundation model for Mo}bile traffic forecasting (FoMo), aiming to handle diverse forecasting tasks of short/long-term predictions and distribution generation across multiple cities to support network planning and optimization. FoMo combines diffusion models and transformers, where various spatio-temporal masks are proposed to enable FoMo to learn intrinsic features of different tasks, and a contrastive learning strategy is developed to capture the correlations between mobile traffic and urban contexts, thereby improving its transfer learning capability. Extensive experiments on 9 real-world datasets demonstrate that FoMo outperforms current models concerning diverse forecasting tasks and zero/few-shot learning, showcasing a strong universality. We further deploy the FoMo on the JiuTian optimization platform of China Mobile, where we use the predicted mobile data to formulate network planning and optimization applications, including BS deployment, resource block scheduling, and BS sleep control.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |
| **[A General-Purpose Multimodal Foundation Model for Dermatology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15038v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosing and treating skin diseases require advanced visual skills across multiple domains and the ability to synthesize information from various imaging modalities. Current deep learning models, while effective at specific tasks such as diagnosing skin cancer from dermoscopic images, fall short in addressing the complex, multimodal demands of clinical practice. Here, we introduce PanDerm, a multimodal dermatology foundation model pretrained through self-supervised learning on a dataset of over 2 million real-world images of skin diseases, sourced from 11 clinical institutions across 4 imaging modalities. We evaluated PanDerm on 28 diverse datasets covering a range of clinical tasks, including skin cancer screening, phenotype assessment and risk stratification, diagnosis of neoplastic and inflammatory skin diseases, skin lesion segmentation, change monitoring, and metastasis prediction and prognosis. PanDerm achieved state-of-the-art performance across all evaluated tasks, often outperforming existing models even when using only 5-10% of labeled data. PanDerm's clinical utility was demonstrated through reader studies in real-world clinical settings across multiple imaging modalities. It outperformed clinicians by 10.2% in early-stage melanoma detection accuracy and enhanced clinicians' multiclass skin cancer diagnostic accuracy by 11% in a collaborative human-AI setting. Additionally, PanDerm demonstrated robust performance across diverse demographic factors, including different body locations, age groups, genders, and skin tones. The strong results in benchmark evaluations and real-world clinical scenarios suggest that PanDerm could enhance the management of skin diseases and serve as a model for developing multimodal foundation models in other medical specialties, potentially accelerating the integration of AI support in healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>56 pa...</summary><p>56 pages; Technical report</p></details> |

However, these claims have not been thoroughly analyzed yet. Recently, foundation models have demonstrated unparalleled capabilities across diverse domains from language to computer vision, marking them as a potential cornerstone of future research for a multitude of computational tasks. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical study on representation learning for downstream Visual Question Answering (VQA), which requires an accurate compositional understanding of the scene. We thoroughly investigate the benefits and trade-offs of OC models and alternative approaches including large pre-trained foundation models on both synthetic and real-world data, and demonstrate a viable way to achieve the best of both worlds. The extensiveness of our study, encompassing over 600 downstream VQA models and 15 different types of upstream representations, also provides several additional insights that we believe will be of interest to the community at large.</p></details> |  |
| **[LangGFM: A Large Language Model Alone Can be a Powerful Graph Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14961v1)** | 2024-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently gained significant attention. However, the unique data processing and evaluation setups employed by different studies hinder a deeper understanding of their progress. Additionally, current research tends to focus on specific subsets of graph learning tasks, such as structural tasks, node-level tasks, or classification tasks. As a result, they often incorporate specialized modules tailored to particular task types, losing their applicability to other graph learning tasks and contradicting the original intent of foundation models to be universal. Therefore, to enhance consistency, coverage, and diversity across domains, tasks, and research interests within the graph learning community in the evaluation of GFMs, we propose GFMBench-a systematic and comprehensive benchmark comprising 26 datasets. Moreover, we introduce LangGFM, a novel GFM that relies entirely on large language models. By revisiting and exploring the effective graph textualization principles, as well as repurposing successful techniques from graph augmentation and graph self-supervised learning within the language space, LangGFM achieves performance on par with or exceeding the state of the art across GFMBench, which can offer us new perspectives, experiences, and baselines to drive forward the evolution of GFMs.</p></details> | under review |

The core idea is to formulate a logifold structure and to interpret network models with restricted domains as local charts of datasets. In particular, this provides a mathematical foundation for ensemble machine learning. Our experiments demonstrate that logifolds can be implemented to identify fuzzy domains and improve accuracy compared to taking average of model outputs. Additionally, we provide a theoretical example of a logifold, highlighting the importance of restricting to domains of classifiers in an ensemble.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Mind the Gap: Foundation Models and the Covert Proliferation of Military Intelligence, Surveillance, and Targeting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14831v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discussions regarding the dual use of foundation models and the risks they pose have overwhelmingly focused on a narrow set of use cases and national security directives-in particular, how AI may enable the efficient construction of a class of systems referred to as CBRN: chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons. The overwhelming focus on these hypothetical and narrow themes has occluded a much-needed conversation regarding present uses of AI for military systems, specifically ISTAR: intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance. These are the uses most grounded in actual deployments of AI that pose life-or-death stakes for civilians, where misuses and failures pose geopolitical consequences and military escalations. This is particularly underscored by novel proliferation risks specific to the widespread availability of commercial models and the lack of effective approaches that reliably prevent them from contributing to ISTAR capabilities. In this paper, we outline the significant national security concerns emanating from current and envisioned uses of commercial foundation models outside of CBRN contexts, and critique the narrowing of the policy debate that has resulted from a CBRN focus (e.g. compute thresholds, model weight release). We demonstrate that the inability to prevent personally identifiable information from contributing to ISTAR capabilities within commercial foundation models may lead to the use and proliferation of military AI technologies by adversaries. We also show how the usage of foundation models within military settings inherently expands the attack vectors of military systems and the defense infrastructures they interface with. We conclude that in order to secure military systems and limit the proliferation of AI armaments, it may be necessary to insulate military AI systems and personal data from commercial foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Swiss Army Knife: Synergizing Biases in Knowledge from Vision Foundation Models for Multi-Task Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14633v1)** | 2024-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance on numerous downstream tasks. However, due to their inherent representation biases originating from different training paradigms, VFMs exhibit advantages and disadvantages across distinct vision tasks. Although amalgamating the strengths of multiple VFMs for downstream tasks is an intuitive strategy, effectively exploiting these biases remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose a novel and versatile "Swiss Army Knife" (SAK) solution, which adaptively distills knowledge from a committee of VFMs to enhance multi-task learning. Unlike existing methods that use a single backbone for knowledge transfer, our approach preserves the unique representation bias of each teacher by collaborating the lightweight Teacher-Specific Adapter Path modules with the Teacher-Agnostic Stem. Through dynamic selection and combination of representations with Mixture-of-Representations Routers, our SAK is capable of synergizing the complementary strengths of multiple VFMs. Extensive experiments show that our SAK remarkably outperforms prior state of the arts in multi-task learning by 10% on the NYUD-v2 benchmark, while also providing a flexible and robust framework that can readily accommodate more advanced model designs.</p></details> |  |
