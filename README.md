| **[WEEP: A method for spatial interpretation of weakly supervised CNN models in computational pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15238v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning enables the modelling of high-resolution histopathology whole-slide images (WSI). Weakly supervised learning of tile-level data is typically applied for tasks where labels only exist on the patient or WSI level (e.g. patient outcomes or histological grading). In this context, there is a need for improved spatial interpretability of predictions from such models. We propose a novel method, Wsi rEgion sElection aPproach (WEEP), for model interpretation. It provides a principled yet straightforward way to establish the spatial area of WSI required for assigning a particular prediction label. We demonstrate WEEP on a binary classification task in the area of breast cancer computational pathology. WEEP is easy to implement, is directly connected to the model-based decision process, and offers information relevant to both research and diagnostic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Spatial Inconsistency in Classifier-Free Diffusion Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05384v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been widely used in text-to-image diffusion models, where the CFG scale is introduced to control the strength of text guidance on the whole image space. However, we argue that a global CFG scale results in spatial inconsistency on varying semantic strengths and suboptimal image quality. To address this problem, we present a novel approach, Semantic-aware Classifier-Free Guidance (S-CFG), to customize the guidance degrees for different semantic units in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, we first design a training-free semantic segmentation method to partition the latent image into relatively independent semantic regions at each denoising step. In particular, the cross-attention map in the denoising U-net backbone is renormalized for assigning each patch to the corresponding token, while the self-attention map is used to complete the semantic regions. Then, to balance the amplification of diverse semantic units, we adaptively adjust the CFG scales across different semantic regions to rescale the text guidance degrees into a uniform level. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of S-CFG over the original CFG strategy on various text-to-image diffusion models, without requiring any extra training cost. our codes are available at https://github.com/SmilesDZgk/S-CFG.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by CVPR-2024</p></details> |
| **[SegForestNet: Spatial-Partitioning-Based Aerial Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01585v3)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial image segmentation is the basis for applications such as automatically creating maps or tracking deforestation. In true orthophotos, which are often used in these applications, many objects and regions can be approximated well by polygons. However, this fact is rarely exploited by state-of-the-art semantic segmentation models. Instead, most models allow unnecessary degrees of freedom in their predictions by allowing arbitrary region shapes. We therefore present a refinement of our deep learning model which predicts binary space partitioning trees, an efficient polygon representation. The refinements include a new feature decoder architecture and a new differentiable BSP tree renderer which both avoid vanishing gradients. Additionally, we designed a novel loss function specifically designed to improve the spatial partitioning defined by the predicted trees. Furthermore, our expanded model can predict multiple trees at once and thus can predict class-specific segmentations. As an additional contribution, we investigate the impact of a non-optimal training process in comparison to an optimized training process. While model architectures optimized for aerial images, such as PFNet or our own model, show an advantage under non-optimal conditions, this advantage disappears under optimal training conditions. Despite this observation, our model still makes better predictions for small rectangular objects, e.g., cars.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatially Correlated RIS-Aided Secure Massive MIMO Under CSI and Hardware Imperfections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05239v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the integration of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into a secure multiuser massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in the presence of transceiver hardware impairments (HWI), imperfect channel state information (CSI), and spatially correlated channels. We first introduce a linear minimum-mean-square error estimation algorithm for the aggregate channel by considering the impact of transceiver HWI and RIS phase-shift errors. Then, we derive a lower bound for the achievable ergodic secrecy rate in the presence of a multi-antenna eavesdropper when artificial noise (AN) is employed at the base station (BS). In addition, the obtained expressions of the ergodic secrecy rate are further simplified in some noteworthy special cases to obtain valuable insights. To counteract the effects of HWI, we present a power allocation optimization strategy between the confidential signals and AN, which admits a fixed-point equation solution. Our analysis reveals that a non-zero ergodic secrecy rate is preserved if the total transmit power decreases no faster than $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of RIS elements. Moreover, the ergodic secrecy rate grows logarithmically with the number of BS antennas $M$ and approaches a certain limit in the asymptotic regime $N\rightarrow\infty$. Simulation results are provided to verify the derived analytical results. They reveal the impact of key design parameters on the secrecy rate. It is shown that, with the proposed power allocation strategy, the secrecy rate loss due to HWI can be counteracted by increasing the number of low-cost RIS elements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Empirical Upscaling of Point-scale Soil Moisture Measurements for Spatial Evaluation of Model Simulations and Satellite Retrievals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05229v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evaluation of modelled or satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) estimates is usually dependent on comparisons against in-situ SM measurements. However, the inherent mismatch in spatial support (i.e., scale) necessitates a cautious interpretation of point-to-pixel comparisons. The upscaling of the in-situ measurements to a commensurate resolution to that of the modelled or retrieved SM will lead to a fairer comparison and statistically more defensible evaluation. In this study, we presented an upscaling approach that combines spatiotemporal fusion with machine learning to extrapolate point-scale SM measurements from 28 in-situ sites to a 100 m resolution for an agricultural area of 100 km by 100 km. We conducted a four-fold cross-validation, which consistently demonstrated comparable correlation performance across folds, ranging from 0.6 to 0.9. The proposed approach was further validated based on a cross-cluster strategy by using two spatial subsets within the study area, denoted as cluster A and B, each of which equally comprised of 12 in-situ sites. The cross-cluster validation underscored the capability of the upscaling approach to map the spatial variability of SM within areas that were not covered by in-situ sites, with correlation performance ranging between 0.6 and 0.8. In general, our proposed upscaling approach offers an avenue to extrapolate point measurements of SM to a spatial scale more akin to climatic model grids or remotely sensed observations. Future investigations should delve into a further evaluation of the upscaling approach using independent data, such as model simulations, satellite retrievals or field campaign data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and selected as the Student Paper Competition finalists at the 2024 IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Cognition from Egocentric Video: Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05072v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As humans move around, performing their daily tasks, they are able to recall where they have positioned objects in their environment, even if these objects are currently out of sight. In this paper, we aim to mimic this spatial cognition ability. We thus formulate the task of Out of Sight, Not Out of Mind - 3D tracking active objects using observations captured through an egocentric camera. We introduce Lift, Match and Keep (LMK), a method which lifts partial 2D observations to 3D world coordinates, matches them over time using visual appearance, 3D location and interactions to form object tracks, and keeps these object tracks even when they go out-of-view of the camera - hence keeping in mind what is out of sight. We test LMK on 100 long videos from EPIC-KITCHENS. Our results demonstrate that spatial cognition is critical for correctly locating objects over short and long time scales. E.g., for one long egocentric video, we estimate the 3D location of 50 active objects. Of these, 60% can be correctly positioned in 3D after 2 minutes of leaving the camera view.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages including references and appendix.

| **[The Spatial Structures in the Austrian COVID-19 Protest Movement: A Virtual and Geospatial Twitter User Network Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04942v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, followed by policy measures to combat the virus, evoked public protest movements world-wide. These movements emerged through virtual social networks as well as local protest gatherings. Prior research has studied such movements solely in the virtual space through social network analysis, thereby disregarding the role of local interaction for protest. This study, however, recognizes the importance of the geo-spatial dimension in protest movements. We therefore introduce a large-scale spatial-social network analysis of a georeferenced Twitter user network to understand the regional connections and transnational influences of the Austrian COVID-19 protest movement through the social network. Our findings reveal that the virtual network is distinctly structured along geographic and linguistic boundaries. We further find that the movement is clearly organized along national protest communities. These results highlight the importance of regional and local influencing factors over the impact of transnational influences for the protest movement.</p></details> |  |
| **[StepNet: Spatial-temporal Part-aware Network for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12857v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of sign language recognition (SLR) is to help those who are hard of hearing or deaf overcome the communication barrier. Most existing approaches can be typically divided into two lines, i.e., Skeleton-based and RGB-based methods, but both the two lines of methods have their limitations. Skeleton-based methods do not consider facial expressions, while RGB-based approaches usually ignore the fine-grained hand structure. To overcome both limitations, we propose a new framework called Spatial-temporal Part-aware network~(StepNet), based on RGB parts. As its name suggests, it is made up of two modules: Part-level Spatial Modeling and Part-level Temporal Modeling. Part-level Spatial Modeling, in particular, automatically captures the appearance-based properties, such as hands and faces, in the feature space without the use of any keypoint-level annotations. On the other hand, Part-level Temporal Modeling implicitly mines the long-short term context to capture the relevant attributes over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our StepNet, thanks to spatial-temporal modules, achieves competitive Top-1 Per-instance accuracy on three commonly-used SLR benchmarks, i.e., 56.89% on WLASL, 77.2% on NMFs-CSL, and 77.1% on BOBSL. Additionally, the proposed method is compatible with the optical flow input and can produce superior performance if fused. For those who are hard of hearing, we hope that our work can act as a preliminary step.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding the Potential of FPGA-Based Spatial Acceleration for Large Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15159v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) boasting billions of parameters have generated a significant demand for efficient deployment in inference workloads. The majority of existing approaches rely on temporal architectures that reuse hardware units for different network layers and operators. However, these methods often encounter challenges in achieving low latency due to considerable memory access overhead. This paper investigates the feasibility and potential of model-specific spatial acceleration for LLM inference on FPGAs. Our approach involves the specialization of distinct hardware units for specific operators or layers, facilitating direct communication between them through a dataflow architecture while minimizing off-chip memory accesses. We introduce a comprehensive analytical model for estimating the performance of a spatial LLM accelerator, taking into account the on-chip compute and memory resources available on an FPGA. Through our analysis, we can determine the scenarios in which FPGA-based spatial acceleration can outperform its GPU-based counterpart. To enable more productive implementations of an LLM model on FPGAs, we further provide a library of high-level synthesis (HLS) kernels that are composable and reusable. This library will be made available as open-source. To validate the effectiveness of both our analytical model and HLS library, we have implemented BERT and GPT2 on an AMD Alveo U280 FPGA device. Experimental results demonstrate our approach can achieve up to 13.4x speedup when compared to previous FPGA-based accelerators for the BERT model. For GPT generative inference, we attain a 2.2x speedup compared to DFX, an FPGA overlay, in the prefill stage, while achieving a 1.9x speedup and a 5.7x improvement in energy efficiency compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU in the decode stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the FCCM'24 Journal Track and will appear in ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS)</p></details> |
| **[Spatial Assisted Human-Drone Collaborative Navigation and Interaction through Immersive Mixed Reality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04070v2)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial robots have the potential to play a crucial role in assisting humans with complex and dangerous tasks. Nevertheless, the future industry demands innovative solutions to streamline the interaction process between humans and drones to enable seamless collaboration and efficient co-working. In this paper, we present a novel tele-immersive framework that promotes cognitive and physical collaboration between humans and robots through Mixed Reality (MR). This framework incorporates a novel bi-directional spatial awareness and a multi-modal virtual-physical interaction approaches. The former seamlessly integrates the physical and virtual worlds, offering bidirectional egocentric and exocentric environmental representations. The latter, leveraging the proposed spatial representation, further enhances the collaboration combining a robot planning algorithm for obstacle avoidance with a variable admittance control. This allows users to issue commands based on virtual forces while maintaining compatibility with the environment map. We validate the proposed approach by performing several collaborative planning and exploration tasks involving a drone and an user equipped with a MR headset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently Accepted at International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2024, Nominated as Finalist for IEEE ICRA 2024 Best Paper Award on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles</p></details> |
| **[Spatial estimation of virus infection propensity in hosts determined from GPS-based space-time locations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04455v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Identifying areas in a landscape where individuals have a higher probability of becoming infected with a pathogen is a crucial step towards disease management. Our study data consists of GPS-based tracks of individual white-tailed deer (\textit{Odocoileus virginianus}) and three exotic Cervid species moving freely in a 172-ha high-fenced game preserve over given time periods. A serological test was performed on each individual to measure the antibody concentration of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) for each of three serotypes (EHDV-1, -2, and -6) at the beginning and at the end of each tracking period. EHDV is a vector-borne viral disease indirectly transmitted between ruminant hosts by biting midges (\textit{Culicoides} spp.). The purpose of this study is to estimate the spatial distribution of infection propensity by performing an epidemiological tomography of a region using tracers. We model the data as a binomial linear inverse problem, where spatial coherence is enforced with a total variation regularization. The smoothness of the reconstructed propensity map is selected by the quantile universal threshold, which can also test the null hypothesis that the propensity map is spatially constant. We apply our method to simulated and real data, showing good statistical properties during simulations and consistent results and interpretations compared to intensive field estimations.</p></details> |  |
| **[LightOctree: Lightweight 3D Spatially-Coherent Indoor Lighting Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03925v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a lightweight solution for estimating spatially-coherent indoor lighting from a single RGB image. Previous methods for estimating illumination using volumetric representations have overlooked the sparse distribution of light sources in space, necessitating substantial memory and computational resources for achieving high-quality results. We introduce a unified, voxel octree-based illumination estimation framework to produce 3D spatially-coherent lighting. Additionally, a differentiable voxel octree cone tracing rendering layer is proposed to eliminate regular volumetric representation throughout the entire process and ensure the retention of features across different frequency domains. This reduction significantly decreases spatial usage and required floating-point operations without substantially compromising precision. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality coherent estimation with minimal cost compared to previous methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial Bayesian Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09491v2)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>interpretable, and well understood models that are routinely employed even though, as is revealed through prior and posterior predictive checks, these can poorly characterise the spatial heterogeneity in the underlying process of interest. Here, we propose a new, flexible class of spatial-process models, which we refer to as spatial Bayesian neural networks (SBNNs). An SBNN leverages the representational capacity of a Bayesian neural network; it is tailored to a spatial setting by incorporating a spatial ``embedding layer'' into the network and, possibly, spatially-varying network parameters. An SBNN is calibrated by matching its finite-dimensional distribution at locations on a fine gridding of space to that of a target process of interest. That process could be easy to simulate from or we may have many realisations from it. We propose several variants of SBNNs, most of which are able to match the finite-dimensional distribution of the target process at the selected grid better than conventional BNNs of similar complexity. We also show that an SBNN can be used to represent a variety of spatial processes often used in practice, such as Gaussian processes, lognormal processes, and max-stable processes. We briefly discuss the tools that could be used to make inference with SBNNs, and we conclude with a discussion of their advantages and limitations.</p></details> | 35 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Know Your Neighbors: Improving Single-View Reconstruction via Spatial Vision-Language Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03658v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering the 3D scene geometry from a single view is a fundamental yet ill-posed problem in computer vision. While classical depth estimation methods infer only a 2.5D scene representation limited to the image plane, recent approaches based on radiance fields reconstruct a full 3D representation. However, these methods still struggle with occluded regions since inferring geometry without visual observation requires (i) semantic knowledge of the surroundings, and (ii) reasoning about spatial context. We propose KYN, a novel method for single-view scene reconstruction that reasons about semantic and spatial context to predict each point's density. We introduce a vision-language modulation module to enrich point features with fine-grained semantic information. We aggregate point representations across the scene through a language-guided spatial attention mechanism to yield per-point density predictions aware of the 3D semantic context. We show that KYN improves 3D shape recovery compared to predicting density for each 3D point in isolation. We achieve state-of-the-art results in scene and object reconstruction on KITTI-360, and show improved zero-shot generalization compared to prior work.

| **[Visualization-of-Thought Elicits Spatial Reasoning in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03622v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive performance in language comprehension and various reasoning tasks. However, their abilities in spatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively unexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of unseen objects and actions through a process known as \textbf{the Mind's Eye}, enabling the imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we propose Visualization-of-Thought (\textbf{VoT}) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial reasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding subsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning tasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual tiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT significantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT outperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks. While VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate \textit{mental images} to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process, suggesting its potential viability in MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

In addition, context-dependent adaptive topology as a neighborhood vertex information and attention mechanism leverages a model to better represent actions. In this paper, we propose self-attention GCN hybrid model, Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal self-attention (MSST)-GCN to effectively improve modeling ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on several datasets. We utilize spatial self-attention module with adaptive topology to understand intra-frame interactions within a frame among different body parts, and temporal self-attention module to examine correlations between frames of a node. These two are followed by multi-scale convolution network with dilations, which not only captures the long-range temporal dependencies of joints but also the long-range spatial dependencies (i.e., long-distance dependencies) of node temporal behaviors. They are combined into high-level spatial-temporal representations and output the predicted action with the softmax classifier.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Spatial Summation of Localized Pressure for Haptic Sensory Prostheses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02565v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A host of medical conditions, including amputations, diabetes, stroke, and genetic disease, result in loss of touch sensation. Because most types of sensory loss have no pharmacological treatment or rehabilitative therapy, we propose a haptic sensory prosthesis that provides substitutive feedback. The wrist and forearm are compelling locations for feedback due to available skin area and not occluding the hands, but have reduced mechanoreceptor density compared to the fingertips. Focusing on localized pressure as the feedback modality, we hypothesize that we can improve on prior devices by invoking a wider range of stimulus intensity using multiple points of pressure to evoke spatial summation, which is the cumulative perceptual experience from multiple points of stimuli. We conducted a preliminary perceptual test to investigate this idea and found that just noticeable difference is reduced with two points of pressure compared to one, motivating future work using spatial summation in sensory prostheses.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 2 figures, 2024 IEEE Haptics Symposium Work-in-Progress Paper</p></details> |
| **[VidEdit: Zero-Shot and Spatially Aware Text-Driven Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08707v4)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success for image generation and edition. However, existing diffusion-based video editing approaches lack the ability to offer precise control over generated content that maintains temporal consistency in long-term videos. On the other hand, atlas-based methods provide strong temporal consistency but are costly to edit a video and lack spatial control. In this work, we introduce VidEdit, a novel method for zero-shot text-based video editing that guarantees robust temporal and spatial consistency. In particular, we combine an atlas-based video representation with a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model to provide a training-free and efficient video editing method, which by design fulfills temporal smoothness. To grant precise user control over generated content, we utilize conditional information extracted from off-the-shelf panoptic segmenters and edge detectors which guides the diffusion sampling process. This method ensures a fine spatial control on targeted regions while strictly preserving the structure of the original video. Our quantitative and qualitative experiments show that VidEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods on DAVIS dataset, regarding semantic faithfulness, image preservation, and temporal consistency metrics. With this framework, processing a single video only takes approximately one minute, and it can generate multiple compatible edits based on a unique text prompt.

| **[A Closer Look at Spatial-Slice Features Learning for COVID-19 Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01643v1)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional Computed Tomography (CT) imaging recognition faces two significant challenges: (1) There is often considerable variability in the resolution and size of each CT scan, necessitating strict requirements for the input size and adaptability of models. (2) CT-scan contains large number of out-of-distribution (OOD) slices. The crucial features may only be present in specific spatial regions and slices of the entire CT scan. How can we effectively figure out where these are located? To deal with this, we introduce an enhanced Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) framework specifically designed for CT scan. It aim to filter out a OOD data within whole CT scan, enabling our to select crucial spatial-slice for analysis by reducing 70% redundancy totally. Meanwhile, we proposed Kernel-Density-based slice Sampling (KDS) method to improve the stability when training and inference stage, therefore speeding up the rate of convergence and boosting performance. As a result, the experiments demonstrate the promising performance of our model using a simple EfficientNet-2D (E2D) model, even with only 1% of the training data. The efficacy of our approach has been validated on the COVID-19-CT-DB datasets provided by the DEF-AI-MIA workshop, in conjunction with CVPR 2024.

| **[Dynamics and Optimization in Spatially Distributed Electrical Vehicle Charging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01259v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a spatially distributed demand for electrical vehicle recharging, that must be covered by a fixed set of charging stations. Arriving EVs receive feedback on transport times to each station, and waiting times at congested ones, based on which they make a selfish selection. This selection determines total arrival rates in station queues, which are represented by a fluid state; departure rates are modeled under the assumption that clients have a given sojourn time in the system. The resulting differential equation system is analyzed with tools of optimization. We characterize the equilibrium as the solution to a specific convex program, which has connections to optimal transport problems, and also with road traffic theory. In particular a price of anarchy appears with respect to a social planner's allocation. From a dynamical perspective, global convergence to equilibrium is established, with tools of Lagrange duality and Lyapunov theory. An extension of the model that makes customer demand elastic to observed delays is also presented, and analyzed with extensions of the optimization machinery. Simulations to illustrate the global behavior are presented, which also help validate the model beyond the fluid approximation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Getting it Right: Improving Spatial Consistency in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01197v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key shortcomings in current text-to-image (T2I) models is their inability to consistently generate images which faithfully follow the spatial relationships specified in the text prompt. In this paper, we offer a comprehensive investigation of this limitation, while also developing datasets and methods that achieve state-of-the-art performance. First, we find that current vision-language datasets do not represent spatial relationships well enough; to alleviate this bottleneck, we create SPRIGHT, the first spatially-focused, large scale dataset, by re-captioning 6 million images from 4 widely used vision datasets. Through a 3-fold evaluation and analysis pipeline, we find that SPRIGHT largely improves upon existing datasets in capturing spatial relationships. To demonstrate its efficacy, we leverage only ~0.25% of SPRIGHT and achieve a 22% improvement in generating spatially accurate images while also improving the FID and CMMD scores. Secondly, we find that training on images containing a large number of objects results in substantial improvements in spatial consistency. Notably, we attain state-of-the-art on T2I-CompBench with a spatial score of 0.2133, by fine-tuning on <500 images. Finally, through a set of controlled experiments and ablations, we document multiple findings that we believe will enhance the understanding of factors that affect spatial consistency in text-to-image models. We publicly release our dataset and model to foster further research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project webpage : https://spright-t2i.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Enhanced Precision in Rainfall Forecasting for Mumbai: Utilizing Physics Informed ConvLSTM2D Models for Finer Spatial and Temporal Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01122v1)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting rainfall in tropical areas is challenging due to complex atmospheric behaviour, elevated humidity levels, and the common presence of convective rain events. In the Indian context, the difficulty is further exacerbated because of the monsoon intra seasonal oscillations, which introduce significant variability in rainfall patterns over short periods. Earlier investigations into rainfall prediction leveraged numerical weather prediction methods, along with statistical and deep learning approaches. This study introduces deep learning spatial model aimed at enhancing rainfall prediction accuracy on a finer scale. In this study, we hypothesize that integrating physical understanding improves the precipitation prediction skill of deep learning models with high precision for finer spatial scales, such as cities. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a physics informed ConvLSTM2D model to predict precipitation 6hr and 12hr ahead for Mumbai, India. We utilize ERA5 reanalysis data select predictor variables, across various geopotential levels. The ConvLSTM2D model was trained on the target variable precipitation for 4 different grids representing different spatial grid locations of Mumbai. Thus, the use of the ConvLSTM2D model for rainfall prediction, utilizing physics informed data from specific grids with limited spatial information, reflects current advancements in meteorological research that emphasize both efficiency and localized precision.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Computer and Geosciences. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2310.09311</p></details> |

Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) can effectively capture such spatial feature representations and have demonstrated promising results in performing hyperspectral imagery (HSI) classification tasks of complex land. However, the existing GCN-based HSI classification methods are prone to interference from redundant information when extracting complex features. To classify complex scenes more effectively, this study proposes a novel spatial-spectral reliable contrastive graph convolutional classification framework named S2RC-GCN. Specifically, we fused the spectral and spatial features extracted by the 1D- and 2D-encoder, and the 2D-encoder includes an attention model to automatically extract important information. We then leveraged the fused high-level features to construct graphs and fed the resulting graphs into the GCNs to determine more effective graph representations. Furthermore, a novel reliable contrastive graph convolution was proposed for reliable contrastive learning to learn and fuse robust features. Finally, to test the performance of the model on complex object classification, we used imagery taken by Gaofen-5 in the Jiang Xia area to construct complex land cover datasets. The test results show that compared with other models, our model achieved the best results and effectively improved the classification performance of complex remote sensing imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IJCNN 2024 (International Joint Conference on Neural Networks)</p></details> |

Notably, in scenarios with a large number of reflecting units, the composite channel can be approximated by a Gaussian distribution using the central limit theorem. The receiver utilizes a maximum likelihood detector to recover information in both spatial and symbol domains. In the proposed RIS-SM system, we analytically derive a closed-form expression for the union tight upper bound of ABEP, employing the Gaussian-Chebyshev quadrature method.

| **[DMSSN: Distilled Mixed Spectral-Spatial Network for Hyperspectral Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00694v1)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral salient object detection (HSOD) has exhibited remarkable promise across various applications, particularly in intricate scenarios where conventional RGB-based approaches fall short. Despite the considerable progress in HSOD method advancements, two critical challenges require immediate attention. Firstly, existing hyperspectral data dimension reduction techniques incur a loss of spectral information, which adversely affects detection accuracy. Secondly, previous methods insufficiently harness the inherent distinctive attributes of hyperspectral images (HSIs) during the feature extraction process. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach termed the Distilled Mixed Spectral-Spatial Network (DMSSN), comprising a Distilled Spectral Encoding process and a Mixed Spectral-Spatial Transformer (MSST) feature extraction network. The encoding process utilizes knowledge distillation to construct a lightweight autoencoder for dimension reduction, striking a balance between robust encoding capabilities and low computational costs. The MSST extracts spectral-spatial features through multiple attention head groups, collaboratively enhancing its resistance to intricate scenarios. Moreover, we have created a large-scale HSOD dataset, HSOD-BIT, to tackle the issue of data scarcity in this field and meet the fundamental data requirements of deep network training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DMSSN achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. We will soon make the code and dataset publicly available on https://github.com/anonymous0519/HSOD-BIT.</p></details> |  |
| **[STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12418v2)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Graph Selective State Space Block (GS3B) to precisely characterize the dynamic evolution of STG networks. STG-Mamba is formulated as an Encoder-Decoder architecture, which takes GS3B as the basic module, for efficient sequential data modeling. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of SSSMs, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for adaptive graph structure upgrading. KFGN smoothly fits in the context of selective state space evolution, and at the same time keeps linear complexity. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatial meshing for general Bayesian multivariate models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10080v2)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying spatial and/or temporal associations in multivariate geolocated data of different types is achievable via spatial random effects in a Bayesian hierarchical model, but severe computational bottlenecks arise when spatial dependence is encoded as a latent Gaussian process (GP) in the increasingly common large scale data settings on which we focus. The scenario worsens in non-Gaussian models because the reduced analytical tractability leads to additional hurdles to computational efficiency. In this article, we introduce Bayesian models of spatially referenced data in which the likelihood or the latent process (or both) are not Gaussian. First, we exploit the advantages of spatial processes built via directed acyclic graphs, in which case the spatial nodes enter the Bayesian hierarchy and lead to posterior sampling via routine Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Second, motivated by the possible inefficiencies of popular gradient-based sampling approaches in the multivariate contexts on which we focus, we introduce the simplified manifold preconditioner adaptation (SiMPA) algorithm which uses second order information about the target but avoids expensive matrix operations. We demostrate the performance and efficiency improvements of our methods relative to alternatives in extensive synthetic and real world remote sensing and community ecology applications with large scale data at up to hundreds of thousands of spatial locations and up to tens of outcomes. Software for the proposed methods is part of R package 'meshed', available on CRAN.</p></details> |  |

Our analysis of a pretrained image diffusion model that integrates gated self-attention into the U-Net reveals that spatial grounding often outweighs textual grounding due to the sequential flow from gated self-attention to cross-attention. We demonstrate that such bias can be significantly mitigated without sacrificing accuracy in either grounding by simply rewiring the network architecture, changing from sequential to parallel for gated self-attention and cross-attention. This surprisingly simple yet effective solution does not require any fine-tuning of the network but significantly reduces the trade-off between the two groundings. Our experiments demonstrate significant improvements from the original GLIGEN to the rewired version in the trade-off between textual grounding and spatial grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://re-ground.github.io/</p></details> |

Recently, the introduction of the vision transformer (ViT) has significantly altered the landscape of deep segmentation models. There has been a growing focus on ViTs, driven by their excellent performance and scalability. However, we argue that the current design of the vision transformer-based UNet (ViT-UNet) segmentation models may not effectively handle the heterogeneous appearance (e.g., varying shapes and sizes) of objects of interest in medical image segmentation tasks. To tackle this challenge, we present a structured approach to introduce spatially dynamic components to the ViT-UNet. This adaptation enables the model to effectively capture features of target objects with diverse appearances. This is achieved by three main components: \textbf{(i)} deformable patch embedding; \textbf{(ii)} spatially dynamic multi-head attention; \textbf{(iii)} deformable positional encoding. These components were integrated into a novel architecture, termed AgileFormer. AgileFormer is a spatially agile ViT-UNet designed for medical image segmentation. Experiments in three segmentation tasks using publicly available datasets demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The code is available at \href{https://github.com/sotiraslab/AgileFormer}{https://github.com/sotiraslab/AgileFormer}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flexible Basis Representations for Modeling Large Non-Gaussian Spatial Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06808v3)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nonstationary and non-Gaussian spatial data are common in various fields, including ecology (e.g., counts of animal species), epidemiology (e.g., disease incidence counts in susceptible regions), and environmental science (e.g., remotely-sensed satellite imagery). Due to modern data collection methods, the size of these datasets have grown considerably. Spatial generalized linear mixed models (SGLMMs) are a flexible class of models used to model nonstationary and non-Gaussian datasets. Despite their utility, SGLMMs can be computationally prohibitive for even moderately large datasets (e.g., 5,000 to 100,000 observed locations). To circumvent this issue, past studies have embedded nested radial basis functions into the SGLMM. However, two crucial specifications (knot placement and bandwidth parameters), which directly affect model performance, are typically fixed prior to model-fitting. We propose a novel approach to model large nonstationary and non-Gaussian spatial datasets using adaptive radial basis functions. Our approach: (1) partitions the spatial domain into subregions; (2) employs reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) to infer the number and location of the knots within each partition; and (3) models the latent spatial surface using partition-varying and adaptive basis functions. Through an extensive simulation study, we show that our approach provides more accurate predictions than competing methods while preserving computational efficiency. We demonstrate our approach on two environmental datasets - incidences of plant species and counts of bird species in the United States.</p></details> |  |

They provide insights into mineral exploration, vulnerability to natural hazards, and many other applications. These maps are created using numerical or conceptual models that use geological observations to extrapolate data. Geostatistical techniques have traditionally been used to generate reliable predictions that take into account the spatial patterns inherent in the data. However, as the number of auxiliary variables increases, these methods become more labor-intensive. Additionally, traditional machine learning methods often struggle with spatially correlated data and extracting valuable non-linear information from geoscientific datasets. To address these limitations, a new architecture called the Spatially Constrained Bayesian Network (SCB-Net) has been developed. The SCB-Net aims to effectively exploit the information from auxiliary variables while producing spatially constrained predictions. It is made up of two parts, the first part focuses on learning underlying patterns in the auxiliary variables while the second part integrates ground-truth data and the learned embeddings from the first part. Moreover, to assess model uncertainty, a technique called Monte Carlo dropout is used as a Bayesian approximation. The SCB-Net has been applied to two selected areas in northern Quebec, Canada, and has demonstrated its potential in generating field-data-constrained lithological maps while allowing assessment of prediction uncertainty for decision-making. This study highlights the promising advancements of deep neural networks in geostatistics, particularly in handling complex spatial feature learning tasks, leading to improved spatial information techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3559 words, 14 figures</p></details> |

Efforts have been made to automate this task, but the variable lighting and hole surface conditions, as well as the requirements for short setup and task execution time make the automation challenging. In this study, we introduce a vision and proprioceptive data-driven robot control model for this task that is robust to challenging lighting and hole surface conditions. This model consists of a spatial attention point network (SAP) and a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) policy that are trained jointly end-to-end to control the robot. The model is trained in an offline manner, with a sample-efficient framework designed to reduce training time and minimize the reality gap when transferring the model to the physical world. Through evaluations with an industrial robot performing the task in 12 unknown holes, starting from 16 different initial positions, and under three different lighting conditions (two with misleading shadows), we demonstrate that SAP can generate relevant attention points of the image even in challenging lighting conditions. We also show that the proposed model enables task execution with higher success rate and shorter task completion time than various baselines. Due to the proposed model's high effectiveness even in severe lighting, initial positions, and hole conditions, and the offline training framework's high sample-efficiency and short training time, this approach can be easily applied to construction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters on 08 February 2023</p></details> |
| **[Nonstationary Spatial Process Models with Spatially Varying Covariance Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11873v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial process models for capturing nonstationary behavior in scientific data present several challenges with regard to statistical inference and uncertainty quantification. While nonstationary spatially-varying kernels are attractive for their flexibility and richness, their practical implementation has been reported to be overwhelmingly cumbersome because of the high-dimensional parameter spaces resulting from the spatially varying process parameters. Matters are considerably exacerbated with the massive numbers of spatial locations over which measurements are available. With limited theoretical tractability offered by nonstationary spatial processes, overcoming such computational bottlenecks require a synergy between model construction and algorithm development. We build a class of scalable nonstationary spatial process models using spatially varying covariance kernels. We present some novel consequences of such representations that befit computationally efficient implementation. More specifically, we operate within a coherent Bayesian modeling framework to achieve full uncertainty quantification using a Hybrid Monte-Carlo with nested interweaving. We carry out experiments on synthetic data sets to explore model selection and parameter identifiability and assess inferential improvements accrued from the nonstationary modeling. We illustrate strengths and pitfalls with a data set on remote sensed normalized difference vegetation index with further analysis of a lead contamination data set in the Supplement.</p></details> |  |

In the transmission phase, a column-wise activation strategy is implemented for the TRIS panel, where the specific column elements are activated per time slot. Concurrently, the receiver employs the maximum likelihood detection technique. Based on this, for the transmit signals, we derive the closed-form expressions for the upper bounds of the average bit error probability (ABEP) of the proposed scheme from different perspectives, employing both vector-based and element-based approaches. Furthermore, we provide the asymptotic closed-form expressions for the ABEP of the TRIS-SM scheme, as well as the diversity gain. To improve the performance of the proposed TRIS-SM system, we optimize ABEP with a fixed data rate. Additionally, we provide lower bounds to simplify the computational complexity of improved TRIS-SM scheme. The Monte Carlo simulation method is used to validate the theoretical derivations exhaustively. The results demonstrate that the proposed TRIS-SM scheme can achieve better ABEP performance compared to the conventional SM scheme. Furthermore, the improved TRIS-SM scheme outperforms the TRIS-SM scheme in terms of reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[RFAConv: Innovating Spatial Attention and Standard Convolutional Operation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03198v6)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial attention has been widely used to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks. However, it has certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a new perspective on the effectiveness of spatial attention, which is that the spatial attention mechanism essentially solves the problem of convolutional kernel parameter sharing. However, the information contained in the attention map generated by spatial attention is not sufficient for large-size convolutional kernels. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism called Receptive-Field Attention (RFA). Existing spatial attention, such as Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Coordinated Attention (CA) focus only on spatial features, which does not fully address the problem of convolutional kernel parameter sharing. In contrast, RFA not only focuses on the receptive-field spatial feature but also provides effective attention weights for large-size convolutional kernels. The Receptive-Field Attention convolutional operation (RFAConv), developed by RFA, represents a new approach to replace the standard convolution operation. It offers nearly negligible increment of computational cost and parameters, while significantly improving network performance. We conducted a series of experiments on ImageNet-1k, COCO, and VOC datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Of particular importance, we believe that it is time to shift focus from spatial features to receptive-field spatial features for current spatial attention mechanisms. In this way, we can further improve network performance and achieve even better results. The code and pre-trained models for the relevant tasks can be found at https://github.com/Liuchen1997/RFAConv.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11figures |

A common approach involves employing an additive regression model to capture the relationship between observations and covariates, accounting for spatial variability not explained by the covariates through a Gaussian random field. While theoretical analyses of such models have predominantly focused on prediction and covariance parameter inference, recent attention has shifted towards understanding the theoretical properties of regression coefficient estimates, particularly in the context of spatial confounding. This article studies the effect of misspecified covariates, in particular when the misspecification changes the smoothness. We analyze the theoretical properties of the generalize least-square estimator under infill asymptotics, and show that the estimator can have counter-intuitive properties. In particular, the estimated regression coefficients can converge to zero as the number of observations increases, despite high correlations between observations and covariates. Perhaps even more surprising, the estimates can diverge to infinity under certain conditions. Through an application to temperature and precipitation data, we show that both behaviors can be observed for real data. Finally, we propose a simple fix to the problem by adding a smoothing step in the regression.</p></details> |  |

The historical spatial context of the agent provides a similarity signal for self-supervised contrastive learning. We present a unique approach, termed Environmental Spatial Similarity (ESS), that complements existing contrastive learning methods. Using images from simulated, photorealistic environments as an experimental setting, we demonstrate that ESS outperforms traditional instance discrimination approaches. Moreover, sampling additional data from the same environment substantially improves accuracy and provides new augmentations. ESS allows remarkable proficiency in room classification and spatial prediction tasks, especially in unfamiliar environments. This learning paradigm has the potential to enable rapid visual learning in agents operating in new environments with unique visual characteristics. Potentially transformative applications span from robotics to space exploration. Our proof of concept demonstrates improved efficiency over methods that rely on extensive, disconnected datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semi-supervised Nighttime Dehazing Baseline with Spatial-Frequency Aware and Realistic Brightness Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18548v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing research based on deep learning has extensively explored the problem of daytime image dehazing. However, few studies have considered the characteristics of nighttime hazy scenes. There are two distinctions between nighttime and daytime haze. First, there may be multiple active colored light sources with lower illumination intensity in nighttime scenes, which may cause haze, glow and noise with localized, coupled and frequency inconsistent characteristics. Second, due to the domain discrepancy between simulated and real-world data, unrealistic brightness may occur when applying a dehazing model trained on simulated data to real-world data. To address the above two issues, we propose a semi-supervised model for real-world nighttime dehazing. First, the spatial attention and frequency spectrum filtering are implemented as a spatial-frequency domain information interaction module to handle the first issue. Second, a pseudo-label-based retraining strategy and a local window-based brightness loss for semi-supervised training process is designed to suppress haze and glow while achieving realistic brightness. Experiments on public benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and its superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

In this work we present a unified framework to predict both point-wise correspondences and shape interpolation between 3D shapes. To this end, we combine the deep functional map framework with classical surface deformation models to map shapes in both spectral and spatial domains. On the one hand, by incorporating spatial maps, our method obtains more accurate and smooth point-wise correspondences compared to previous functional map methods for shape matching. On the other hand, by introducing spectral maps, our method gets rid of commonly used but computationally expensive geodesic distance constraints that are only valid for near-isometric shape deformations. Furthermore, we propose a novel test-time adaptation scheme to capture both pose-dominant and shape-dominant deformations. Using different challenging datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for both shape matching and interpolation, even compared to supervised approaches.</p></details> | accepted by CVPR2024 |

Existing methods often decompose 3D shapes into a sequence of localized components, treating each element in isolation without considering spatial consistency. As a result, these approaches exhibit limited versatility in 3D data representation and shape generation, hindering their ability to generate highly diverse 3D shapes that comply with the specified constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial-aware 3D shape generation framework that leverages 2D plane representations for enhanced 3D shape modeling. To ensure spatial coherence and reduce memory usage, we incorporate a hybrid shape representation technique that directly learns a continuous signed distance field representation of the 3D shape using orthogonal 2D planes. Additionally, we meticulously enforce spatial correspondences across distinct planes using a transformer-based autoencoder structure, promoting the preservation of spatial relationships in the generated 3D shapes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape generation methods on various tasks, including unconditional shape generation, multi-modal shape completion, single-view reconstruction, and text-to-shape synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Spatial change of support is a key inferential problem in these applications and have become standard in univariate settings; however, it is less standard in multivariate settings. There are several existing multivariate spatial models that can be easily combined with multiscale spatial approach to analyze multivariate multiscale spatial data. In this paper, we propose three new models from such combinations for bivariate multiscale spatial data in a Bayesian context. In particular, we extend spatial random effects models, multivariate conditional autoregressive models, and ordered hierarchical models through a multiscale spatial approach. We run simulation studies for the three models and compare them in terms of prediction performance and computational efficiency. We motivate our models through an analysis of 2015 Texas annual average percentage receiving two blood tests from the Dartmouth Atlas Project.</p></details> |  |

In practice, one must select a truncation level for use. We compare five criteria for the selection of an appropriate truncation level, including AIC and BIC based on a log composite likelihood, a fraction of variance explained criterion, a fitted mean squared error, and a prediction error with one standard error rule. Based on the use of extensive simulation studies, we propose that BIC constitutes a reasonable default criterion for the selection of the truncation level for use in a spatial functional generalized linear model. In addition, we demonstrate that the spatial model with a functional covariate outperforms other models when the data contain spatial structure and response variables are in fact influenced by a functional covariate process. We apply the spatial functional generalized linear model to a problem in which the objective is to relate COVID-19 vaccination rates in counties of states in the Midwestern United States to the number of new cases from previous weeks in those same geographic regions.</p></details> |  |

We refer to generating such simultaneous movements as performing 'spatial compositions'. In contrast to temporal compositions that seek to transition from one action to another, spatial compositing requires understanding which body parts are involved in which action, to be able to move them simultaneously. Motivated by the observation that the correspondence between actions and body parts is encoded in powerful language models, we extract this knowledge by prompting GPT-3 with text such as "what are the body parts involved in the action <action name>?", while also providing the parts list and few-shot examples. Given this action-part mapping, we combine body parts from two motions together and establish the first automated method to spatially compose two actions. However, training data with compositional actions is always limited by the combinatorics. Hence, we further create synthetic data with this approach, and use it to train a new state-of-the-art text-to-motion generation model, called SINC ("SImultaneous actioN Compositions for 3D human motions"). In our experiments, that training with such GPT-guided synthetic data improves spatial composition generation over baselines.

However, existing RefSR methods are limited by the faithfulness of content reconstruction and the effectiveness of texture transfer in large scaling factors. Conditional diffusion models have opened up new opportunities for generating realistic high-resolution images, but effectively utilizing reference images within these models remains an area for further exploration. Furthermore, content fidelity is difficult to guarantee in areas without relevant reference information. To solve these issues, we propose a change-aware diffusion model named Ref-Diff for RefSR, using the land cover change priors to guide the denoising process explicitly. Specifically, we inject the priors into the denoising model to improve the utilization of reference information in unchanged areas and regulate the reconstruction of semantically relevant content in changed areas. With this powerful guidance, we decouple the semantics-guided denoising and reference texture-guided denoising processes to improve the model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method compared with state-of-the-art RefSR methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Most common indoor localization methods for human tracking technologies require expensive infrastructures, deployment and maintenance. To overcome this problem, environmental sounds have been used for infrastructure-free localization. While they achieve room-level classification, they suffer from two problems: low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) condition and non-uniqueness of sound over the coverage area. A microphone localization method was proposed using supervised spectral decomposition and spatial likelihood to solve these problems. The proposed method was evaluated with actual recordings in an experimental room with a size of 12 x 30 m. The results showed that the proposed method with supervised NMF was robust under low-SNR condition compared to a simple feature (mel frequency cepstrum coefficient: MFCC). Additionally, the proposed method could be easily integrated with prior distribution, which is available from other Bayesian localizations.

| **[Diagrammatic Instructions to Specify Spatial Objectives and Constraints with Applications to Mobile Base Placement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12465v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Spatial Diagrammatic Instructions (SDIs), an approach for human operators to specify objectives and constraints that are related to spatial regions in the working environment. Human operators are enabled to sketch out regions directly on camera images that correspond to the objectives and constraints. These sketches are projected to 3D spatial coordinates, and continuous Spatial Instruction Maps (SIMs) are learned upon them. These maps can then be integrated into optimization problems for tasks of robots. In particular, we demonstrate how Spatial Diagrammatic Instructions can be applied to solve the Base Placement Problem of mobile manipulators, which concerns the best place to put the manipulator to facilitate a certain task. Human operators can specify, via sketch, spatial regions of interest for a manipulation task and permissible regions for the mobile manipulator to be at. Then, an optimization problem that maximizes the manipulator's reachability, or coverage, over the designated regions of interest while remaining in the permissible regions is solved. We provide extensive empirical evaluations, and show that our formulation of Spatial Instruction Maps provides accurate representations of user-specified diagrammatic instructions. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our diagrammatic approach to the Mobile Base Placement Problem enables higher quality solutions and faster run-time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engagement Measurement Based on Facial Landmarks and Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17175v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engagement in virtual learning is crucial for a variety of factors including learner satisfaction, performance, and compliance with learning programs, but measuring it is a challenging task. There is therefore considerable interest in utilizing artificial intelligence and affective computing to measure engagement in natural settings as well as on a large scale. This paper introduces a novel, privacy-preserving method for engagement measurement from videos. It uses facial landmarks, which carry no personally identifiable information, extracted from videos via the MediaPipe deep learning solution. The extracted facial landmarks are fed to a Spatial-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (ST-GCN) to output the engagement level of the learner in the video. To integrate the ordinal nature of the engagement variable into the training process, ST-GCNs undergo training in a novel ordinal learning framework based on transfer learning. Experimental results on two video student engagement measurement datasets show the superiority of the proposed method compared to previous methods with improved state-of-the-art on the EngageNet dataset with a %3.1 improvement in four-class engagement level classification accuracy and on the Online Student Engagement dataset with a %1.5 improvement in binary engagement classification accuracy. The relatively lightweight ST-GCN and its integration with the real-time MediaPipe deep learning solution make the proposed approach capable of being deployed on virtual learning platforms and measuring engagement in real time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Spatial Adaptation and Temporal Coherence in Diffusion Models for Video Super-Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17000v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are just at a tipping point for image super-resolution task. Nevertheless, it is not trivial to capitalize on diffusion models for video super-resolution which necessitates not only the preservation of visual appearance from low-resolution to high-resolution videos, but also the temporal consistency across video frames. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, pursuing Spatial Adaptation and Temporal Coherence (SATeCo), for video super-resolution. SATeCo pivots on learning spatial-temporal guidance from low-resolution videos to calibrate both latent-space high-resolution video denoising and pixel-space video reconstruction. Technically, SATeCo freezes all the parameters of the pre-trained UNet and VAE, and only optimizes two deliberately-designed spatial feature adaptation (SFA) and temporal feature alignment (TFA) modules, in the decoder of UNet and VAE. SFA modulates frame features via adaptively estimating affine parameters for each pixel, guaranteeing pixel-wise guidance for high-resolution frame synthesis. TFA delves into feature interaction within a 3D local window (tubelet) through self-attention, and executes cross-attention between tubelet and its low-resolution counterpart to guide temporal feature alignment. Extensive experiments conducted on the REDS4 and Vid4 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |
| **[Point-DETR3D: Leveraging Imagery Data with Spatial Point Prior for Weakly Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15317v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training high-accuracy 3D detectors necessitates massive labeled 3D annotations with 7 degree-of-freedom, which is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, the form of point annotations is proposed to offer significant prospects for practical applications in 3D detection, which is not only more accessible and less expensive but also provides strong spatial information for object localization. In this paper, we empirically discover that it is non-trivial to merely adapt Point-DETR to its 3D form, encountering two main bottlenecks: 1) it fails to encode strong 3D prior into the model, and 2) it generates low-quality pseudo labels in distant regions due to the extreme sparsity of LiDAR points. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Point-DETR3D, a teacher-student framework for weakly semi-supervised 3D detection, designed to fully capitalize on point-wise supervision within a constrained instance-wise annotation budget.Different from Point-DETR which encodes 3D positional information solely through a point encoder, we propose an explicit positional query initialization strategy to enhance the positional prior. Considering the low quality of pseudo labels at distant regions produced by the teacher model, we enhance the detector's perception by incorporating dense imagery data through a novel Cross-Modal Deformable RoI Fusion (D-RoI).Moreover, an innovative point-guided self-supervised learning technique is proposed to allow for fully exploiting point priors, even in student models.Extensive experiments on representative nuScenes dataset demonstrate our Point-DETR3D obtains significant improvements compared to previous works. Notably, with only 5% of labeled data, Point-DETR3D achieves over 90% performance of its fully supervised counterpart.</p></details> | Accepted by AAAI2024 |
| **[Privacy-Protected Spatial Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16773v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial autoregressive (SAR) models are important tools for studying network effects. However, with an increasing emphasis on data privacy, data providers often implement privacy protection measures that make classical SAR models inapplicable. In this study, we introduce a privacy-protected SAR model with noise-added response and covariates to meet privacy-protection requirements. However, in this scenario, the traditional quasi-maximum likelihood estimator becomes infeasible because the likelihood function cannot be formulated. To address this issue, we first consider an explicit expression for the likelihood function with only noise-added responses. However, the derivatives are biased owing to the noise in the covariates. Therefore, we develop techniques that can correct the biases introduced by noise. Correspondingly, a Newton-Raphson-type algorithm is proposed to obtain the estimator, leading to a corrected likelihood estimator. To further enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a corrected least squares estimator based on the idea of bias correction. These two estimation methods ensure both data security and the attainment of statistically valid estimators. Theoretical analysis of both estimators is carefully conducted, and statistical inference methods are discussed. The finite sample performances of different methods are demonstrated through extensive simulations and the analysis of a real dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Precise 3D Human Pose Estimation with Multi-Perspective Spatial-Temporal Relational Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16700v2)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D human pose estimation captures the human joint points in three-dimensional space while keeping the depth information and physical structure. That is essential for applications that require precise pose information, such as human-computer interaction, scene understanding, and rehabilitation training. Due to the challenges in data collection, mainstream datasets of 3D human pose estimation are primarily composed of multi-view video data collected in laboratory environments, which contains rich spatial-temporal correlation information besides the image frame content. Given the remarkable self-attention mechanism of transformers, capable of capturing the spatial-temporal correlation from multi-view video datasets, we propose a multi-stage framework for 3D sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) human pose detection. Firstly, the spatial module represents the human pose feature by intra-image content, while the frame-image relation module extracts temporal relationships and 3D spatial positional relationship features between the multi-perspective images. Secondly, the self-attention mechanism is adopted to eliminate the interference from non-human body parts and reduce computing resources. Our method is evaluated on Human3.6M, a popular 3D human pose detection dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on this dataset.

The robots are able to gather noisy measurements from an area of interest during their movements to build a Gaussian Process (GP) model of a spatio-temporal field. The model is then utilized to predict the spatio-temporal phenomenon at different points of interest. To spatially and temporally navigate the group of robots so that they can optimally acquire maximal information gains while their connectivity is preserved, we propose a novel multistep prediction informative path planning optimization strategy employing our newly defined local cost functions. By using the dual decomposition method, it is feasible and practical to effectively solve the optimization problem in a distributed manner. The proposed method was validated through synthetic experiments utilizing real-world data sets.</p></details> |  |

The proposed method is based on learning a 3D spatio-spatial temporal convolution to create detailed pictures of forehead patterns. We introduce a new CNN model called the Forehead Spatio-Spatial Temporal Network (FH-SSTNet), which utilizes a 3D CNN architecture with triplet loss to capture distinguishing features. We enhance the model's discrimination capability using Arcloss in the network's head. Experimentation on the Forehead Creases version 1 (FH-V1) dataset, containing 247 unique subjects, demonstrates the superior performance of FH-SSTNet compared to existing methods and pre-trained CNNs like ResNet50, especially for forehead-based user verification. The results demonstrate the superior performance of FH-SSTNet for forehead-based user verification, confirming its effectiveness in identity authentication.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 Figure, IWBF conference</p></details> |
| **[Four universal growth regimes in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs I](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11840v3)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-dependent first passage percolation is a spreading process on a graph where the transmission time through each edge depends on the direct surroundings of the edge. In particular, the classical iid transmission time $L_{xy}$ is multiplied by $(W_xW_y)^\mu$, a polynomial of the expected degrees $W_x, W_y$ of the endpoints of the edge $xy$, which we call the penalty function. Beyond the Markov case, we also allow any distribution for $L_{xy}$ with regularly varying distribution near $0$. We then run this process on three spatial scale-free random graph models: finite and infinite Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees. We show that as the penalty-function, i.e., $\mu$ increases, the transmission time between two far away vertices sweeps through four universal phases: explosive (with tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but strictly sublinear, and linear in the Euclidean distance. The strictly polynomial growth phase here is a new phenomenon that so far was extremely rare in spatial graph models. The four growth phases are highly robust in the model parameters and are not restricted to phase boundaries. Further, the transition points between the phases depend non-trivially on the main model parameters: the tail of the degree distribution, a long-range parameter governing the presence of long edges, and the behaviour of the distribution $L$ near $0$. In this paper we develop new methods to prove the upper bounds in all sub-explosive phases. Our companion paper complements these results by providing matching lower bounds in the polynomial and linear regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>82 pa...</summary><p>82 pages.

| **[Temporal-Spatial Object Relations Modeling for Vision-and-Language Navigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15691v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task where an agent is required to navigate to a natural language described location via vision observations. The navigation abilities of the agent can be enhanced by the relations between objects, which are usually learned using internal objects or external datasets. The relationships between internal objects are modeled employing graph convolutional network (GCN) in traditional studies. However, GCN tends to be shallow, limiting its modeling ability. To address this issue, we utilize a cross attention mechanism to learn the connections between objects over a trajectory, which takes temporal continuity into account, termed as Temporal Object Relations (TOR). The external datasets have a gap with the navigation environment, leading to inaccurate modeling of relations. To avoid this problem, we construct object connections based on observations from all viewpoints in the navigational environment, which ensures complete spatial coverage and eliminates the gap, called Spatial Object Relations (SOR). Additionally, we observe that agents may repeatedly visit the same location during navigation, significantly hindering their performance. For resolving this matter, we introduce the Turning Back Penalty (TBP) loss function, which penalizes the agent's repetitive visiting behavior, substantially reducing the navigational distance. Experimental results on the REVERIE, SOON, and R2R datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computationally Scalable Bayesian SPDE Modeling for Censored Spatial Responses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15670v1)** | 2024-03-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Observations of groundwater pollutants, such as arsenic or Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), are riddled with left censoring. These measurements have impact on the health and lifestyle of the populace. Left censoring of these spatially correlated observations are usually addressed by applying Gaussian processes (GPs), which have theoretical advantages. However, this comes with a challenging computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$, which is impractical for large datasets. Additionally, a sizable proportion of the data being left-censored creates further bottlenecks, since the likelihood computation now involves an intractable high-dimensional integral of the multivariate Gaussian density. In this article, we tackle these two problems simultaneously by approximating the GP with a Gaussian Markov random field (GMRF) approach that exploits an explicit link between a GP with Mat\'ern correlation function and a GMRF using stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). We introduce a GMRF-based measurement error into the model, which alleviates the likelihood computation for the censored data, drastically improving the speed of the model while maintaining admirable accuracy. Our approach demonstrates robustness and substantial computational scalability, compared to state-of-the-art methods for censored spatial responses across various simulation settings. Finally, the fit of this fully Bayesian model to the concentration of PFOS in groundwater available at 24,959 sites across California, where 46.62\% responses are censored, produces prediction surface and uncertainty quantification in real time, thereby substantiating the applicability and scalability of the proposed method. Code for implementation is made available via GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Initialization for High-Dimensional Phase Retrieval with Biased Spatial Directions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15548v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore a spectral initialization method that plays a central role in contemporary research on signal estimation in nonconvex scenarios. In a noiseless phase retrieval framework, we precisely analyze the method's performance in the high-dimensional limit when sensing vectors follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution for two rotationally invariant models of the covariance matrix C. In the first model C is a projector on a lower dimensional space while in the second it is a Wishart matrix. Our analytical results extend the well-established case when C is the identity matrix. Our examination shows that the introduction of biased spatial directions leads to a substantial improvement in the spectral method's effectiveness, particularly when the number of measurements is less than the signal's dimension. This extension also consistently reveals a phase transition phenomenon dependent on the ratio between sample size and signal dimension. Surprisingly, both of these models share the same threshold value.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

However, the existing benchmark datasets lack diversity, and models trained on these data cannot generalize well to dynamic wild scenarios. To meet the goal of improving the explicit generalization of ReID models, we develop a new Open-World, Diverse, Cross-Spatial-Temporal dataset named OWD with several distinct features. 1) Diverse collection scenes: multiple independent open-world and highly dynamic collecting scenes, including streets, intersections, shopping malls, etc. 2) Diverse lighting variations: long time spans from daytime to nighttime with abundant illumination changes. 3) Diverse person status: multiple camera networks in all seasons with normal/adverse weather conditions and diverse pedestrian appearances (e.g., clothes, personal belongings, poses, etc.). 4) Protected privacy: invisible faces for privacy critical applications. To improve the implicit generalization of ReID, we further propose a Latent Domain Expansion (LDE) method to develop the potential of source data, which decouples discriminative identity-relevant and trustworthy domain-relevant features and implicitly enforces domain-randomized identity feature space expansion with richer domain diversity to facilitate domain invariant representations. Our comprehensive evaluations with most benchmark datasets in the community are crucial for progress, although this work is far from the grand goal toward open-world and dynamic wild applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCV in 2024</p></details> |
| **[Creating a Spatial Vulnerability Index for Environmental Health](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14954v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme natural hazards are increasing in frequency and intensity. These natural changes in our environment, combined with man-made pollution, have substantial economic, social and health impacts globally. The impact of the environment on human health (environmental health) is becoming well understood in international research literature. However, there are significant barriers to understanding key characteristics of this impact, related to substantial data volumes, data access rights and the time required to compile and compare data over regions and time. This study aims to reduce these barriers in Australia by creating an open data repository of national environmental health data and presenting a methodology for the production of health outcome-weighted population vulnerability indices related to extreme heat, extreme cold and air pollution at various temporal and geographical resolutions. Current state-of-the-art methods for the calculation of vulnerability indices include equal weight percentile ranking and the use of principal component analysis (PCA). The weighted vulnerability index methodology proposed in this study offers an advantage over others in the literature by considering health outcomes in the calculation process. The resulting vulnerability percentiles more clearly align population sensitivity and adaptive capacity with health risks. The temporal and spatial resolutions of the indices enable national monitoring on a scale never before seen across Australia. Additionally, we show that a weekly temporal resolution can be used to identify spikes in vulnerability due to changes in relative national environmental exposure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Next POI Prediction: Spatial and Semantic Augmentation with Remote Sensing Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04271v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next point-of-interest (POI) prediction is a significant task in location-based services, yet its complexity arises from the consolidation of spatial and semantic intent. This fusion is subject to the influences of historical preferences, prevailing location, and environmental factors, thereby posing significant challenges. In addition, the uneven POI distribution further complicates the next POI prediction procedure. To address these challenges, we enrich input features and propose an effective deep-learning method within a two-step prediction framework. Our method first incorporates remote sensing data, capturing pivotal environmental context to enhance input features regarding both location and semantics. Subsequently, we employ a region quad-tree structure to integrate urban remote sensing, road network, and POI distribution spaces, aiming to devise a more coherent graph representation method for urban spatial. Leveraging this method, we construct the QR-P graph for the user's historical trajectories to encapsulate historical travel knowledge, thereby augmenting input features with comprehensive spatial and semantic insights. We devise distinct embedding modules to encode these features and employ an attention mechanism to fuse diverse encodings. In the two-step prediction procedure, we initially identify potential spatial zones by predicting user-preferred tiles, followed by pinpointing specific POIs of a designated type within the projected tiles. Empirical findings from four real-world location-based social network datasets underscore the remarkable superiority of our proposed approach over competitive baseline methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 11 figures, Accepted by ICDE 2024</p></details> |

However, achieving high-fidelity 4D generation with spatial-temporal consistency remains a challenge. In this work, we propose STAG4D, a novel framework that combines pre-trained diffusion models with dynamic 3D Gaussian splatting for high-fidelity 4D generation. Drawing inspiration from 3D generation techniques, we utilize a multi-view diffusion model to initialize multi-view images anchoring on the input video frames, where the video can be either real-world captured or generated by a video diffusion model. To ensure the temporal consistency of the multi-view sequence initialization, we introduce a simple yet effective fusion strategy to leverage the first frame as a temporal anchor in the self-attention computation. With the almost consistent multi-view sequences, we then apply the score distillation sampling to optimize the 4D Gaussian point cloud. The 4D Gaussian spatting is specially crafted for the generation task, where an adaptive densification strategy is proposed to mitigate the unstable Gaussian gradient for robust optimization. Notably, the proposed pipeline does not require any pre-training or fine-tuning of diffusion networks, offering a more accessible and practical solution for the 4D generation task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms prior 4D generation works in rendering quality, spatial-temporal consistency, and generation robustness, setting a new state-of-the-art for 4D generation from diverse inputs, including text, image, and video.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the physical layer security of an RIS-assisted multiple-antenna communication system in the presence of random spatially distributed eavesdroppers. The RIS-to-ground channels are assumed to experience Rician fading. Using stochastic geometry, exact distributions of the received signal-to-noise-ratios (SNRs) at the legitimate user and the eavesdroppers located according to a Poisson point process (PPP) are derived, and closed-form expressions for the secrecy outage probability (SOP) and the ergodic secrecy capacity (ESC) are obtained to provide insightful guidelines for system design. First, the secrecy diversity order is obtained as $\frac{2}{\alpha_2}$, where $\alpha_2$ denotes the path loss exponent of the RIS-to-ground links. Then, it is revealed that the secrecy performance is mainly affected by the number of RIS reflecting elements, $N$, and the impact of the number of transmit antennas and transmit power at the base station is marginal. In addition, when the locations of the randomly located eavesdroppers are unknown, deploying the RIS closer to the legitimate user rather than to the base station is shown to be more efficient. Moreover, it is also found that the density of randomly located eavesdroppers, $\lambda_e$, has an additive effect on the asymptotic ESC performance given by $\log_2{\left({1}/{\lambda_e}\right)}$. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of these theoretical observations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications</p></details> |
| **[Dodging DeepFake Detection via Implicit Spatial-Domain Notch Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2009.09213v6)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current high-fidelity generation and high-precision detection of DeepFake images are at an arms race. We believe that producing DeepFakes that are highly realistic and 'detection evasive' can serve the ultimate goal of improving future generation DeepFake detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images without hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch filtering. We first demonstrate that frequency-domain notch filtering, although famously shown to be effective in removing periodic noise in the spatial domain, is infeasible for our task at hand due to the manual designs required for the notch filters. We, therefore, resort to a learning-based approach to reproduce the notch filtering effects, but solely in the spatial domain. We adopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking the periodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-free fake images, and we name our method DeepNotch. Deep image filtering provides a specialized filter for each pixel in the noisy image, producing filtered images with high fidelity compared to their DeepFake counterparts. Moreover, we also use the semantic information of the image to generate an adversarial guidance map to add noise intelligently. Our large-scale evaluation on 3 representative state-of-the-art DeepFake detection methods (tested on 16 types of DeepFakes) has demonstrated that our technique significantly reduces the accuracy of these 3 fake image detection methods, 36.79% on average and up to 97.02% in the best case.</p></details> | 14 pages |

While most existing methods rely on fully-supervised learning, the manual labeling of point cloud data is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, several annotation-efficient methods have been proposed to address this challenge. Although effective, these methods rely on weak annotations or additional multi-modal data like images, and the potential benefits inherent in the point cloud sequence are still underexplored. To this end, we explore the feasibility of self-supervised motion prediction with only unlabeled LiDAR point clouds. Initially, we employ an optimal transport solver to establish coarse correspondences between current and future point clouds as the coarse pseudo motion labels. Training models directly using such coarse labels leads to noticeable spatial and temporal prediction inconsistencies. To mitigate these issues, we introduce three simple spatial and temporal regularization losses, which facilitate the self-supervised training process effectively. Experimental results demonstrate the significant superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |
| **[PGCN: Progressive Graph Convolutional Networks for Spatial-Temporal Traffic Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2202.08982v3)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complex spatial-temporal correlations in transportation networks make the traffic forecasting problem challenging. Since transportation system inherently possesses graph structures, many research efforts have been put with graph neural networks. Recently, constructing adaptive graphs to the data has shown promising results over the models relying on a single static graph structure. However, the graph adaptations are applied during the training phases and do not reflect the data used during the testing phases. Such shortcomings can be problematic especially in traffic forecasting since the traffic data often suffer from unexpected changes and irregularities in the time series. In this study, we propose a novel traffic forecasting framework called Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (PGCN). PGCN constructs a set of graphs by progressively adapting to online input data during the training and testing phases. Specifically, we implemented the model to construct progressive adjacency matrices by learning trend similarities among graph nodes. Then, the model is combined with the dilated causal convolution and gated activation unit to extract temporal features. With residual and skip connections, PGCN performs the traffic prediction. When applied to seven real-world traffic datasets of diverse geometric nature, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance with consistency in all datasets. We conclude that the ability of PGCN to progressively adapt to input data enables the model to generalize in different study sites with robustness.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

This position paper argues for the urgent need to consider fairness with respect to location, termed \textit{spatial fairness}, by outlining the harms that continue to be perpetuated due to location's correlation with protected characteristics. This interdisciplinary work connects knowledge from fields such as public policy, economic development, and geography to highlight how fair-AI research currently falls short of correcting for spatial biases, and does not consider challenges unique to spatial data. Furthermore, we identify limitations of the handful of spatial fairness work proposed so far, and finally, detail guidelines for future research so subsequent work may avoid such issues and help correct spatial biases.</p></details> |  |

A key theme in existing GCD approaches is adapting large-scale pre-trained models for the GCD task. An alternate perspective, however, is to adapt the data representation itself for better alignment with the pre-trained model. As such, in this paper, we introduce a two-stage adaptation approach termed SPTNet, which iteratively optimizes model parameters (i.e., model-finetuning) and data parameters (i.e., prompt learning). Furthermore, we propose a novel spatial prompt tuning method (SPT) which considers the spatial property of image data, enabling the method to better focus on object parts, which can transfer between seen and unseen classes. We thoroughly evaluate our SPTNet on standard benchmarks and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing GCD methods. Notably, we find our method achieves an average accuracy of 61.4% on the SSB, surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods by approximately 10%.

| **[Spatial-Temporal Graph Representation Learning for Tactical Networks Future State Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13872v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resource allocation in tactical ad-hoc networks presents unique challenges due to their dynamic and multi-hop nature. Accurate prediction of future network connectivity is essential for effective resource allocation in such environments. In this paper, we introduce the Spatial-Temporal Graph Encoder-Decoder (STGED) framework for Tactical Communication Networks that leverages both spatial and temporal features of network states to learn latent tactical behaviors effectively. STGED hierarchically utilizes graph-based attention mechanism to spatially encode a series of communication network states, leverages a recurrent neural network to temporally encode the evolution of states, and a fully-connected feed-forward network to decode the connectivity in the future state. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that STGED consistently outperforms baseline models by large margins across different time-steps input, achieving an accuracy of up to 99.2\% for the future state prediction task of tactical communication networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Spatial Relations in Text-Only Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13666v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper shows that text-only Language Models (LM) can learn to ground spatial relations like "left of" or "below" if they are provided with explicit location information of objects and they are properly trained to leverage those locations. We perform experiments on a verbalized version of the Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) dataset, where images are coupled with textual statements which contain real or fake spatial relations between two objects of the image. We verbalize the images using an off-the-shelf object detector, adding location tokens to every object label to represent their bounding boxes in textual form. Given the small size of VSR, we do not observe any improvement when using locations, but pretraining the LM over a synthetic dataset automatically derived by us improves results significantly when using location tokens. We thus show that locations allow LMs to ground spatial relations, with our text-only LMs outperforming Vision-and-Language Models and setting the new state-of-the-art for the VSR dataset. Our analysis show that our text-only LMs can generalize beyond the relations seen in the synthetic dataset to some extent, learning also more useful information than that encoded in the spatial rules we used to create the synthetic dataset itself.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Neural Networks</p></details> |

| **[Video Anomaly Detection via Spatio-Temporal Pseudo-Anomaly Generation : A Unified Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16514v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is an open-set recognition task, which is usually formulated as a one-class classification (OCC) problem, where training data is comprised of videos with normal instances while test data contains both normal and anomalous instances. Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChangeMamba: Remote Sensing Change Detection with Spatio-Temporal State Space Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03425v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformers have made impressive progress in the field of remote sensing change detection (CD). However, both architectures have their inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on spatial state models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing change detection tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features and obtain accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.04% SeK; and on the xBD dataset, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score.

| **[Personalized Federated Learning for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting: A Dual Semantic Alignment-Based Contrastive Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03702v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing federated learning (FL) methods for spatio-temporal forecasting fail to capture the inherent spatio-temporal heterogeneity, which calls for personalized FL (PFL) methods to model the spatio-temporally variant patterns. While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

This is used to obtain an asymptotic Wald test for testing the significance of individual or group effects.

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Regardless of the recipient, the message space and time scale could be too fast, too slow, too large, or too small and may never be decoded. Therefore, it pays to devise a way to encode messages agnostic of space and time scales. We propose the use of fractal functions as self-executable infinite-frequency carriers for sending messages, given their properties of structural self-similarity and scale invariance. We call it `fractal messaging'. Starting from a spatial embedding, we introduce a framework for a space-time scale-free messaging approach to this challenge. When considering a space and time-agnostic framework for message transmission, it would be interesting to encode a message such that it could be decoded at several spatio-temporal scales. Hence, the core idea of the framework proposed herein is to encode a binary message as waves along infinitely many frequencies (in power-like distributions) and amplitudes, transmit such a message, and then decode and reproduce it. To do so, the components of the Weierstrass function, a known fractal, are used as carriers of the message. Each component will have its amplitude modulated to embed the binary stream, allowing for a space-time-agnostic approach to messaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages + appendix (21 pages total)</p></details> |
| **[UrbanGPT: Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00813v2)** | 2024-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal prediction aims to forecast and gain insights into the ever-changing dynamics of urban environments across both time and space. Its purpose is to anticipate future patterns, trends, and events in diverse facets of urban life, including transportation, population movement, and crime rates. Although numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing neural network techniques for accurate predictions on spatio-temporal data, it is important to note that many of these methods heavily depend on having sufficient labeled data to generate precise spatio-temporal representations. Unfortunately, the issue of data scarcity is pervasive in practical urban sensing scenarios. Consequently, it becomes necessary to build a spatio-temporal model with strong generalization capabilities across diverse spatio-temporal learning scenarios. Taking inspiration from the remarkable achievements of large language models (LLMs), our objective is to create a spatio-temporal LLM that can exhibit exceptional generalization capabilities across a wide range of downstream urban tasks. To achieve this objective, we present the UrbanGPT, which seamlessly integrates a spatio-temporal dependency encoder with the instruction-tuning paradigm. This integration enables LLMs to comprehend the complex inter-dependencies across time and space, facilitating more comprehensive and accurate predictions under data scarcity. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on various public datasets, covering different spatio-temporal prediction tasks. The results consistently demonstrate that our UrbanGPT, with its carefully designed architecture, consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. These findings highlight the potential of building large language models for spatio-temporal learning, particularly in zero-shot scenarios where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> | 11 pages |

This paper addresses a critical limitation in current video grounding methodologies by introducing an Open-Vocabulary Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding task. Unlike prevalent closed-set approaches that struggle with open-vocabulary scenarios due to limited training data and predefined vocabularies, our model leverages pre-trained representations from foundational spatial grounding models. This empowers it to effectively bridge the semantic gap between natural language and diverse visual content, achieving strong performance in closed-set and open-vocabulary settings. Our contributions include a novel spatio-temporal video grounding model, surpassing state-of-the-art results in closed-set evaluations on multiple datasets and demonstrating superior performance in open-vocabulary scenarios. Notably, the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods in closed-set settings on VidSTG (Declarative and Interrogative) and HC-STVG (V1 and V2) datasets. Furthermore, in open-vocabulary evaluations on HC-STVG V1 and YouCook-Interactions, our model surpasses the recent best-performing models by $4.88$ m_vIoU and $1.83\%$ accuracy, demonstrating its efficacy in handling diverse linguistic and visual concepts for improved video understanding.

These models provide several benefits over other types of generative models due to their training stability, invertibility and efficiency in sampling and inference. This makes them a suitable candidate for stochastic spatio-temporal prediction problems, which are omnipresent in many fields of sciences, such as earth sciences, astrophysics or molecular sciences. In this paper, we present conditional normalizing flows for stochastic spatio-temporal modelling. The method is evaluated on the task of daily temperature and hourly geopotential map prediction from ERA5 datasets. Experiments show that our method is able to capture spatio-temporal correlations and extrapolates well beyond the time horizon used during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Wrong...</summary><p>Wrong version, will upload a new one</p></details> |

Dominant pipelines propose to tackle the visual discrepancies with additional temporal learners while overlooking the substantial discrepancy for web-scaled descriptive narratives and concise action category names, leading to less distinct semantic space and potential performance limitations. In this work, we prioritize the refinement of text knowledge to facilitate generalizable video recognition. To address the limitations of the less distinct semantic space of category names, we prompt a large language model (LLM) to augment action class names into Spatio-Temporal Descriptors thus bridging the textual discrepancy and serving as a knowledge base for general recognition. Moreover, to assign the best descriptors with different video instances, we propose Optimal Descriptor Solver, forming the video recognition problem as solving the optimal matching flow across frame-level representations and descriptors. Comprehensive evaluations in zero-shot, few-shot, and fully supervised video recognition highlight the effectiveness of our approach. Our best model achieves a state-of-the-art zero-shot accuracy of 75.1% on Kinetics-600.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report.

To correctly exploit the provided information by each sensor in a single common frame, it is essential for these sensors to be accurately calibrated. In this paper, we leverage the ability of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) to represent different sensors modalities in a common volumetric representation to achieve robust and accurate spatio-temporal sensor calibration. By designing a partitioning approach based on the visible part of the scene for each sensor, we formulate the calibration problem using only the overlapping areas. This strategy results in a more robust and accurate calibration that is less prone to failure. We demonstrate that our approach works on outdoor urban scenes by validating it on multiple established driving datasets. Results show that our method is able to get better accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2024.

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction. The implementation of our approach is available: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GPD.</p></details> |  |

Malicious users can easily create non-existent videos to spread false information. This letter proposes an effective AI-generated video detection (AIGVDet) scheme by capturing the forensic traces with a two-branch spatio-temporal convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, two ResNet sub-detectors are learned separately for identifying the anomalies in spatical and optical flow domains, respectively. Results of such sub-detectors are fused to further enhance the discrimination ability. A large-scale generated video dataset (GVD) is constructed as a benchmark for model training and evaluation.

The accuracy of expression spotting is affected not only by irrelevant facial movements but also by the difficulty of perceiving subtle motions in micro-expressions. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Scale Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network (SpoT-GCN) for facial expression spotting. To extract more robust motion features, we track both short- and long-term motion of facial muscles in compact sliding windows whose window length adapts to the temporal receptive field of the network. This strategy, termed the receptive field adaptive sliding window strategy, effectively magnifies the motion features while alleviating the problem of severe head movement. The subtle motion features are then converted to a facial graph representation, whose spatio-temporal graph patterns are learned by a graph convolutional network. This network learns both local and global features from multiple scales of facial graph structures using our proposed facial local graph pooling (FLGP). Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning to enhance the discriminative capability of our model for difficult-to-classify frames. The experimental results on the SAMM-LV and CAS(ME)^2 datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly in micro-expression spotting. Ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of our proposed modules.</p></details> | Accepted by FG2024 |

However, existing methods, which depend solely on appearance matching via Siamese networks or utilize motion information from successive frames, encounter significant challenges. Issues such as similar objects nearby or occlusions can result in tracker drift. To mitigate these challenges, we design an innovative spatio-temporal bi-directional cross-frame distractor filtering tracker, named STMD-Tracker. Our first step involves the creation of a 4D multi-frame spatio-temporal graph convolution backbone. This design separates KNN graph spatial embedding and incorporates 1D temporal convolution, effectively capturing temporal fluctuations and spatio-temporal information. Subsequently, we devise a novel bi-directional cross-frame memory procedure. This integrates future and synthetic past frame memory to enhance the current memory, thereby improving the accuracy of iteration-based tracking. This iterative memory update mechanism allows our tracker to dynamically compensate for information in the current frame, effectively reducing tracker drift. Lastly, we construct spatially reliable Gaussian masks on the fused features to eliminate distractor points. This is further supplemented by an object-aware sampling strategy, which bolsters the efficiency and precision of object localization, thereby reducing tracking errors caused by distractors. Our extensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses the current state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 18 pages,6 figures |

PAR presents two major challenges: 1) recognizing the nuanced interactions among numerous individuals and 2) understanding multi-granular human activities. To address these, we propose Social Proximity-aware Dual-Path Network (SPDP-Net) based on two key design principles. First, while previous works often focus on spatial distance among individuals within an image, we argue to consider the spatio-temporal proximity. It is crucial for individual relation encoding to correctly understand social dynamics. Secondly, deviating from existing hierarchical approaches (individual-to-social-to-global activity), we introduce a dual-path architecture for multi-granular activity recognition. This architecture comprises individual-to-global and individual-to-social paths, mutually reinforcing each other's task with global-local context through multiple layers. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness of the spatio-temporal proximity among individuals and the dual-path architecture in PAR. Furthermore, SPDP-Net achieves new state-of-the-art performance with 46.5\% of overall F1 score on JRDB-PAR dataset.</p></details> |  |

But coarse, heterogeneous aggregations complicate learning and integration for downstream AI/ML systems. In this work, we consider models to disaggregate spatio-temporal data from a low-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., census tract) to a high-resolution, irregular partition (e.g., city block). We propose a model, Gated Recurrent Unit with Spatial Attention ($GRU^{spa}$), where spatial attention layers are integrated into the original Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model. The spatial attention layers capture spatial interactions among regions, while the gated recurrent module captures the temporal dependencies. Additionally, we utilize containment relationships between different geographic levels (e.g., when a given city block is wholly contained in a given census tract) to constrain the spatial attention layers. For situations where limited historical training data is available, we study transfer learning scenarios and show that a model pre-trained on one city variable can be fine-tuned for another city variable using only a few hundred samples. Evaluating these techniques on two mobility datasets, we find that $GRU^{spa}$ provides a significant improvement over other neural models as well as typical heuristic methods, allowing us to synthesize realistic point data over small regions useful for training downstream models.</p></details> |  |

Recent machine learning research efforts have focused on the application of screening various diseases using ECG signals. However, adapting to the application of screening disease is challenging in that labeled ECG data are limited. Achieving general representation through self-supervised learning (SSL) is a well-known approach to overcome the scarcity of labeled data; however, a naive application of SSL to ECG data, without considering the spatial-temporal relationships inherent in ECG signals, may yield suboptimal results. In this paper, we introduce ST-MEM (Spatio-Temporal Masked Electrocardiogram Modeling), designed to learn spatio-temporal features by reconstructing masked 12-lead ECG data. ST-MEM outperforms other SSL baseline methods in various experimental settings for arrhythmia classification tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that ST-MEM is adaptable to various lead combinations.

| **[LIST: Learning to Index Spatio-Textual Data for Embedding based Spatial Keyword Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07331v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the proliferation of spatio-textual data, Top-k KNN spatial keyword queries (TkQs), which return a list of objects based on a ranking function that evaluates both spatial and textual relevance, have found many real-life applications. Existing geo-textual indexes for TkQs use traditional retrieval models like BM25 to compute text relevance and usually exploit a simple linear function to compute spatial relevance, but its effectiveness is limited. To improve effectiveness, several deep learning models have recently been proposed, but they suffer severe efficiency issues. To the best of our knowledge, there are no efficient indexes specifically designed to accelerate the top-k search process for these deep learning models. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel technique, which Learns to Index the Spatio-Textual data for answering embedding based spatial keyword queries (called LIST). LIST is featured with two novel components. Firstly, we propose a lightweight and effective relevance model that is capable of learning both textual and spatial relevance. Secondly, we introduce a novel machine learning based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) index, which utilizes a new learning-to-cluster technique to group relevant queries and objects together while separating irrelevant queries and objects. Two key challenges in building an effective and efficient index are the absence of high-quality labels and unbalanced clustering results. We develop a novel pseudo-label generation technique to address the two challenges. Experimental results show that LIST significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on effectiveness, with improvements up to 19.21% and 12.79% in terms of NDCG@1 and Recall@10, and is three orders of magnitude faster than the most effective baseline.</p></details> |  |

Our focus lies in the parametric estimation of its intensity function, incorporating both spatial factors (such as altitude) and spatio-temporal covariates (such as field temperature, precipitation, etc.). The events are observed in France over a span of three years. Spatio-temporal covariates are observed with resolution $0.1^\circ \times 0.1^\circ$ ($\approx 100$km$^2$) and six-hour periods. This results in an extensive dataset, further characterized by a significant excess of zeroes (i.e., spatio-temporal cells with no observed events). We reexamine composite likelihood methods commonly employed for spatial point processes, especially in situations where covariates are piecewise constant. Additionally, we extend these methods to account for zero-deflated subsampling, a strategy involving dependent subsampling, with a focus on selecting more cells in regions where events are observed. A simulation study is conducted to illustrate these novel methodologies, followed by their application to the dataset of lightning strikes.</p></details> |  |

It automatically decomposes the given task into smaller, more manageable subtasks, and thus enables sparse decision-making and focused computation on the relevant parts of the environment. The decomposition relies on the extraction of an abstracted proxy problem represented as a directed graph, in which vertices and edges are learned end-to-end from hindsight. Our theoretical analyses provide performance guarantees under appropriate assumptions and establish where our approach is expected to be helpful. Generalization-focused experiments validate Skipper's significant advantage in zero-shot generalization, compared to some existing state-of-the-art hierarchical planning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 Camera-Ready</p></details> |

| **[Bayesian Design for Sampling Anomalous Spatio-Temporal Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10791v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data collected from arrays of sensors are essential for informed decision-making in various systems. However, the presence of anomalies can compromise the accuracy and reliability of insights drawn from the collected data or information obtained via statistical analysis. This study aims to develop a robust Bayesian optimal experimental design (BOED) framework with anomaly detection methods for high-quality data collection. We introduce a general framework that involves anomaly generation, detection and error scoring when searching for an optimal design. This method is demonstrated using two comprehensive simulated case studies: the first study uses a spatial dataset, and the second uses a spatio-temporal river network dataset. As a baseline approach, we employed a commonly used prediction-based utility function based on minimising errors. Results illustrate the trade-off between predictive accuracy and anomaly detection performance for our method under various design scenarios. An optimal design robust to anomalies ensures the collection and analysis of more trustworthy data, playing a crucial role in understanding the dynamics of complex systems such as the environment, therefore enabling informed decisions in monitoring, management, and response.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal Occupancy Models with INLA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10680v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern methods for quantifying and predicting species distribution play a crucial part in biodiversity conservation. Occupancy models are a popular choice for analyzing species occurrence data as they allow to separate the observational error induced by imperfect detection, and the sources of bias affecting the occupancy process. However, the spatial and temporal variation in occupancy not accounted for by environmental covariates is often ignored or modelled through simple spatial structures as the computational costs of fitting explicit spatio-temporal models is too high. In this work, we demonstrate how INLA may be used to fit complex occupancy models and how the R-INLA package can provide a user-friendly interface to make such complex models available to users. We show how occupancy models, provided some simplification on the detection process, can be framed as latent Gaussian models and benefit from the powerful INLA machinery. A large selection of complex modelling features, and random effect modelshave already been implemented in R-INLA. These become available for occupancy models, providing the user with an efficient and flexible toolbox. We illustrate how INLA provides a computationally efficient framework for developing and fitting complex occupancy models using two case studies. Through these, we show how different spatio-temporal models that include spatial-varying trends, smooth terms, and spatio-temporal random effects can be fitted. At the cost of limiting the complexity of the detection model, INLA can incorporate a range of complex structures in the process. INLA-based occupancy models provide an alternative framework to fit complex spatiotemporal occupancy models. The need for new and more flexible computationally approaches to fit such models makes INLA an attractive option for addressing complex ecological problems, and a promising area of research.</p></details> |  |

However, estimating incidence or mortality rates associated with rare cancers presents important difficulties and poses new statistical methodological challenges. In this paper, we expand the collection of multivariate spatio-temporal models by introducing adaptable shared interactions to enable a comprehensive analysis of both incidence and cancer mortality in rare cancer cases. These models allow the modulation of spatio-temporal interactions between incidence and mortality, allowing for changes in their relationship over time. The new models have been implemented in INLA using r-generic constructions. We conduct a simulation study to evaluate the performance of the new spatio-temporal models in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Results show that multivariate spatio-temporal models with flexible shared interaction outperform conventional multivariate spatio-temporal models with independent interactions. We use these models to analyze incidence and mortality data for pancreatic cancer and leukaemia among males across 142 administrative healthcare districts of Great Britain over a span of nine biennial periods (2002-2019).</p></details> | 39 pages, 12 figures |

However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Experimental results showcase PASTA's superiority over current SOTA methods in both visual quality and performance metrics, accompanied by a substantial 3-fold (x3) increase in inference speed.</p></details> |  |

The Segment Anything Model (SAM), known for its accurate segmentation and zero-shot generalization, has not yet been tailored for CMR 2D+T segmentation. We therefore introduce CMR2D+T-SAM, a novel approach to adapt SAM for CMR 2D+T segmentation using spatio-temporal adaption. This approach also incorporates a U-Net framework for multi-scale feature extraction, as well as text prompts for accurate segmentation on both short-axis (SAX) and long-axis (LAX) views using a single model. CMR2D+T-SAM outperforms existing deep learning methods on the STACOM2011 dataset, achieving a myocardium Dice score of 0.885 and a Hausdorff distance (HD) of 2.900 pixels. It also demonstrates superior zero-shot generalization on the ACDC dataset with a Dice score of 0.840 and a HD of 4.076 pixels.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Autoregressive Queries for Adaptive Tracking with Spatio-TemporalTransformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10574v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rich spatio-temporal information is crucial to capture the complicated target appearance variations in visual tracking. However, most top-performing tracking algorithms rely on many hand-crafted components for spatio-temporal information aggregation. Consequently, the spatio-temporal information is far away from being fully explored. To alleviate this issue, we propose an adaptive tracker with spatio-temporal transformers (named AQATrack), which adopts simple autoregressive queries to effectively learn spatio-temporal information without many hand-designed components. Firstly, we introduce a set of learnable and autoregressive queries to capture the instantaneous target appearance changes in a sliding window fashion. Then, we design a novel attention mechanism for the interaction of existing queries to generate a new query in current frame. Finally, based on the initial target template and learnt autoregressive queries, a spatio-temporal information fusion module (STM) is designed for spatiotemporal formation aggregation to locate a target object. Benefiting from the STM, we can effectively combine the static appearance and instantaneous changes to guide robust tracking. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly improves the tracker's performance on six popular tracking benchmarks: LaSOT, LaSOText, TrackingNet, GOT-10k, TNL2K, and UAV123.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spatio-temporal methods for estimating subsurface ocean thermal response to tropical cyclones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2012.15130v5)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tropical cyclones (TCs), driven by heat exchange between the air and sea, pose a substantial risk to many communities around the world. Accurate characterization of the subsurface ocean thermal response to TC passage is crucial for accurate TC intensity forecasts and for an understanding of the role that TCs play in the global climate system. However, that characterization is complicated by the high-noise ocean environment, correlations inherent in spatio-temporal data, relative scarcity of in situ observations, and the entanglement of the TC-induced signal with seasonal signals. We present a general methodological framework that addresses these difficulties, integrating existing techniques in seasonal mean field estimation, Gaussian process modeling, and nonparametric regression into an ANOVA decomposition model. Importantly, we improve upon past work by properly handling seasonality, providing rigorous uncertainty quantification, and treating time as a continuous variable, rather than producing estimates that are binned in time. This ANOVA model is estimated using in situ subsurface temperature profiles from the Argo fleet of autonomous floats through a multi-step procedure, which (1) characterizes the upper ocean seasonal shift during the TC season; (2) models the variability in the temperature observations; (3) fits a thin plate spline using the variability estimates to account for heteroskedasticity and correlation between the observations. This spline fit reveals the ocean thermal response to TC passage. Through this framework, we obtain new scientific insights into the interaction between TCs and the ocean on a global scale, including a three-dimensional characterization of the near-surface and subsurface cooling along the TC storm track and the mixing-induced subsurface warming on the track's right side.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 14 figures; supplement and code at https://github.com/huisaddison/tc-ocean-methods</p></details> |

The method tested on 102 video scenes demonstrates 94.1% reduction in complexity versus brute-force at 1.71% BD-Rate expense.

| **[CINA: Conditional Implicit Neural Atlas for Spatio-Temporal Representation of Fetal Brains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08550v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a conditional implicit neural atlas (CINA) for spatio-temporal atlas generation from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of the neurotypical and pathological fetal brain, that is fully independent of affine or non-rigid registration. During training, CINA learns a general representation of the fetal brain and encodes subject specific information into latent code. After training, CINA can construct a faithful atlas with tissue probability maps of the fetal brain for any gestational age (GA) and anatomical variation covered within the training domain. Thus, CINA is competent to represent both, neurotypical and pathological brains. Furthermore, a trained CINA model can be fit to brain MRI of unseen subjects via test-time optimization of the latent code. CINA can then produce probabilistic tissue maps tailored to a particular subject. We evaluate our method on a total of 198 T2 weighted MRI of normal and abnormal fetal brains from the dHCP and FeTA datasets. We demonstrate CINA's capability to represent a fetal brain atlas that can be flexibly conditioned on GA and on anatomical variations like ventricular volume or degree of cortical folding, making it a suitable tool for modeling both neurotypical and pathological brains. We quantify the fidelity of our atlas by means of tissue segmentation and age prediction and compare it to an established baseline. CINA demonstrates superior accuracy for neurotypical brains and pathological brains with ventriculomegaly. Moreover, CINA scores a mean absolute error of 0.23 weeks in fetal brain age prediction, further confirming an accurate representation of fetal brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[Process signature-driven high spatio-temporal resolution alignment of multimodal data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06888v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present HiRA-Pro, a novel procedure to align, at high spatio-temporal resolutions, multimodal signals from real-world processes and systems that exhibit diverse transient, nonlinear stochastic dynamics, such as manufacturing machines. It is based on discerning and synchronizing the process signatures of salient kinematic and dynamic events in these disparate signals. HiRA-Pro addresses the challenge of aligning data with sub-millisecond phenomena, where traditional timestamp, external trigger, or clock-based alignment methods fall short. The effectiveness of HiRA-Pro is demonstrated in a smart manufacturing context, where it aligns data from 13+ channels acquired during 3D-printing and milling operations on an Optomec-LENS MTS 500 hybrid machine. The aligned data is then voxelized to generate 0.25 second aligned data chunks that correspond to physical voxels on the produced part. The superiority of HiRA-Pro is further showcased through case studies in additive manufacturing, demonstrating improved machine learning-based predictive performance due to precise multimodal data alignment. Specifically, testing classification accuracies improved by almost 35% with the application of HiRA-Pro, even with limited data, allowing for precise localization of artifacts. The paper also provides a comprehensive discussion on the proposed method, its applications, and comparative qualitative analysis with a few other alignment methods. HiRA-Pro achieves temporal-spatial resolutions of 10-1000 us and 100 um in order to generate datasets that register with physical voxels on the 3D-printed and milled part. These resolutions are at least an order of magnitude finer than the existing alignment methods that employ individual timestamps, statistical correlations, or common clocks, which achieve precision of hundreds of milliseconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[JSTR: Joint Spatio-Temporal Reasoning for Event-based Moving Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07436v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based moving object detection is a challenging task, where static background and moving object are mixed together. Typically, existing methods mainly align the background events to the same spatial coordinate system via motion compensation to distinguish the moving object. However, they neglect the potential spatial tailing effect of moving object events caused by excessive motion, which may affect the structure integrity of the extracted moving object. We discover that the moving object has a complete columnar structure in the point cloud composed of motion-compensated events along the timestamp. Motivated by this, we propose a novel joint spatio-temporal reasoning method for event-based moving object detection. Specifically, we first compensate the motion of background events using inertial measurement unit. In spatial reasoning stage, we project the compensated events into the same image coordinate, discretize the timestamp of events to obtain a time image that can reflect the motion confidence, and further segment the moving object through adaptive threshold on the time image. In temporal reasoning stage, we construct the events into a point cloud along timestamp, and use RANSAC algorithm to extract the columnar shape in the cloud for peeling off the background. Finally, we fuse the results from the two reasoning stages to extract the final moving object region. This joint spatio-temporal reasoning framework can effectively detect the moving object from motion confidence and geometric structure. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on various datasets to verify that the proposed method can improve the moving object detection accuracy by 13\%.</p></details> |  |

This theoretical result can be employed as an estimation method to derive parameter estimates for a particular model assumed for the data. The underlying motivation is to avoid the difficulties associated with dealing with complex likelihoods in point process models and their maximization. The exploited result makes our method theoretically applicable to any model specification. In this paper, we restrict our study to Poisson models, whose likelihood represents the base for many more complex point process models. In this context, our proposed method can estimate the vector of local parameters that correspond to the points within the analyzed point pattern without introducing any additional complexity compared to the global estimation. We illustrate the method through simulation studies for both purely spatial and spatio-temporal point processes and show complex scenarios based on the Poisson model through the analysis of two real datasets concerning environmental problems.</p></details> |  |

Tangible cubes, with their rich interaction affordances, high maneuverability, and stable structure, are particularly well-suited for exploring multi-dimensional data types. However, the design potential of these cubes is underexplored. This study introduces a design space for tangible cubes in MR, focusing on interaction space, visualization space, sizes, and multiplicity. Using spatio-temporal data, we explored the interaction affordances of these cubes in a workshop (N=24). We identified unique interactions like rotating, tapping, and stacking, which are linked to augmented reality (AR) visualization commands. Integrating user-identified interactions, we created a design space for tangible-cube interactions and visualization. A prototype visualizing global health spending with small cubes was developed and evaluated, supporting both individual and combined cube manipulation. This research enhances our grasp of tangible interaction in MR, offering insights for future design and application in diverse data contexts.</p></details> |  |

Temporal localization is challenging because it requires robustness, reliability, and accuracy. In this study, we aim to improve the temporal localization and classification accuracy performance by adapting video action recognition and 2D human-pose estimation networks to one model. Therefore, we design a transformer-based fusion architecture to effectively combine 2D-pose features and spatio-temporal features. The model uses 2D-pose features as the positional embedding of the transformer architecture and spatio-temporal features as the main input to the encoder of the transformer. The proposed solution is generic and independent of the camera numbers and positions, giving frame-based class probabilities as output. Finally, the post-processing step combines information from different camera views to obtain final predictions and eliminate false positives. The model performs well on the A2 test set of the 2023 NVIDIA AI City Challenge for naturalistic driving action recognition, achieving the overlap score of the organizer-defined distracted driver behaviour metric of 0.5079.</p></details> |  |

Pillar-based methods stand out as a practical choice for onboard deployment due to their computational efficiency. However, despite their efficiency, these methods can sometimes underperform compared to alternative point encoding techniques such as Voxel-encoding or PointNet++. We argue that current pillar-based methods have not sufficiently captured the fine-grained distributions of LiDAR points within each pillar structure. Consequently, there exists considerable room for improvement in pillar feature encoding. In this paper, we introduce a novel pillar encoding architecture referred to as Fine-Grained Pillar Feature Encoding (FG-PFE). FG-PFE utilizes Spatio-Temporal Virtual (STV) grids to capture the distribution of point clouds within each pillar across vertical, temporal, and horizontal dimensions. Through STV grids, points within each pillar are individually encoded using Vertical PFE (V-PFE), Temporal PFE (T-PFE), and Horizontal PFE (H-PFE). These encoded features are then aggregated through an Attentive Pillar Aggregation method. Our experiments conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that FG-PFE achieves significant performance improvements over baseline models such as PointPillar, CenterPoint-Pillar, and PillarNet, with only a minor increase in computational overhead.</p></details> | ICRA 2024 |

Specifically, VAEs often suffer from blurry generated samples due to the lack of a tailored training on the samples generated in the generative direction. On the other hand, EBMs can generate high-quality samples but require expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. To address these issues, we introduce a conditional EBM for calibrating the generative direction of VAE during training, without requiring it for the generation at test time. In particular, we train EC-VAE upon both the input data and the calibrated samples with adaptive weight to enhance efficacy while avoiding MCMC sampling at test time. Furthermore, we extend the calibration idea of EC-VAE to variational learning and normalizing flows, and apply EC-VAE to an additional application of zero-shot image restoration via neural transport prior and range-null theory. We evaluate the proposed method with two applications, including image generation and zero-shot image restoration, and the experimental results show that our method achieves competitive performance over single-step non-adversarial generation.

The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks.

Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[TIM: A Time Interval Machine for Audio-Visual Action Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05559v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diverse actions give rise to rich audio-visual signals in long videos. Recent works showcase that the two modalities of audio and video exhibit different temporal extents of events and distinct labels. We address the interplay between the two modalities in long videos by explicitly modelling the temporal extents of audio and visual events. We propose the Time Interval Machine (TIM) where a modality-specific time interval poses as a query to a transformer encoder that ingests a long video input. The encoder then attends to the specified interval, as well as the surrounding context in both modalities, in order to recognise the ongoing action. We test TIM on three long audio-visual video datasets: EPIC-KITCHENS, Perception Test, and AVE, reporting state-of-the-art (SOTA) for recognition. On EPIC-KITCHENS, we beat previous SOTA that utilises LLMs and significantly larger pre-training by 2.9% top-1 action recognition accuracy. Additionally, we show that TIM can be adapted for action detection, using dense multi-scale interval queries, outperforming SOTA on EPIC-KITCHENS-100 for most metrics, and showing strong performance on the Perception Test. Our ablations show the critical role of integrating the two modalities and modelling their time intervals in achieving this performance.

While two-stage top-down methods slow down as the number of people in the image increases, existing one-stage methods often fail to simultaneously deliver high accuracy and real-time performance. This paper introduces RTMO, a one-stage pose estimation framework that seamlessly integrates coordinate classification by representing keypoints using dual 1-D heatmaps within the YOLO architecture, achieving accuracy comparable to top-down methods while maintaining high speed. We propose a dynamic coordinate classifier and a tailored loss function for heatmap learning, specifically designed to address the incompatibilities between coordinate classification and dense prediction models. RTMO outperforms state-of-the-art one-stage pose estimators, achieving 1.1% higher AP on COCO while operating about 9 times faster with the same backbone. Our largest model, RTMO-l, attains 74.8% AP on COCO val2017 and 141 FPS on a single V100 GPU, demonstrating its efficiency and accuracy.

Using a traffic light to segregate car and bike flows, with the addition of bike-specific green phases, is a lightweight and cheap solution that can be deployed dynamically to assess the opportunity of a heavier infrastructure such as a separate bike lane. To compensate for the increased waiting time induced by these new phases, we introduce in this paper a deep reinforcement learning solution that adapts the green phase cycle of a traffic light to the traffic. Vehicle counter data are used to compare the DRL approach with the actuated traffic light control algorithm over whole days. Results show that DRL achieves better minimization of vehicle waiting time at almost all hours. Our DRL approach is also robust to moderate changes in bike traffic. The code of this paper is available at https://github.com/LucasMagnana/A-DRL-solution-to-help-reduce-the-cost-in-waiting-time-of-securing-a-traffic-light-for-cyclists.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods, fully relying on implicit representations, are so resource-hungry that they cannot run on portable devices, which deviates from the original intention of SLAM. In this paper, we present Photo-SLAM, a novel SLAM framework with a hyper primitives map. Specifically, we simultaneously exploit explicit geometric features for localization and learn implicit photometric features to represent the texture information of the observed environment. In addition to actively densifying hyper primitives based on geometric features, we further introduce a Gaussian-Pyramid-based training method to progressively learn multi-level features, enhancing photorealistic mapping performance. The extensive experiments with monocular, stereo, and RGB-D datasets prove that our proposed system Photo-SLAM significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art SLAM systems for online photorealistic mapping, e.g., PSNR is 30% higher and rendering speed is hundreds of times faster in the Replica dataset. Moreover, the Photo-SLAM can run at real-time speed using an embedded platform such as Jetson AGX Orin, showing the potential of robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2024.

| **[Fully Automated Verification of Linear Time-Invariant Systems against Signal Temporal Logic Specifications via Reachability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04089v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reachability analysis is one of the most promising approaches for formal verification of dynamic systems, a major disadvantage preventing a more widespread application is the requirement to manually tune algorithm parameters such as the time step size. Manual tuning is especially problematic if one aims to verify that the system satisfies complicated specifications described by signal temporal logic formulas since the effect the tightness of the reachable set has on the satisfaction of the specification is often non-trivial to see for humans. We address this problem with a fully-automated verifier for linear systems, which automatically refines all parameters for reachability analysis until it can either prove or disprove that the system satisfies a signal temporal logic formula for all initial states and all uncertain inputs. Our verifier combines reachset temporal logic with dependency preservation to obtain a model checking approach whose over-approximation error converges to zero for adequately tuned parameters. While we in this work focus on linear systems for simplicity, the general concept we present can equivalently be applied for nonlinear and hybrid systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05426v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization (ZS-TAL) seeks to identify and locate actions in untrimmed videos unseen during training. Existing ZS-TAL methods involve fine-tuning a model on a large amount of annotated training data. While effective, training-based ZS-TAL approaches assume the availability of labeled data for supervised learning, which can be impractical in some applications. Furthermore, the training process naturally induces a domain bias into the learned model, which may adversely affect the model's generalization ability to arbitrary videos. These considerations prompt us to approach the ZS-TAL problem from a radically novel perspective, relaxing the requirement for training data. To this aim, we introduce a novel method that performs Test-Time adaptation for Temporal Action Localization (T3AL). In a nutshell, T3AL adapts a pre-trained Vision and Language Model (VLM). T3AL operates in three steps. First, a video-level pseudo-label of the action category is computed by aggregating information from the entire video. Then, action localization is performed adopting a novel procedure inspired by self-supervised learning. Finally, frame-level textual descriptions extracted with a state-of-the-art captioning model are employed for refining the action region proposals. We validate the effectiveness of T3AL by conducting experiments on the THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that T3AL significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines based on state-of-the-art VLMs, confirming the benefit of a test-time adaptation approach.</p></details> |  |

The time series reach back tens of millions of years, they are relatively sparse in the early record and relatively dense in the later, the time stamps of the observations are not evenly spaced, and there are instances of multiple different observations at the same time stamp. The time series appear non-stationary over most of the historical record with clearly visible temporary trends of varying directions. In this paper, we propose a continuous-time state-space framework to analyze the time series. State space models are uniquely suited for this purpose, since they can accommodate all the challenging features mentioned above. We specify univariate models and joint bivariate models for the two time series of delta-O-18 and delta-C-13. The models are estimated using maximum likelihood by way of the Kalman filter recursions. The suite of models we consider has an interpretation as an application of the Butterworth filter. We propose model specifications that take the origin of the data from different studies into account and that allow for a partition of the total period into sub-periods reflecting different climate states. The models can be used, for example, to impute evenly time-stamped values by way of Kalman filtering. They can also be used, in future work, to analyze the relation to proxies for CO2 concentrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors in alphabetical order</p></details> |
| **[Jammer-Resilient Time Synchronization in the MIMO Uplink](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05335v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial filtering based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing is a promising approach to jammer mitigation. Effective MIMO data detectors that mitigate smart jammers have recently been proposed, but they all assume perfect time synchronization between transmitter(s) and receiver. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no methods for resilient time synchronization in the presence of smart jammers. To remedy this situation, we propose JASS, the first method that enables reliable time synchronization for the single-user MIMO uplink while mitigating smart jamming attacks. JASS detects a randomized synchronization sequence based on a novel optimization problem that fits a spatial filter to the time-windowed receive signal in order to mitigate the jammer. We underscore the efficacy of the proposed optimization problem by proving that it ensures successful time synchronization under certain intuitive conditions. We then derive an efficient algorithm for approximately solving our optimization problem. Finally, we use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of JASS against a wide range of different jammer types.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, a learning control mechanism that acquires nonlinear relationships between joint angles, muscle tensions, and muscle lengths from the actual robot is necessary. In this study, we propose a system which runs the learning control mechanism for a long time to keep the self-body image of the musculoskeletal humanoid correct at all times. Also, we show that the musculoskeletal humanoid can conduct position control, torque control, and variable stiffness control using this self-body image. We conduct a long-time self-body image acquisition experiment lasting 3 hours, evaluate variable stiffness control using the self-body image, etc., and discuss the superiority and practicality of the self-body image acquisition of musculoskeletal structures, comprehensively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters, 2019</p></details> |

Not surprisingly, many forecasting methods are being proposed. To ensure progress, it is essential to be able to study and compare such methods empirically in a comprehensive and reliable manner. To achieve this, we propose TFB, an automated benchmark for Time Series Forecasting (TSF) methods. TFB advances the state-of-the-art by addressing shortcomings related to datasets, comparison methods, and evaluation pipelines: 1) insufficient coverage of data domains, 2) stereotype bias against traditional methods, and 3) inconsistent and inflexible pipelines. To achieve better domain coverage, we include datasets from 10 different domains: traffic, electricity, energy, the environment, nature, economic, stock markets, banking, health, and the web. We also provide a time series characterization to ensure that the selected datasets are comprehensive. To remove biases against some methods, we include a diverse range of methods, including statistical learning, machine learning, and deep learning methods, and we also support a variety of evaluation strategies and metrics to ensure a more comprehensive evaluations of different methods. To support the integration of different methods into the benchmark and enable fair comparisons, TFB features a flexible and scalable pipeline that eliminates biases. Next, we employ TFB to perform a thorough evaluation of 21 Univariate Time Series Forecasting (UTSF) methods on 8,068 univariate time series and 14 Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) methods on 25 datasets.

Data without time labels appear in many applications, such as molecular dynamics, single-cell RNA sequencing etc. Reconstruction of dynamical system from time sequence data has been studied extensively. However, these methods do not apply if time labels are unknown. Without time labels, sequence data becomes distribution data. Based on this observation, we propose to treat the data as samples from a probability distribution and try to reconstruct the underlying dynamical system by minimizing the distribution loss, sliced Wasserstein distance more specifically. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATFNet: Adaptive Time-Frequency Ensembled Network for Long-term Time Series Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05192v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intricate nature of time series data analysis benefits greatly from the distinct advantages offered by time and frequency domain representations. While the time domain is superior in representing local dependencies, particularly in non-periodic series, the frequency domain excels in capturing global dependencies, making it ideal for series with evident periodic patterns. To capitalize on both of these strengths, we propose ATFNet, an innovative framework that combines a time domain module and a frequency domain module to concurrently capture local and global dependencies in time series data. Specifically, we introduce Dominant Harmonic Series Energy Weighting, a novel mechanism for dynamically adjusting the weights between the two modules based on the periodicity of the input time series. In the frequency domain module, we enhance the traditional Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) with our Extended DFT, designed to address the challenge of discrete frequency misalignment. Additionally, our Complex-valued Spectrum Attention mechanism offers a novel approach to discern the intricate relationships between different frequency combinations. Extensive experiments across multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our ATFNet framework outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in long-term time series forecasting.</p></details> |  |

To simultaneously meet these two requirements, this paper uses an $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation and innovatively transforms the resulting non-smooth QP into a box-constrained QP, which is solved by our previously proposed direct and execution-time certified algorithm with only dimension-dependent (data-independent), simple-calculated and exact number of iterations (Wu and Braatz (2023)). This approach not only overcomes the limitation of our previously proposed algorithm (Wu and Braatz (2023)), only applicable to input-constrained MPC, but also enjoys exact recovery feature (exactly recover the same solution when the original problem is feasible) of $\ell_1$ penalty-based soft-constrained MPC formulation without suffering numerical difficulty of the resulting non-smoothness. Other various real-time QP applications, not limited to MPC, would also benefit from our QP algorithm with execution-time certificate and global feasibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to Automatica</p></details> |

The package implements the stratified proportional hazards regression model with piecewise constant hazard within each stratum. The package allows the historical data to inform the treatment effect parameter, parameter effects for other covariates in the regression model, as well as the baseline hazard parameters. The use of multiple historical datasets is supported. A novel algorithm is developed for computationally efficient use of the normalized power prior. In addition, the package supports the use of arbitrary sampling priors for computing Bayesian power and type I error rates, and has built-in features that semi-automatically generate sampling priors from the historical data. We demonstrate the use of BayesPPDSurv in a comprehensive case study for a melanoma clinical trial design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Test-Time Adaptation: Theoretical Analyses and An Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05094v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time adaptation (TTA) addresses distribution shifts for streaming test data in unsupervised settings. Currently, most TTA methods can only deal with minor shifts and rely heavily on heuristic and empirical studies. To advance TTA under domain shifts, we propose the novel problem setting of active test-time adaptation (ATTA) that integrates active learning within the fully TTA setting. We provide a learning theory analysis, demonstrating that incorporating limited labeled test instances enhances overall performances across test domains with a theoretical guarantee. We also present a sample entropy balancing for implementing ATTA while avoiding catastrophic forgetting (CF). We introduce a simple yet effective ATTA algorithm, known as SimATTA, using real-time sample selection techniques. Extensive experimental results confirm consistency with our theoretical analyses and show that the proposed ATTA method yields substantial performance improvements over TTA methods while maintaining efficiency and shares similar effectiveness to the more demanding active domain adaptation (ADA) methods.

| **[Test-Time Training for Depression Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05071v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous works on depression detection use datasets collected in similar environments to train and test the models. In practice, however, the train and test distributions cannot be guaranteed to be identical. Distribution shifts can be introduced due to variations such as recording environment (e.g., background noise) and demographics (e.g., gender, age, etc). Such distributional shifts can surprisingly lead to severe performance degradation of the depression detection models. In this paper, we analyze the application of test-time training (TTT) to improve robustness of models trained for depression detection. When compared to regular testing of the models, we find TTT can significantly improve the robustness of the model under a variety of distributional shifts introduced due to: (a) background-noise, (b) gender-bias, and (c) data collection and curation procedure (i.e., train and test samples are from separate datasets).</p></details> |  |

Self-supervised) representation learning (URL) has emerged as a new paradigm for time series analysis, because it has the ability to learn generalizable time series representation beneficial for many downstream tasks without using labels that are usually difficult to obtain. Considering that existing approaches have limitations in the design of the representation encoder and the learning objective, we have proposed Contrastive Shapelet Learning (CSL), the first URL method that learns the general-purpose shapelet-based representation through unsupervised contrastive learning, and shown its superior performance in several analysis tasks, such as time series classification, clustering, and anomaly detection. In this paper, we develop TimeCSL, an end-to-end system that makes full use of the general and interpretable shapelets learned by CSL to achieve explorable time series analysis in a unified pipeline. We introduce the system components and demonstrate how users interact with TimeCSL to solve different analysis tasks in the unified pipeline, and gain insight into their time series by exploring the learned shapelets and representation.</p></details> |  |

A largely overlooked problem in T2V is that existing models have not adequately encoded physical knowledge of the real world, thus generated videos tend to have limited motion and poor variations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{MagicTime}, a metamorphic time-lapse video generation model, which learns real-world physics knowledge from time-lapse videos and implements metamorphic generation. First, we design a MagicAdapter scheme to decouple spatial and temporal training, encode more physical knowledge from metamorphic videos, and transform pre-trained T2V models to generate metamorphic videos. Second, we introduce a Dynamic Frames Extraction strategy to adapt to metamorphic time-lapse videos, which have a wider variation range and cover dramatic object metamorphic processes, thus embodying more physical knowledge than general videos. Finally, we introduce a Magic Text-Encoder to improve the understanding of metamorphic video prompts. Furthermore, we create a time-lapse video-text dataset called \textbf{ChronoMagic}, specifically curated to unlock the metamorphic video generation ability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of MagicTime for generating high-quality and dynamic metamorphic videos, suggesting time-lapse video generation is a promising path toward building metamorphic simulators of the physical world.</p></details> |  |

In our earlier work, we focussed on providing the error analysis for both the semidiscretization of the Maxwell's equations using an implicit leapfrog scheme that we invented as well as providing the error analysis for the full discretization using this time domain scheme in conjunction with higher order mixed finite elements from finite element exterior calculus. In this work, we record our initial results with extending our implicit leapfrog scheme from being a discretization that is second order accurate in time to an arbitrary (even) order accurate in time method. Towards this end, we provide here the complete error analysis for the semidiscretization in time and full discretization of the Maxwell's equations for the fourth order scheme. We leave the completion of our efforts in providing all the necessary proofs for the general scheme to an immediate future update of this work.</p></details> |  |

Fast deterministic set partitioning under the asymptotic rank conjecture](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04987v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we further explore the recently discovered connection by Bj\"{o}rklund and Kaski [STOC 2024] and Pratt [STOC 2024] between the asymptotic rank conjecture of Strassen [Progr. Math. 1994] and the three-way partitioning problem. We show that under the asymptotic rank conjecture, the chromatic number of an $n$-vertex graph can be computed deterministically in $O(1.99982^n)$ time, thus giving a conditional answer to a question of Zamir [ICALP 2021], and questioning the optimality of the $2^n\operatorname{poly}(n)$ time algorithm for chromatic number by Bj\"{o}rklund, Husfeldt, and Koivisto [SICOMP 2009]. Our technique is a combination of earlier algorithms for detecting $k$-colorings for small $k$ and enumerating $k$-colorable subgraphs, with an extension and derandomisation of Pratt's tensor-based algorithm for balanced three-way partitioning to the unbalanced case.</p></details> |  |

However, RNNs usually suffer from the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients in standard RNN training. Reservoir computing (RC), a special RNN where the recurrent weights are randomized and left untrained, has been introduced to overcome these issues and has demonstrated superior empirical performance especially in scenarios where training samples are extremely limited. On the other hand, the theoretical grounding to support this observed performance has yet been fully developed. In this work, we show that RC can universally approximate a general linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Specifically, we present a clear signal processing interpretation of RC and utilize this understanding in the problem of approximating a generic LTI system. Under this setup, we analytically characterize the optimum probability density function for configuring (instead of training and/or randomly generating) the recurrent weights of the underlying RNN of the RC. Extensive numerical evaluations are provided to validate the optimality of the derived distribution for configuring the recurrent weights of the RC to approximate a general LTI system. Our work results in clear signal processing-based model interpretability of RC and provides theoretical explanation/justification for the power of randomness in randomly generating instead of training RC's recurrent weights. Furthermore, it provides a complete optimum analytical characterization for configuring the untrained recurrent weights, marking an important step towards explainable machine learning (XML) to incorporate domain knowledge for efficient learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted to IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing (JSTSP).

Most of the existing anomaly detection methods focus on learning the normal behaviour of unlabelled time series in an unsupervised manner. The normal boundary is often defined tightly, resulting in slight deviations being classified as anomalies, consequently leading to a high false positive rate and a limited ability to generalise normal patterns. To address this, we introduce a novel end-to-end self-supervised ContrAstive Representation Learning approach for time series Anomaly detection (CARLA). While existing contrastive learning methods assume that augmented time series windows are positive samples and temporally distant windows are negative samples, we argue that these assumptions are limited as augmentation of time series can transform them to negative samples, and a temporally distant window can represent a positive sample. Our contrastive approach leverages existing generic knowledge about time series anomalies and injects various types of anomalies as negative samples. Therefore, CARLA not only learns normal behaviour but also learns deviations indicating anomalies. It creates similar representations for temporally closed windows and distinct ones for anomalies. Additionally, it leverages the information about representations' neighbours through a self-supervised approach to classify windows based on their nearest/furthest neighbours to further enhance the performance of anomaly detection. In extensive tests on seven major real-world time series anomaly detection datasets, CARLA shows superior performance over state-of-the-art self-supervised and unsupervised TSAD methods. Our research shows the potential of contrastive representation learning to advance time series anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in computer vision and natural language processing, this paper aims to discuss the potential of large time series models in load forecasting with scarce historical data. Specifically, the large time series model is constructed as a time series generative pre-trained transformer (TimeGPT), which is trained on massive and diverse time series datasets consisting of 100 billion data points (e.g., finance, transportation, banking, web traffic, weather, energy, healthcare, etc.). Then, the scarce historical load data is used to fine-tune the TimeGPT, which helps it to adapt to the data distribution and characteristics associated with load forecasting. Simulation results show that TimeGPT outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., popular machine learning models and statistical models) for load forecasting on several real datasets with scarce training samples, particularly for short look-ahead times. However, it cannot be guaranteed that TimeGPT is always superior to benchmarks for load forecasting with scarce data, since the performance of TimeGPT may be affected by the distribution differences between the load data and the training data. In practical applications, we can divide the historical data into a training set and a validation set, and then use the validation set loss to decide whether TimeGPT is the best choice for a specific dataset.</p></details> | 10 pages |

However, effectively training large-scale 3DGS and rendering it in real-time across various scales remains challenging. This paper introduces CityGaussian (CityGS), which employs a novel divide-and-conquer training approach and Level-of-Detail (LoD) strategy for efficient large-scale 3DGS training and rendering. Specifically, the global scene prior and adaptive training data selection enables efficient training and seamless fusion.

| **[Inference-Time Rule Eraser: Distilling and Removing Bias Rules to Mitigate Bias in Deployed Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04814v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness is critical for artificial intelligence systems, especially for those deployed in high-stakes applications such as hiring and justice. Existing efforts toward fairness in machine learning fairness require retraining or fine-tuning the neural network weights to meet the fairness criteria. However, this is often not feasible in practice for regular model users due to the inability to access and modify model weights. In this paper, we propose a more flexible fairness paradigm, Inference-Time Rule Eraser, or simply Eraser, which considers the case where model weights can not be accessed and tackles fairness issues from the perspective of biased rules removal at inference-time. We first verified the feasibility of modifying the model output to wipe the biased rule through Bayesian analysis, and deduced Inference-Time Rule Eraser via subtracting the logarithmic value associated with unfair rules (i.e., the model's response to biased features) from the model's logits output as a means of removing biased rules. Moreover, we present a specific implementation of Rule Eraser that involves two stages: (1) limited queries are performed on the model with inaccessible weights to distill its biased rules into an additional patched model, and (2) during inference time, the biased rules already distilled into the patched model are excluded from the output of the original model, guided by the removal strategy outlined in Rule Eraser. Exhaustive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed Rule Eraser in addressing fairness concerns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Channel Dependence for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting: Learning from Leading Indicators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17548v4)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, channel-independent methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance in multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Despite reducing overfitting risks, these methods miss potential opportunities in utilizing channel dependence for accurate predictions. We argue that there exist locally stationary lead-lag relationships between variates, i.e., some lagged variates may follow the leading indicators within a short time period. Exploiting such channel dependence is beneficial since leading indicators offer advance information that can be used to reduce the forecasting difficulty of the lagged variates. In this paper, we propose a new method named LIFT that first efficiently estimates leading indicators and their leading steps at each time step and then judiciously allows the lagged variates to utilize the advance information from leading indicators. LIFT plays as a plugin that can be seamlessly collaborated with arbitrary time series forecasting methods. Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate that LIFT improves the state-of-the-art methods by 5.5% in average forecasting performance.

Buchi and Landweber provided a procedure to solve the Church problem for MSO specifications and operators computable by finite-state automata. We investigate a generalization of the Church synthesis problem to the continuous time of the non-negative reals. We show that in the continuous time there are phenomena which are very different from the canonical discrete time domain of the natural numbers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bipartite causal inference with interference, time series data, and a random network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04775v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In bipartite causal inference with interference there are two distinct sets of units: those that receive the treatment, termed interventional units, and those on which the outcome is measured, termed outcome units. Which interventional units' treatment can drive which outcome units' outcomes is often depicted in a bipartite network. We study bipartite causal inference with interference from observational data across time and with a changing bipartite network. Under an exposure mapping framework, we define causal effects specific to each outcome unit, representing average contrasts of potential outcomes across time. We establish unconfoundedness of the exposure received by the outcome units based on unconfoundedness assumptions on the interventional units' treatment assignment and the random graph, hence respecting the bipartite structure of the problem. By harvesting the time component of our setting, causal effects are estimable while controlling only for temporal trends and time-varying confounders. Our results hold for binary, continuous, and multivariate exposure mappings. In the case of a binary exposure, we propose three matching algorithms to estimate the causal effect based on matching exposed to unexposed time periods for the same outcome unit, and we show that the bias of the resulting estimators is bounded. We illustrate our approach with an extensive simulation study and an application on the effect of wildfire smoke on transportation by bicycle.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximating Unrelated Machine Weighted Completion Time Using Iterative Rounding and Computer Assisted Proofs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04773v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the unrelated machine scheduling problem with the weighted completion time objective. It is known that independent rounding achieves a 1.5 approximation for the problem, and many prior algorithms improve upon this ratio by leveraging strong negative correlation schemes. On each machine $i$, these schemes introduce strong negative correlation between events that some pairs of jobs are assigned to $i$, while maintaining non-positive correlation for all pairs. Our algorithm deviates from this methodology by relaxing the pairwise non-positive correlation requirement. On each machine $i$, we identify many groups of jobs. For a job $j$ and a group $B$ not containing $j$, we only enforce non-positive correlation between $j$ and the group as a whole, allowing $j$ to be positively-correlated with individual jobs in $B$. This relaxation suffices to maintain the 1.5-approximation, while enabling us to obtain a much stronger negative correlation within groups using an iterative rounding procedure: at most one job from each group is scheduled on $i$. We prove that the algorithm achieves a $(1.36 + \epsilon)$-approximation, improving upon the previous best approximation ratio of $1.4$ due to Harris. While the improvement may not be substantial, the significance of our contribution lies in the relaxed non-positive correlation condition and the iterative rounding framework. Due to the simplicity of our algorithm, we are able to derive a closed form for the weighted completion time our algorithm achieves with a clean analysis. Unfortunately, we could not provide a good analytical analysis for the quantity; instead, we rely on a computer assisted proof.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aleph Filter: To Infinity in Constant Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04703v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filter data structures are widely used in various areas of computer science to answer approximate set-membership queries. In many applications, the data grows dynamically, requiring their filters to expand along with the data that they represent. However, existing methods for expanding filters cannot maintain stable performance, memory footprint, and false positive rate at the same time. We address this problem with Aleph Filter, which makes the following contributions. (1) It supports all operations (insertions, queries, deletes, etc.) in constant time, no matter how much the data grows. (2) Given any rough estimate of how much the data will ultimately grow, Aleph Filter provides far superior memory vs. false positive rate trade-offs, even if the estimate is off by orders of magnitude.</p></details> |  |

However, working together through synchronous editing of notebooks introduces new challenges. Data scientists may inadvertently interfere with each others' work by altering the shared codebase and runtime state if they do not set up a social protocol for working together and monitoring their collaborators' progress. In this paper, we propose a real-time collaborative editing model for resolving conflict edits in computational notebooks that introduces three levels of edit protection to help collaborators avoid introducing errors to both the program source code and changes to the runtime state.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs): Fast Pre-trained Models for Enhanced Zero/Few-Shot Forecasting of Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03955v4)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large pre-trained models for zero/few-shot learning excel in language and vision domains but encounter challenges in multivariate time series (TS) due to the diverse nature and scarcity of publicly available pre-training data. Consequently, there has been a recent surge in utilizing pre-trained large language models (LLMs) with token adaptations for TS forecasting. These approaches employ cross-domain transfer learning and surprisingly yield impressive results. However, these models are typically very slow and large (~billion parameters) and do not consider cross-channel correlations. To address this, we present Tiny Time Mixers (TTM), a significantly small model based on the lightweight TSMixer architecture. TTM marks the first success in developing fast and tiny general pre-trained models (<1M parameters), exclusively trained on public TS datasets, with effective transfer learning capabilities for forecasting. To tackle the complexity of pre-training on multiple datasets with varied temporal resolutions, we introduce several novel enhancements such as adaptive patching, dataset augmentation via downsampling, and resolution prefix tuning. Moreover, we employ a multi-level modeling strategy to effectively model channel correlations and infuse exogenous signals during fine-tuning, a crucial capability lacking in existing benchmarks. TTM shows significant accuracy gains (12-38\%) over popular benchmarks in few/zero-shot forecasting. It also drastically reduces the compute needs as compared to LLM-TS methods, with a 14X cut in learnable parameters, 106X less total parameters, and substantial reductions in fine-tuning (65X) and inference time (54X). In fact, TTM's zero-shot often surpasses the few-shot results in many popular benchmarks, highlighting the efficacy of our approach. Code and pre-trained models will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

While previous works focused on co-speech gesture or expression generation individually, the joint generation of synchronized expressions and gestures remains barely explored. To address this, our diffusion-based co-speech motion generation transformer enables uni-directional information flow from expression to gesture, facilitating improved matching of joint expression-gesture distributions. Furthermore, we introduce an outpainting-based sampling strategy for arbitrary long sequence generation in diffusion models, offering flexibility and computational efficiency. Our method provides a practical solution that produces high-quality synchronized expression and gesture generation driven by speech. Evaluated on two public datasets, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance both quantitatively and qualitatively. Additionally, a user study confirms the superiority of DiffSHEG over prior approaches. By enabling the real-time generation of expressive and synchronized motions, DiffSHEG showcases its potential for various applications in the development of digital humans and embodied agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024.

| **[A Two Time-Scale Joint Optimization Approach for UAV-assisted MEC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04597v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide aerial-terrestrial computing services close to mobile devices (MDs). However, meeting the demands of computation-intensive and delay-sensitive tasks for MDs poses several challenges, including the demand-supply contradiction between MDs and MEC servers, the demand-supply heterogeneity between MDs and MEC servers, the trajectory control requirements on energy efficiency and timeliness, and the different time-scale dynamics of the network. To address these issues, we first present a hierarchical architecture by incorporating terrestrial-aerial computing capabilities and leveraging UAV flexibility. Furthermore, we formulate a joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control problem to maximize the system utility. Since the problem is a non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose a two time-scale joint computing resource allocation, computation offloading, and trajectory control (TJCCT) approach. In the short time scale, we propose a price-incentive method for on-demand computing resource allocation and a matching mechanism-based method for computation offloading. In the long time scale, we propose a convex optimization-based method for UAV trajectory control. Besides, we prove the stability, optimality, and polynomial complexity of TJCCT. Simulation results demonstrate that TJCCT outperforms the comparative algorithms in terms of the utility of the system, the QoE of MDs, and the revenue of MEC servers.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2403.15828</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Time-step Curriculum for One Image to 3D Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04562v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Score distillation sampling~(SDS) has been widely adopted to overcome the absence of unseen views in reconstructing 3D objects from a \textbf{single} image. It leverages pre-trained 2D diffusion models as teacher to guide the reconstruction of student 3D models. Despite their remarkable success, SDS-based methods often encounter geometric artifacts and texture saturation. We find out the crux is the overlooked indiscriminate treatment of diffusion time-steps during optimization: it unreasonably treats the student-teacher knowledge distillation to be equal at all time-steps and thus entangles coarse-grained and fine-grained modeling. Therefore, we propose the Diffusion Time-step Curriculum one-image-to-3D pipeline (DTC123), which involves both the teacher and student models collaborating with the time-step curriculum in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on NeRF4, RealFusion15, GSO and Level50 benchmark demonstrate that DTC123 can produce multi-view consistent, high-quality, and diverse 3D assets. Codes and more generation demos will be released in https://github.com/yxymessi/DTC123.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Identity Testing of Noncommutative Rational Formulas in Deterministic Quasipolynomial Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15647v3)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rational Identity Testing (RIT) is the decision problem of determining whether or not a noncommutative rational formula computes zero in the free skew field. It admits a deterministic polynomial-time white-box algorithm [Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Wigderson (2016); Ivanyos, Qiao, Subrahmanyam (2018); Hamada and Hirai (2021)], and a randomized polynomial-time algorithm [Derksen and Makam (2017)] in the black-box setting, via singularity testing of linear matrices over the free skew field. Indeed, a randomized NC algorithm for RIT in the white-box setting follows from the result of Derksen and Makam (2017). Designing an efficient deterministic black-box algorithm for RIT and understanding the parallel complexity of RIT are major open problems in this area. Despite being open since the work of Garg, Gurvits, Oliveira, and Wigderson (2016), these questions have seen limited progress. In fact, the only known result in this direction is the construction of a quasipolynomial-size hitting set for rational formulas of only inversion height two [Arvind, Chatterjee, Mukhopadhyay (2022)]. In this paper, we significantly improve the black-box complexity of this problem and obtain the first quasipolynomial-size hitting set for all rational formulas of polynomial size. Our construction also yields the first deterministic quasi-NC upper bound for RIT in the white-box setting.</p></details> |  |

Our study data consists of GPS-based tracks of individual white-tailed deer (\textit{Odocoileus virginianus}) and three exotic Cervid species moving freely in a 172-ha high-fenced game preserve over given time periods. A serological test was performed on each individual to measure the antibody concentration of epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV) for each of three serotypes (EHDV-1, -2, and -6) at the beginning and at the end of each tracking period. EHDV is a vector-borne viral disease indirectly transmitted between ruminant hosts by biting midges (\textit{Culicoides} spp.). The purpose of this study is to estimate the spatial distribution of infection propensity by performing an epidemiological tomography of a region using tracers. We model the data as a binomial linear inverse problem, where spatial coherence is enforced with a total variation regularization. The smoothness of the reconstructed propensity map is selected by the quantile universal threshold, which can also test the null hypothesis that the propensity map is spatially constant. We apply our method to simulated and real data, showing good statistical properties during simulations and consistent results and interpretations compared to intensive field estimations.</p></details> |  |

The paper claims to provide a polynomial-time algorithm for solving the NP-complete problem 3-SAT. In examining the paper's argument, we find a flaw in one of the main sections of its algorithm.

| **[DeepLINK-T: deep learning inference for time series data using knockoffs and LSTM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04317v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional longitudinal time series data is prevalent across various real-world applications. Many such applications can be modeled as regression problems with high-dimensional time series covariates. Deep learning has been a popular and powerful tool for fitting these regression models. Yet, the development of interpretable and reproducible deep-learning models is challenging and remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel method, Deep Learning Inference using Knockoffs for Time series data (DeepLINK-T), focusing on the selection of significant time series variables in regression while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR) at a predetermined level. DeepLINK-T combines deep learning with knockoff inference to control FDR in feature selection for time series models, accommodating a wide variety of feature distributions. It addresses dependencies across time and features by leveraging a time-varying latent factor structure in time series covariates. Three key ingredients for DeepLINK-T are 1) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) autoencoder for generating time series knockoff variables, 2) an LSTM prediction network using both original and knockoff variables, and 3) the application of the knockoffs framework for variable selection with FDR control. Extensive simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate DeepLINK-T's performance, showing its capability to control FDR effectively while demonstrating superior feature selection power for high-dimensional longitudinal time series data compared to its non-time series counterpart. DeepLINK-T is further applied to three metagenomic data sets, validating its practical utility and effectiveness, and underscoring its potential in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

We prove that our semantics is bisimilar to the "standard" semantics of PITPNs. This allows us to use the rewriting logic tool Maude, combined with SMT solving, to provide sound and complete formal analyses for PITPNs. We develop and implement a new general folding approach for symbolic reachability, so that Maude-with-SMT reachability analysis terminates whenever the parametric state-class graph of the PITPN is finite. Our work opens up the possibility of using the many formal analysis capabilities of Maude -- including full LTL model checking, analysis with user-defined analysis strategies, and even statistical model checking -- for such nets. We illustrate this by explaining how almost all formal analysis and parameter synthesis methods supported by the state-of-the-art PITPN tool Romeo can be performed using Maude with SMT. In addition, we also support analysis and parameter synthesis from parametric initial markings, as well as full LTL model checking and analysis with user-defined execution strategies. Experiments show that our methods outperform Romeo in many cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2303.08929</p></details> |

This work presents a centralized network control algorithm executable on already existing quantum computer which are based on the principle of quantum annealing like the D-Wave Advantage. We introduce a resource reoccupation algorithm for traffic engineering in wide-area networks. The proposed optimization algorithm changes traffic steering and resource allocation in case of overloaded transceivers. Settings of active components like fiber amplifiers and transceivers are not changed for the reason of stability. This algorithm is beneficial in situations when the network traffic is fluctuating in time scales of seconds or spontaneous bursts occur. Further, we developed a discrete-time flow simulator to study the algorithm's performance in wide-area networks. Our network simulator considers backlog and loss modeling of buffered transmission lines. Concurring flows are handled equally in case of a backlog. This work provides an ILP-based network configuring algorithm that is applicable on quantum annealing computers. We showcase, that traffic losses can be reduced significantly by a factor of 2 if a resource reoccupation algorithm is applied in a network with bursty traffic. As resources are used more efficiently by reoccupation in heavy load situations, overprovisioning of networks can be reduced. Thus, this new form of network operation leads toward a zero-margin network. We show that our newly introduced network simulator enables analyses of short-time effects like buffering within fat-pipe networks. As the calculation of network configurations in real-sized networks is typically time-consuming, quantum computing can enable the proposed network configuration algorithm for application in real-sized wide-area networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 9 figures, submitted to "IEEE International Conference on High Performance Switching and Routing 2024"</p></details> |
| **[Continuous-time mediation analysis for repeatedly measured mediators and outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11017v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mediation analysis aims to decipher the underlying causal mechanisms between an exposure, an outcome, and intermediate variables called mediators. Initially developed for fixed-time mediator and outcome, it has been extended to the framework of longitudinal data by discretizing the assessment times of mediator and outcome. Yet, processes in play in longitudinal studies are usually defined in continuous time and measured at irregular and subject-specific visits. This is the case in dementia research when cerebral and cognitive changes measured at planned visits in cohorts are of interest. We thus propose a methodology to estimate the causal mechanisms between a time-fixed exposure ($X$), a mediator process ($\mathcal{M}_t$) and an outcome process ($\mathcal{Y}_t$) both measured repeatedly over time in the presence of a time-dependent confounding process ($\mathcal{L}_t$). We consider three types of causal estimands, the natural effects, path-specific effects and randomized interventional analogues to natural effects, and provide identifiability assumptions. We employ a dynamic multivariate model based on differential equations for their estimation. The performance of the methods are explored in simulations, and we illustrate the method in two real-world examples motivated by the 3C cerebral aging study to assess: (1) the effect of educational level on functional dependency through depressive symptomatology and cognitive functioning, and (2) the effect of a genetic factor on cognitive functioning potentially mediated by vascular brain lesions and confounded by neurodegeneration.</p></details> |  |

Current 3D few-shot segmentation methods first pre-train models on 'seen' classes, and then evaluate their generalization performance on 'unseen' classes. However, the prior pre-training stage not only introduces excessive time overhead but also incurs a significant domain gap on 'unseen' classes. To tackle these issues, we propose a Non-parametric Network for few-shot 3D Segmentation, Seg-NN, and its Parametric variant, Seg-PN. Without training, Seg-NN extracts dense representations by hand-crafted filters and achieves comparable performance to existing parametric models. Due to the elimination of pre-training, Seg-NN can alleviate the domain gap issue and save a substantial amount of time. Based on Seg-NN, Seg-PN only requires training a lightweight QUEry-Support Transferring (QUEST) module, which enhances the interaction between the support set and query set. Experiments suggest that Seg-PN outperforms previous state-of-the-art method by +4.19% and +7.71% mIoU on S3DIS and ScanNet datasets respectively, while reducing training time by -90%, indicating its effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR Highlight.

| **[Backward Reachability Analysis of Perturbed Continuous-Time Linear Systems Using Set Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19083v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backward reachability analysis computes the set of states that reach a target set under the competing influence of control input and disturbances. Depending on their interplay, the backward reachable set either represents all states that can be steered into the target set or all states that cannot avoid entering it -- the corresponding solutions can be used for controller synthesis and safety verification, respectively. A popular technique for backward reachable set computation solves Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equations, which scales exponentially with the state dimension due to gridding the state space. In this work, we instead use set propagation techniques to design backward reachability algorithms for linear time-invariant systems. Crucially, the proposed algorithms scale only polynomially with the state dimension. Our numerical examples demonstrate the tightness of the obtained backward reachable sets and show an overwhelming improvement of our proposed algorithms over state-of-the-art methods regarding scalability, as systems with well over a hundred states can now be analyzed.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Minor Containment and Disjoint Paths in almost-linear time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03958v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give an algorithm that, given graphs $G$ and $H$, tests whether $H$ is a minor of $G$ in time ${\cal O}_H(n^{1+o(1)})$; here, $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$ and the ${\cal O}_H(\cdot)$-notation hides factors that depend on $H$ and are computable. By the Graph Minor Theorem, this implies the existence of an $n^{1+o(1)}$-time membership test for every minor-closed class of graphs. More generally, we give an ${\cal O}_{H,|X|}(m^{1+o(1)})$-time algorithm for the rooted version of the problem, in which $G$ comes with a set of roots $X\subseteq V(G)$ and some of the branch sets of the sought minor model of $H$ are required to contain prescribed subsets of $X$; here, $m$ is the total number of vertices and edges of $G$. This captures the Disjoint Paths problem, for which we obtain an ${\cal O}_{k}(m^{1+o(1)})$-time algorithm, where $k$ is the number of terminal pairs. For all the mentioned problems, the fastest algorithms known before are due to Kawarabayashi, Kobayashi, and Reed [JCTB 2012], and have a time complexity that is quadratic in the number of vertices of $G$. Our algorithm has two main ingredients: First, we show that by using the dynamic treewidth data structure of Korhonen, Majewski, Nadara, Pilipczuk, and Soko{\l}owski [FOCS 2023], the irrelevant vertex technique of Robertson and Seymour can be implemented in almost-linear time on apex-minor-free graphs. Then, we apply the recent advances in almost-linear time flow/cut algorithms to give an almost-linear time implementation of the recursive understanding technique, which effectively reduces the problem to apex-minor-free graphs.</p></details> | 81 pages |

Long term missions, such as NASA's Landsat, Terra, and Aqua satellites, and more recently, the ESA's Sentinel missions, record images of the entire world every few days. Although single images provide point-in-time data, repeated images of the same area, or satellite image time series (SITS) provide information about the changing state of vegetation and land use. These SITS are useful for modeling dynamic processes and seasonal changes such as plant phenology. They have potential benefits for many aspects of land and natural resource management, including applications in agricultural, forest, water, and disaster management, urban planning, and mining. However, the resulting satellite image time series (SITS) are complex, incorporating information from the temporal, spatial, and spectral dimensions. Therefore, deep learning methods are often deployed as they can analyze these complex relationships. This review presents a summary of the state-of-the-art methods of modelling environmental, agricultural, and other Earth observation variables from SITS data using deep learning methods. We aim to provide a resource for remote sensing experts interested in using deep learning techniques to enhance Earth observation models with temporal information.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

We propose a new system realization approach that uses an "information-state" as the state vector, where the "information-state" is composed of a finite number of past inputs and outputs. The system identification algorithm uses input-output data to fit an autoregressive moving average model (ARMA) to represent the current output in terms of finite past inputs and outputs. This information-state-based approach allows us to directly realize a state-space model using the estimated time varying ARMA paramters linear time varying (LTV) systems. The paper develops the theoretical foundation for using ARMA parameters-based system representation using only the concept of linear observability, details the reasoning for exact output modeling using only the finite history, and shows that there is no need to separate the free and the forced response for identification. The paper also discusses the implications of using the information-state system for optimal output feedback control and shows that the solution obtained using a suitably posed information state problem is optimal for the original problem. The proposed approach is tested on various different systems, and the performance is compared with state-of-the-art LTV system identification techniques.</p></details> |  |

| **[PrivShape: Extracting Shapes in Time Series under User-Level Local Differential Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03873v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series have numerous applications in finance, healthcare, IoT, and smart city. In many of these applications, time series typically contain personal data, so privacy infringement may occur if they are released directly to the public. Recently, local differential privacy (LDP) has emerged as the state-of-the-art approach to protecting data privacy. However, existing works on LDP-based collections cannot preserve the shape of time series. A recent work, PatternLDP, attempts to address this problem, but it can only protect a finite group of elements in a time series due to {\omega}-event level privacy guarantee. In this paper, we propose PrivShape, a trie-based mechanism under user-level LDP to protect all elements. PrivShape first transforms a time series to reduce its length, and then adopts trie-expansion and two-level refinement to improve utility. By extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that PrivShape outperforms PatternLDP when adapted for offline use, and can effectively extract frequent shapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Evaluation of Real-time Adaptive Sampling Change Point Detection Algorithm using KCUSUM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10291v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting abrupt changes in real-time data streams from scientific simulations presents a challenging task, demanding the deployment of accurate and efficient algorithms. Identifying change points in live data stream involves continuous scrutiny of incoming observations for deviations in their statistical characteristics, particularly in high-volume data scenarios. Maintaining a balance between sudden change detection and minimizing false alarms is vital. Many existing algorithms for this purpose rely on known probability distributions, limiting their feasibility. In this study, we introduce the Kernel-based Cumulative Sum (KCUSUM) algorithm, a non-parametric extension of the traditional Cumulative Sum (CUSUM) method, which has gained prominence for its efficacy in online change point detection under less restrictive conditions. KCUSUM splits itself by comparing incoming samples directly with reference samples and computes a statistic grounded in the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) non-parametric framework. This approach extends KCUSUM's pertinence to scenarios where only reference samples are available, such as atomic trajectories of proteins in vacuum, facilitating the detection of deviations from the reference sample without prior knowledge of the data's underlying distribution. Furthermore, by harnessing MMD's inherent random-walk structure, we can theoretically analyze KCUSUM's performance across various use cases, including metrics like expected delay and mean runtime to false alarms. Finally, we discuss real-world use cases from scientific simulations such as NWChem CODAR and protein folding data, demonstrating KCUSUM's practical effectiveness in online change point detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1903.01661</p></details> |

Diagnosing and Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Event Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14970v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event temporal reasoning aims at identifying the temporal relations between two or more events from narratives. However, knowledge conflicts arise when there is a mismatch between the actual temporal relations of events in the context and the prior knowledge or biases learned by the model. In this paper, we propose to detect knowledge-conflict examples in event temporal reasoning using bias indicators, which include event relation prior bias, tense bias, narrative bias, and dependency bias. We define conflict examples as those where event relations are opposite to biased or prior relations. To mitigate event-related knowledge conflicts, we introduce a Counterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA) based method that can be applied to both Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) either as additional training data or demonstrations for In-Context Learning. Experiments suggest both PLMs and LLMs suffer from knowledge conflicts in event temporal reasoning, and CDA has the potential for reducing hallucination and improving model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of NAACL 2024</p></details> |

Specifically, we consider a generic objective function that is defined for the path of each individual agent. The primary objective is to find a global plan for the team of agents, ensuring they collectively meet the specified LTL requirements. Simultaneously, we aim to maintain a pre-determined order in the values of the objective function for each agent, which we refer to as the ordering constraints. This new requirement stems from scenarios like security-aware planning, where relative orders outweigh absolute values in importance. We present an efficient algorithm to solve this problem, supported by proofs of correctness that demonstrate the optimality of our solution. Additionally, we provide a case study in security-aware path planning to illustrate the practicality and effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article is withdrawn due to errors in the methodology section, specifically concerning the insufficient explanation of the data collection process.

| **[Fully Automated Verification of Linear Time-Invariant Systems against Signal Temporal Logic Specifications via Reachability Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04089v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reachability analysis is one of the most promising approaches for formal verification of dynamic systems, a major disadvantage preventing a more widespread application is the requirement to manually tune algorithm parameters such as the time step size. Manual tuning is especially problematic if one aims to verify that the system satisfies complicated specifications described by signal temporal logic formulas since the effect the tightness of the reachable set has on the satisfaction of the specification is often non-trivial to see for humans. We address this problem with a fully-automated verifier for linear systems, which automatically refines all parameters for reachability analysis until it can either prove or disprove that the system satisfies a signal temporal logic formula for all initial states and all uncertain inputs. Our verifier combines reachset temporal logic with dependency preservation to obtain a model checking approach whose over-approximation error converges to zero for adequately tuned parameters. While we in this work focus on linear systems for simplicity, the general concept we present can equivalently be applied for nonlinear and hybrid systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-Time Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05426v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Shot Temporal Action Localization (ZS-TAL) seeks to identify and locate actions in untrimmed videos unseen during training. Existing ZS-TAL methods involve fine-tuning a model on a large amount of annotated training data. While effective, training-based ZS-TAL approaches assume the availability of labeled data for supervised learning, which can be impractical in some applications. Furthermore, the training process naturally induces a domain bias into the learned model, which may adversely affect the model's generalization ability to arbitrary videos. These considerations prompt us to approach the ZS-TAL problem from a radically novel perspective, relaxing the requirement for training data. To this aim, we introduce a novel method that performs Test-Time adaptation for Temporal Action Localization (T3AL). In a nutshell, T3AL adapts a pre-trained Vision and Language Model (VLM). T3AL operates in three steps. First, a video-level pseudo-label of the action category is computed by aggregating information from the entire video. Then, action localization is performed adopting a novel procedure inspired by self-supervised learning. Finally, frame-level textual descriptions extracted with a state-of-the-art captioning model are employed for refining the action region proposals. We validate the effectiveness of T3AL by conducting experiments on the THUMOS14 and the ActivityNet-v1.3 datasets. Our results demonstrate that T3AL significantly outperforms zero-shot baselines based on state-of-the-art VLMs, confirming the benefit of a test-time adaptation approach.</p></details> |  |

T-DEED addresses multiple challenges in the task, including the need for discriminability among frame representations, high output temporal resolution to maintain prediction precision, and the necessity to capture information at different temporal scales to handle events with varying dynamics. It tackles these challenges through its specifically designed architecture, featuring an encoder-decoder for leveraging multiple temporal scales and achieving high output temporal resolution, along with temporal modules designed to increase token discriminability. Leveraging these characteristics, T-DEED achieves SOTA performance on the FigureSkating and FineDiving datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Network-Constrained Unit Commitment with Flexible Temporal Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05217v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern network-constrained unit commitment (NCUC) bears a heavy computational burden due to the ever-growing model scale. This situation becomes more challenging when detailed operational characteristics, complicated constraints, and multiple objectives are considered. We propose a novel simplification method to determine the flexible temporal resolution for acceleration and near-optimal solutions. The flexible temporal resolution is determined by analyzing the impact on generators in each adaptive time period with awareness of congestion effects. Additionally, multiple improvements are employed on the existing NCUC model compatible with flexible temporal resolution to reduce the number of integer variables while preserving the original features. A case study using the IEEE 118-bus and the Polish 2736-bus systems verifies that the proposed method achieves substantial acceleration with low cost variation and high accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Spatio-Temporal Attention and Gaussian Processes for Personalized Video Gaze Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05215v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaze is an essential prompt for analyzing human behavior and attention. Recently, there has been an increasing interest in determining gaze direction from facial videos. However, video gaze estimation faces significant challenges, such as understanding the dynamic evolution of gaze in video sequences, dealing with static backgrounds, and adapting to variations in illumination. To address these challenges, we propose a simple and novel deep learning model designed to estimate gaze from videos, incorporating a specialized attention module. Our method employs a spatial attention mechanism that tracks spatial dynamics within videos. This technique enables accurate gaze direction prediction through a temporal sequence model, adeptly transforming spatial observations into temporal insights, thereby significantly improving gaze estimation accuracy. Additionally, our approach integrates Gaussian processes to include individual-specific traits, facilitating the personalization of our model with just a few labeled samples. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of the proposed approach, demonstrating its success in both within-dataset and cross-dataset settings. Specifically, our proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Gaze360 dataset, improving by $2.5^\circ$ without personalization. Further, by personalizing the model with just three samples, we achieved an additional improvement of $0.8^\circ$.

By encoding a temporal consistency prior into a Gromov-Wasserstein problem, we are able to decode a temporally consistent segmentation from a noisy affinity/matching cost matrix between video frames and action classes. Unlike previous approaches, our method does not require knowing the action order for a video to attain temporal consistency. Furthermore, our resulting (fused) Gromov-Wasserstein problem can be efficiently solved on GPUs using a few iterations of projected mirror descent. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in an unsupervised learning setting, where our method is used to generate pseudo-labels for self-training. We evaluate our segmentation approach and unsupervised learning pipeline on the Breakfast, 50-Salads, YouTube Instructions and Desktop Assembly datasets, yielding state-of-the-art results for the unsupervised video action segmentation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[Spatio-Temporal Turbulence Mitigation: A Translational Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04244v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering images distorted by atmospheric turbulence is a challenging inverse problem due to the stochastic nature of turbulence. Although numerous turbulence mitigation (TM) algorithms have been proposed, their efficiency and generalization to real-world dynamic scenarios remain severely limited. Building upon the intuitions of classical TM algorithms, we present the Deep Atmospheric TUrbulence Mitigation network (DATUM). DATUM aims to overcome major challenges when transitioning from classical to deep learning approaches. By carefully integrating the merits of classical multi-frame TM methods into a deep network structure, we demonstrate that DATUM can efficiently perform long-range temporal aggregation using a recurrent fashion, while deformable attention and temporal-channel attention seamlessly facilitate pixel registration and lucky imaging. With additional supervision, tilt and blur degradation can be jointly mitigated. These inductive biases empower DATUM to significantly outperform existing methods while delivering a tenfold increase in processing speed. A large-scale training dataset, ATSyn, is presented as a co-invention to enable generalization in real turbulence.

| **[MANTRA: Temporal Betweenness Centrality Approximation through Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08356v4)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MANTRA, a framework for approximating the temporal betweenness centrality of all nodes in a temporal graph. Our method can compute probabilistically guaranteed high-quality temporal betweenness estimates (of nodes and temporal edges) under all the feasible temporal path optimalities, presented in the work of Bu{\ss} et al. (KDD, 2020). We provide a sample-complexity analysis of our method and speed up the temporal betweenness computation using a state-of-the-art progressive sampling approach based on Monte Carlo Empirical Rademacher Averages. Additionally, we provide an efficient sampling algorithm to approximate the temporal diameter, average path length, and other fundamental temporal graph characteristic quantities within a small error $\varepsilon$ with high probability. The running time of such approximation algorithm is $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\frac{\log n}{\varepsilon^2}\cdot |\mathcal{E}|)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $|\mathcal{E}|$ is the number of temporal edges in the temporal graph. We support our theoretical results with an extensive experimental analysis on several real-world networks and provide empirical evidence that the MANTRA framework improves the current state of the art in speed, sample size, and required space while maintaining high accuracy of the temporal betweenness estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Generalization Estimation in Evolving Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04969v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely deployed in vast fields, but they often struggle to maintain accurate representations as graphs evolve. We theoretically establish a lower bound, proving that under mild conditions, representation distortion inevitably occurs over time. To estimate the temporal distortion without human annotation after deployment, one naive approach is to pre-train a recurrent model (e.g., RNN) before deployment and use this model afterwards, but the estimation is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we analyze the representation distortion from an information theory perspective, and attribute it primarily to inaccurate feature extraction during evolution. Consequently, we introduce Smart, a straightforward and effective baseline enhanced by an adaptive feature extractor through self-supervised graph reconstruction. In synthetic random graphs, we further refine the former lower bound to show the inevitable distortion over time and empirically observe that Smart achieves good estimation performance. Moreover, we observe that Smart consistently shows outstanding generalization estimation on four real-world evolving graphs. The ablation studies underscore the necessity of graph reconstruction. For example, on OGB-arXiv dataset, the estimation metric MAPE deteriorates from 2.19% to 8.00% without reconstruction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Video Anomaly Detection via Spatio-Temporal Pseudo-Anomaly Generation : A Unified Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16514v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) is an open-set recognition task, which is usually formulated as a one-class classification (OCC) problem, where training data is comprised of videos with normal instances while test data contains both normal and anomalous instances. Recent works have investigated the creation of pseudo-anomalies (PAs) using only the normal data and making strong assumptions about real-world anomalies with regards to abnormality of objects and speed of motion to inject prior information about anomalies in an autoencoder (AE) based reconstruction model during training. This work proposes a novel method for generating generic spatio-temporal PAs by inpainting a masked out region of an image using a pre-trained Latent Diffusion Model and further perturbing the optical flow using mixup to emulate spatio-temporal distortions in the data. In addition, we present a simple unified framework to detect real-world anomalies under the OCC setting by learning three types of anomaly indicators, namely reconstruction quality, temporal irregularity and semantic inconsistency. Extensive experiments on four VAD benchmark datasets namely Ped2, Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal demonstrate that our method performs on par with other existing state-of-the-art PAs generation and reconstruction based methods under the OCC setting. Our analysis also examines the transferability and generalisation of PAs across these datasets, offering valuable insights by identifying real-world anomalies through PAs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in CVPRW 2024 - VAND Workshop</p></details> |
| **[UniMD: Towards Unifying Moment Retrieval and Temporal Action Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04933v1)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Action Detection (TAD) focuses on detecting pre-defined actions, while Moment Retrieval (MR) aims to identify the events described by open-ended natural language within untrimmed videos. Despite that they focus on different events, we observe they have a significant connection. For instance, most descriptions in MR involve multiple actions from TAD. In this paper, we aim to investigate the potential synergy between TAD and MR. Firstly, we propose a unified architecture, termed Unified Moment Detection (UniMD), for both TAD and MR. It transforms the inputs of the two tasks, namely actions for TAD or events for MR, into a common embedding space, and utilizes two novel query-dependent decoders to generate a uniform output of classification score and temporal segments. Secondly, we explore the efficacy of two task fusion learning approaches, pre-training and co-training, in order to enhance the mutual benefits between TAD and MR. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed task fusion learning scheme enables the two tasks to help each other and outperform the separately trained counterparts. Impressively, UniMD achieves state-of-the-art results on three paired datasets Ego4D, Charades-STA, and ActivityNet. Our code will be released at https://github.com/yingsen1/UniMD.</p></details> | Tech report |
| **[StepNet: Spatial-temporal Part-aware Network for Isolated Sign Language Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.12857v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of sign language recognition (SLR) is to help those who are hard of hearing or deaf overcome the communication barrier. Most existing approaches can be typically divided into two lines, i.e., Skeleton-based and RGB-based methods, but both the two lines of methods have their limitations. Skeleton-based methods do not consider facial expressions, while RGB-based approaches usually ignore the fine-grained hand structure. To overcome both limitations, we propose a new framework called Spatial-temporal Part-aware network~(StepNet), based on RGB parts. As its name suggests, it is made up of two modules: Part-level Spatial Modeling and Part-level Temporal Modeling. Part-level Spatial Modeling, in particular, automatically captures the appearance-based properties, such as hands and faces, in the feature space without the use of any keypoint-level annotations. On the other hand, Part-level Temporal Modeling implicitly mines the long-short term context to capture the relevant attributes over time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our StepNet, thanks to spatial-temporal modules, achieves competitive Top-1 Per-instance accuracy on three commonly-used SLR benchmarks, i.e., 56.89% on WLASL, 77.2% on NMFs-CSL, and 77.1% on BOBSL. Additionally, the proposed method is compatible with the optical flow input and can produce superior performance if fused. For those who are hard of hearing, we hope that our work can act as a preliminary step.</p></details> |  |

The resulting temporal-aware clusters are then utilized to compute the final summary, using simple rules for keyframe selection and frame importance scoring. Experimental results on the SumMe dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, outperforming existing unsupervised methods and achieving comparable performance to state-of-the-art supervised summarization techniques.

Our approach utilizes a transformer architecture with heterogeneous type embedding trained using temporal-difference learning. After obtaining an initial estimate using the transformer, following the targeted minimum loss-based likelihood estimation (TMLE) framework, we statistically corrected for the bias commonly associated with machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, our method also facilitates statistical inference by enabling the provision of 95% confidence intervals grounded in asymptotic statistical theory. Simulation results demonstrate our method's superior performance over existing approaches, particularly in complex, long time-horizon scenarios. It remains effective in small-sample, short-duration contexts, matching the performance of asymptotically efficient estimators. To demonstrate our method in practice, we applied our method to estimate counterfactual mean outcomes for standard versus intensive blood pressure management strategies in a real-world cardiovascular epidemiology cohort study.</p></details> |  |

Towards both ends, we introduce the temporal counting logic $\textbf{K}_\text{t}$[#] alongside the RASP variant $\textbf{C-RASP}$. We show they are equivalent to each other, and that together they are the best-known lower bound on the formal expressivity of future-masked soft attention transformers with unbounded input size. We prove this by showing all $\textbf{K}_\text{t}$[#] formulas can be compiled into these transformers. As a case study, we demonstrate on paper how to use $\textbf{C-RASP}$ to construct simple transformer language models that, using greedy decoding, can only generate sentences that have given properties formally specified in $\textbf{K}_\text{t}$[#].</p></details> |  |

These scenarios, despite realistic, are often neglected in the literature, exposing these solutions to important performance degradation. In this work, we tackle this issue by introducing, for the first time, an approach for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) in sparse TAL, which we refer to as Semantic Adversarial unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SADA). Our contributions are threefold: (1) we pioneer the development of a domain adaptation model that operates on realistic sparse action detection benchmarks; (2) we tackle the limitations of global-distribution alignment techniques by introducing a novel adversarial loss that is sensitive to local class distributions, ensuring finer-grained adaptation; and (3) we present a novel set of benchmarks based on EpicKitchens100 and CharadesEgo, that evaluate multiple domain shifts in a comprehensive manner. Our experiments indicate that SADA improves the adaptation across domains when compared to fully supervised state-of-the-art and alternative UDA methods, attaining a performance boost of up to 6.14% mAP.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches struggle to establish effective symbolic reasoning structures, which are crucial for answering compositional spatio-temporal questions. To address this challenge, we propose a neural-symbolic framework called Neural-Symbolic VideoQA (NS-VideoQA), specifically designed for real-world VideoQA tasks. The uniqueness and superiority of NS-VideoQA are two-fold: 1) It proposes a Scene Parser Network (SPN) to transform static-dynamic video scenes into Symbolic Representation (SR), structuralizing persons, objects, relations, and action chronologies. 2) A Symbolic Reasoning Machine (SRM) is designed for top-down question decompositions and bottom-up compositional reasonings. Specifically, a polymorphic program executor is constructed for internally consistent reasoning from SR to the final answer. As a result, Our NS-VideoQA not only improves the compositional spatio-temporal reasoning in real-world VideoQA task, but also enables step-by-step error analysis by tracing the intermediate results. Experimental evaluations on the AGQA Decomp benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed NS-VideoQA framework. Empirical studies further confirm that NS-VideoQA exhibits internal consistency in answering compositional questions and significantly improves the capability of spatio-temporal and logical inference for VideoQA tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, unravelling the underlying reasoning of LLMs and explaining their internal mechanisms of exploiting this factual knowledge remain active areas of investigation. Our work analyzes the factual knowledge encoded in the latent representation of LLMs when prompted to assess the truthfulness of factual claims. We propose an end-to-end framework that jointly decodes the factual knowledge embedded in the latent space of LLMs from a vector space to a set of ground predicates and represents its evolution across the layers using a temporal knowledge graph. Our framework relies on the technique of activation patching which intervenes in the inference computation of a model by dynamically altering its latent representations. Consequently, we neither rely on external models nor training processes. We showcase our framework with local and global interpretability analyses using two claim verification datasets: FEVER and CLIMATE-FEVER. The local interpretability analysis exposes different latent errors from representation to multi-hop reasoning errors. On the other hand, the global analysis uncovered patterns in the underlying evolution of the model's factual knowledge (e.g., store-and-seek factual information). By enabling graph-based analyses of the latent representations, this work represents a step towards the mechanistic interpretability of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

The Richards equation is used to describe unsaturated flow, while the advection-dispersion equation (ADE) is used for modeling solute transport. The standard finite element discretization in space is utilized and four time-stepping methods are studied. Three of these methods require an iterative resolution to solve the Richards equation in its mixed form. In the remaining method, a novel technique is proposed to linearize the system of equations in time, and the iterative processes are avoided. In this method, a free stabilized parameter is introduced. Numerical tests are conducted to analyze the accuracy and efficiency of methods. The developed linear scheme based on the optimal free parameter is accurate and performs better in terms of efficiency since it offers a considerable gain in computational time compared to the other methods. The reliability and effectiveness of the developed semi-implicit scheme are investigated using numerical experiments for modeling water flow and solute transport in unsaturated soils.</p></details> |  |

The evolution of 3D semantic occupancy prediction as a pretraining task for autonomous driving and robotic downstream tasks capture finer 3D details compared to methods like 3D detection. Existing approaches predominantly focus on spatial cues such as tri-perspective view embeddings (TPV), often overlooking temporal cues. This study introduces a spatiotemporal transformer architecture S2TPVFormer for temporally coherent 3D semantic occupancy prediction. We enrich the prior process by including temporal cues using a novel temporal cross-view hybrid attention mechanism (TCVHA) and generate spatiotemporal TPV embeddings (i.e. S2TPV embeddings). Experimental evaluations on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate a substantial 4.1% improvement in mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) for 3D Semantic Occupancy compared to TPVFormer, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed S2TPVFormer in enhancing 3D scene perception.</p></details> |  |

However, both architectures have their inherent shortcomings. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on spatial state models, has shown remarkable performance in a series of natural language processing tasks, which can effectively compensate for the shortcomings of the above two architectures. In this paper, we explore for the first time the potential of the Mamba architecture for remote sensing change detection tasks. We tailor the corresponding frameworks, called MambaBCD, MambaSCD, and MambaBDA, for binary change detection (BCD), semantic change detection (SCD), and building damage assessment (BDA), respectively. All three frameworks adopt the cutting-edge visual Mamba architecture as the encoder, which allows full learning of global spatial contextual information from the input images. For the change decoder, which is available in all three architectures, we propose three spatio-temporal relationship modeling mechanisms, which can be naturally combined with the Mamba architecture and fully utilize its attribute to achieve spatio-temporal interaction of multi-temporal features and obtain accurate change information. On five benchmark datasets, our proposed frameworks outperform current CNN- and Transformer-based approaches without using any complex strategies or tricks, fully demonstrating the potential of the Mamba architecture. Specifically, we obtained 83.11%, 88.39% and 94.19% F1 scores on the three BCD datasets SYSU, LEVIR-CD+, and WHU-CD; on the SCD dataset SECOND, we obtained 24.04% SeK; and on the xBD dataset, we obtained 81.41% overall F1 score.

On the other hand, search for multivariate copulas with desirable dependence properties also is an important area of research. When fitting regression models to non-Gaussian longitudinal data, multivariate Gaussian copula is commonly used to account for temporal dependence of the repeated measurements. But using symmetric multivariate Gaussian copula is not preferable in every situation, since it can not capture non-exchangeable dependence or tail dependence, if present in the data. Hence to ensure reliable inference, it is important to look beyond the Gaussian dependence assumption. In this paper, we construct geometric skew-normal copula from multivariate geometric skew-normal (MGSN) distribution proposed by Kundu (2014) and Kundu (2017) in order to model temporal dependency of non-Gaussian longitudinal data. First we investigate the theoretical properties of the proposed multivariate copula, and then develop regression models for both continuous and discrete longitudinal data. The quantile function of this copula is independent of the correlation matrix of its respective multivariate distribution, which provides computational advantage in terms of likelihood inference compared to the class of copulas derived from skew-elliptical distributions by Azzalini & Valle (1996). Moreover, composite likelihood inference is possible for this multivariate copula, which facilitates to estimate parameters from ordered probit model with same dependence structure as geometric skew-normal distribution. We conduct extensive simulation studies to validate our proposed models and therefore apply them to analyze the longitudinal dependence of two real world data sets. Finally, we report our findings in terms of improvements over multivariate Gaussian copula based regression models.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures and 5 tables</p></details> |

In this work, we develop a direct data-driven control synthesis method for temporal logic specifications, which does not require this explicit modeling step, capable of providing certificates for the general class of linear systems. After collecting a single sequence of input-output data from the system, we construct a data-driven characterization of the behavior. Using this characterization, we synthesize a controller, such that the controlled system satisfies a (possibly unbounded) temporal logic specification. The underlying optimization problem is solved by mixed-integer linear programming. We demonstrate the applicability of the results through simulation examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 8th IFAC conference on Analysis and Design of Hybrid Systems</p></details> |

In particular, we formally verify the LTL formula by constructing temporal logic trees (TLT)s via backward reachability analysis (BRA). In previous works, TLTs are predominantly constructed with either highly general and computationally intensive level set-based BRA or simplistic and computationally efficient polytope-based BRA. In this work, we instead propose the construction of TLTs using hybrid zonotope-based BRA. By using hybrid zonotopes, we show that we are able to formally verify LTL specifications in a computationally efficient manner while still being able to represent complex geometries that are often present when deploying autonomous systems, such as non-convex, disjoint sets. Moreover, we evaluate our approach on a parking example, providing preliminary indications of how hybrid zonotopes facilitate computationally efficient formal verification of LTL specifications in environments that naturally lead to non-convex, disjoint geometries.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm</p></details> |

CMT captures both heterogeneity and dynamics of HTG and generates high-quality representations for crowdsourcing fraud detection in a self-supervised manner. We deploy CMT to detect crowdsourcing frauds on an industry-size HTG of a representative MMMA WeChat and it significantly outperforms other methods.

Despite significant advancements towards an end-to-end framework in object detection, query-based detectors have been limited in achieving full end-to-end modeling in TAD. To address this issue, we propose \modelname{}, a full end-to-end temporal action detection transformer that integrates time-aligned coordinate expression. We reformulate coordinate expression utilizing actual timeline values, ensuring length-invariant representations from the extremely diverse video duration environment. Furthermore, our proposed adaptive query selection dynamically adjusts the number of queries based on video length, providing a suitable solution for varying video durations compared to a fixed query set. Our approach not only simplifies the TAD process by eliminating the need for hand-crafted components but also significantly improves the performance of query-based detectors. Our TE-TAD outperforms the previous query-based detectors and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on popular benchmark datasets.

While contrastive learning approach is promising in addressing spatio-temporal heterogeneity, the existing methods are noneffective in determining negative pairs and can hardly apply to PFL paradigm. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel PFL method, named Federated dUal sEmantic aLignment-based contraStive learning (FUELS), which can adaptively align positive and negative pairs based on semantic similarity, thereby injecting precise spatio-temporal heterogeneity into the latent representation space by auxiliary contrastive tasks. From temporal perspective, a hard negative filtering module is introduced to dynamically align heterogeneous temporal representations for the supplemented intra-client contrastive task. From spatial perspective, we design lightweight-but-efficient prototypes as client-level semantic representations, based on which the server evaluates spatial similarity and yields client-customized global prototypes for the supplemented inter-client contrastive task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FUELS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with communication cost decreasing by around 94%.</p></details> |  |

| **[Structure-reinforced Transformer for Dynamic Graph Representation Learning with Edge Temporal States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10079v2)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning field of dynamic graph representation learning, fuelled by the increasing demand for graph data analysis in real-world applications, poses both enticing opportunities and formidable challenges. Despite the promising results achieved by recent research leveraging recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), these approaches often fail to adequately consider the impact of the edge temporal states on the strength of inter-node relationships across different time slices, further overlooking the dynamic changes in node features induced by fluctuations in relationship strength. Furthermore, the extraction of global structural features is hindered by the inherent over-smoothing drawback of GNNs, which in turn limits their overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel dynamic graph representation learning framework namely Recurrent Structure-reinforced Graph Transformer (RSGT), which initially models the temporal status of edges explicitly by utilizing different edge types and weights based on the differences between any two consecutive snapshots. In this manner, the varying edge temporal states are mapped as a part of the topological structure of the graph. Subsequently, a structure-reinforced graph transformer is proposed to capture temporal node representations that encoding both the graph topological structure and evolving dynamics,through a recurrent learning paradigm. Our experimental evaluations, conducted on four real-world datasets, underscore the superior performance of the RSGT in the realm of discrete dynamic graph representation learning. The results reveal that RSGT consistently surpasses competing methods in dynamic link prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

In this paper, we propose self-attention GCN hybrid model, Multi-Scale Spatial-Temporal self-attention (MSST)-GCN to effectively improve modeling ability to achieve state-of-the-art results on several datasets. We utilize spatial self-attention module with adaptive topology to understand intra-frame interactions within a frame among different body parts, and temporal self-attention module to examine correlations between frames of a node. These two are followed by multi-scale convolution network with dilations, which not only captures the long-range temporal dependencies of joints but also the long-range spatial dependencies (i.e., long-distance dependencies) of node temporal behaviors. They are combined into high-level spatial-temporal representations and output the predicted action with the softmax classifier.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

Our key contribution is the development of user-level differentially private algorithms that incorporate carefully chosen parameter values to ensure low estimation errors on real-world datasets, while ensuring privacy. We test our algorithms on ITMS (Intelligent Traffic Management System) data from an Indian city, where the speeds of different buses are drawn in a potentially non-i.i.d. manner from an unknown distribution, and where the number of speed samples contributed by different buses is potentially different. We then apply our algorithms to large synthetic datasets, generated based on the ITMS data. Here, we provide theoretical justification for the observed performance trends, and also provide recommendations for the choices of algorithm subroutines that result in low estimation errors. Finally, we characterize the best performance of pseudo-user creation-based algorithms on worst-case datasets via a minimax approach; this then gives rise to a novel procedure for the creation of pseudo-users, which optimizes the worst-case total estimation error. The algorithms discussed in the paper are readily applicable to general spatio-temporal IoT datasets for releasing a differentially private mean of a desired value.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, to be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Most formulations of temporal complex event are unstructured or without extensive temporal information, resulting in inferior representations and limited forecasting capabilities. To bridge these gaps, we innovatively introduce the formulation of Structured, Complex, and Time-complete temporal event (SCTc-TE). Following this comprehensive formulation, we develop a fully automated pipeline and construct a large-scale dataset named MidEast-TE from about 0.6 million news articles. This dataset focuses on the cooperation and conflict events among countries mainly in the MidEast region from 2015 to 2022. Not limited to the dataset construction, more importantly, we advance the forecasting methods by discriminating the crucial roles of various contextual information, i.e., local and global contexts. Thereby, we propose a novel method LoGo that is able to take advantage of both Local and Global contexts for SCTc-TE forecasting. We evaluate our proposed approach on both our proposed MidEast-TE dataset and the original GDELT-TE dataset. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our forecasting model LoGo.

While bearing sensors are typically placed on the bearing housing, direct load monitoring requires sensors inside the bearing itself. Recently introduced sensor rollers enable direct bearing load monitoring but are constrained by their battery life. Data-driven virtual sensors can learn from sensor roller data collected during a batterys lifetime to map operating conditions to bearing loads. Although spatially distributed bearing sensors offer insights into load distribution (e.g., correlating temperature with load), traditional machine learning algorithms struggle to fully exploit these spatial-temporal dependencies. To address this gap, we introduce a graph-based virtual sensor that leverages Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to analyze spatial-temporal dependencies among sensor signals, mapping existing measurements (temperature, vibration) to bearing loads. Since temperature and vibration signals exhibit vastly different dynamics, we propose Heterogeneous Temporal Graph Neural Networks (HTGNN), which explicitly models these signal types and their interactions for effective load prediction. Our results demonstrate that HTGNN outperforms Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which struggle to capture both spatial and heterogeneous signal characteristics. These findings highlight the importance of capturing the complex spatial interactions between temperature, vibration, and load.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, networks encode only pairwise interactions, while most social interactions occur among groups of individuals, requiring higher-order network representations. Despite the recent interest in higher-order networks, little is known about the mechanisms that govern the formation and evolution of groups, and how people move between groups. Here, we leverage empirical data on social interactions among children and university students to study their temporal dynamics at both individual and group levels, characterising how individuals navigate groups and how groups form and disaggregate. We find robust patterns across contexts and propose a dynamical model that closely reproduces empirical observations. These results represent a further step in understanding social systems, and open up research directions to study the impact of group dynamics on dynamical processes that evolve on top of them.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, Supplementary Material (15 pages, 25 figures)</p></details> |

The main motivation for the model is to integrate the temporal dimension into the analysis of players' passing networks in order to gain deeper insights into the dynamics of system behavior, particularly how a system exploits the degeneracy property to self-regulate. First, the temporal graph model and the entropy measures used to assess the complexity of the dynamics of the network structure are introduced and illustrated. Second, an experiment using basketball data is conducted to investigate the relationship between the complexity level and team performance. This is accomplished by examining the correlations between the entropy measures in a team's behavior and the team's final performance, as well as the link between the relative score compared to that of the opponent and the entropy in the team's behavior. Results indicate positive correlations between entropy measures and final team performance, and threshold values of relative score associated with changes in team behavior -- thereby revealing common and unique team signatures. From a complexity science perspective, the model proves useful for identifying key performance factors in team sports and for studying the effects of given constraints on the exploitation of degeneracy to organize team behavior through various network structures. Future research can easily extend the model and apply it to other types of social networks.</p></details> |  |

The core challenge of this task lies in understanding the complex semantic information regarding multiple types of time constraints (e.g., before, first) in questions. Existing end-to-end methods implicitly model the time constraints by learning time-aware embeddings of questions and candidate answers, which is far from understanding the question comprehensively. Motivated by semantic-parsing-based approaches that explicitly model constraints in questions by generating logical forms with symbolic operators, we design fundamental temporal operators for time constraints and introduce a novel self-improvement Programming method for TKGQA (Prog-TQA). Specifically, Prog-TQA leverages the in-context learning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to understand the combinatory time constraints in the questions and generate corresponding program drafts with a few examples given. Then, it aligns these drafts to TKGs with the linking module and subsequently executes them to generate the answers. To enhance the ability to understand questions, Prog-TQA is further equipped with a self-improvement strategy to effectively bootstrap LLMs using high-quality self-generated drafts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Prog-TQA on MultiTQ and CronQuestions datasets, especially in the Hits@1 metric.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by LREC-COLING 2024 (long paper)</p></details> |

Most existing MTS forecasting models greatly suffer from distribution drift and degrade the forecasting performance over time. Existing methods address distribution drift via adapting to the latest arrived data or self-correcting per the meta knowledge derived from future data. Despite their great success in MTS forecasting, these methods hardly capture the intrinsic distribution changes, especially from a distributional perspective. Accordingly, we propose a novel framework temporal conditional variational autoencoder (TCVAE) to model the dynamic distributional dependencies over time between historical observations and future data in MTSs and infer the dependencies as a temporal conditional distribution to leverage latent variables. Specifically, a novel temporal Hawkes attention mechanism represents temporal factors subsequently fed into feed-forward networks to estimate the prior Gaussian distribution of latent variables. The representation of temporal factors further dynamically adjusts the structures of Transformer-based encoder and decoder to distribution changes by leveraging a gated attention mechanism. Moreover, we introduce conditional continuous normalization flow to transform the prior Gaussian to a complex and form-free distribution to facilitate flexible inference of the temporal conditional distribution. Extensive experiments conducted on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate the TCVAE's superior robustness and effectiveness over the state-of-the-art MTS forecasting baselines. We further illustrate the TCVAE applicability through multifaceted case studies and visualization in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems (TNNLS)</p></details> |

Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ reinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS). Both offline experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba display advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW'24) as an oral paper</p></details> |

We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05218v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However, challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist, particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model, utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted, followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so, our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions, improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore, we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

LfO can facilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and reducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a transformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and action pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation or inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While several existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity recognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However, SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single viewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the observed task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing occlusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and synchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present multi-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception of multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better recognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on two distinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairs under occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and other baselines. Our ablation studies further evaluate its performance under different ambient conditions and establish the contribution of the architecture components. As such, MVSA-Net offers a significantly more robust and deployable state-action trajectory generation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Deployable AI Workshop at AAAI-2024 and 'Towards Reliable and Deployable Learning-Based Robotic Systems' Workshop at CoRL2023</p></details> |

In this regard, a common shortcoming of current benchmark datasets is their limitation to sets of sample trajectories and a lack of actual ground truth distributions, which prevents the use of more expressive error metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance for model evaluation. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic dataset generation based on composite probabilistic B\'ezier curves, which is capable of generating ground truth data in terms of probability distributions over full trajectories. This allows the calculation of arbitrary posterior distributions. The paper showcases an exemplary trajectory prediction model evaluation using generated ground truth distribution data.</p></details> |  |

The evaluation is conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed. Therefore, this study presents a data-driven analysis with the intent to guide the future development of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS); 11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Autonomous Driving Safety with POP: A Framework for Accurate Partially Observed Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15685v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for safe and efficient autonomous driving, but handling partial observations presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial Observations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. The framework consists of two key stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature distillation. POP first employs SLL to help the model learn to reconstruct history representations, and then utilizes feature distillation as the fine-tuning task to transfer knowledge from the teacher model, which has been pre-trained with complete observations, to the student model, which has only few observations. POP achieves comparable results to top-performing methods in open-loop experiments and outperforms the baseline method in closed-loop simulations, including safety metrics. Qualitative results illustrate the superiority of POP in providing reasonable and safe trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Kalman Filtering based on Self-Attention Mechanism and Lattice Trajectory Piecewise Linear Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03915v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional Kalman filter (KF) is widely applied in control systems, but it relies heavily on the accuracy of the system model and noise parameters, leading to potential performance degradation when facing inaccuracies. To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the AIAA's Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

In contrast to the prevalent practice of validating RL models based on their optimal behavior learned during training, we posit that considering a range of edge-case trajectories provides a more comprehensive understanding of their inherent behavior. To induce such scenarios, we introduce a disturbance to the initial state, optimizing it through an evolutionary algorithm to generate a diverse population of demonstrations. To evaluate the fitness of trajectories, REACT incorporates a joint fitness function that encourages both local and global diversity in the encountered states and chosen actions. Through assessments with policies trained for varying durations in discrete and continuous environments, we demonstrate the descriptive power of REACT. Our results highlight its effectiveness in revealing nuanced aspects of RL models' behavior beyond optimal performance, thereby contributing to improved interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v3)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

| **[Creating a Trajectory for Code Writing: Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02464v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many students in introductory programming courses fare poorly in the code writing tasks of the final summative assessment. Such tasks are designed to assess whether novices have developed the analytical skills to translate from the given problem domain to coding. In the past researchers have used instruments such as code-explain and found that the extent of cognitive depth reached in these tasks correlated well with code writing ability. However, the need for manual marking and personalized interviews used for identifying cognitive difficulties limited the study to a small group of stragglers. To extend this work to larger groups, we have devised several question types with varying cognitive demands collectively called Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks (ARTs), which do not require manual marking. These tasks require levels of reasoning which can define a learning trajectory. This paper describes these instruments and the machine learning models used for validating them. We have used the data collected in an introductory programming course in the penultimate week of the semester which required attempting ART type instruments and code writing. Our preliminary research suggests ART type instruments can be combined with specific machine learning models to act as an effective learning trajectory and early prediction of code-writing skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments. Our work represents the first initiative towards Out-Of-Sight Trajectory prediction (OOSTraj), setting a new benchmark for future research.

| **[Traffic State Estimation from Vehicle Trajectories with Anisotropic Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02311v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately monitoring road traffic state is crucial for various applications, including travel time prediction, traffic control, and traffic safety. However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the congestion propagation in traffic flow data. The model parameters can be estimated by statistical inference using data from sparse probe vehicles or loop detectors. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs, along with simulated data representing a traffic bottleneck scenario. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation (TSE) scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment. We also test the traffic state estimation when traffic flow information is obtained from loop detectors. The results demonstrate the adaptability of our TSE method across different CV penetration rates and types of detectors, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in scenarios with sparse observation rates.</p></details> |  |

We propose two prior attention modules, namely Kinematics Prior Attention (KPA) and Trajectory Prior Attention (TPA) to take advantage of the known anatomical structure of the human body and motion trajectory information, to facilitate effective learning of global dependencies and features in the multi-head self-attention. KPA models kinematic relationships in the human body by constructing a topology of kinematics, while TPA builds a trajectory topology to learn the information of joint motion trajectory across frames. Yielding Q, K, V vectors with prior knowledge, the two modules enable KTPFormer to model both spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and HumanEva) show that KTPFormer achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our KPA and TPA modules have lightweight plug-and-play designs and can be integrated into various transformer-based networks (i.e., diffusion-based) to improve the performance with only a very small increase in the computational overhead.

While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

In this paper, we address this issue by combining a deep learning-based trajectory prediction model with risk potential field-based motion planning. In order to comprehensively predict the possible future trajectories of other vehicles, we propose a target-region based trajectory prediction model(TRTP) which considers every region a vehicle may arrive in the future. After that, we construct a risk potential field at each future time step based on the prediction results of TRTP, and integrate risk value to the objective function of Model Predictive Contouring Control(MPCC). This enables the uncertainty of other vehicles to be taken into account during the planning process. Balancing between risk and progress along the reference path can achieve both driving safety and efficiency at the same time. We also demonstrate the security and effectiveness performance of our method in the CARLA simulator.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly focus on developing compact neural networks to increase prediction precision on public datasets, typically employing a standardized input duration. However, a notable issue arises when these models are evaluated with varying observation lengths, leading to a significant performance drop, a phenomenon we term the Observation Length Shift. To address this issue, we introduce a general and effective framework, the FlexiLength Network (FLN), to enhance the robustness of existing trajectory prediction techniques against varying observation periods. Specifically, FLN integrates trajectory data with diverse observation lengths, incorporates FlexiLength Calibration (FLC) to acquire temporal invariant representations, and employs FlexiLength Adaptation (FLA) to further refine these representations for more accurate future trajectory predictions. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, ie, ETH/UCY, nuScenes, and Argoverse 1, demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FLN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood.

Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURESTEP: An Uncertainty-Aware Trajectory Optimization Framework to Enhance Visual Tool Tracking for Robust Surgical Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00123v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inaccurate tool localization is one of the main reasons for failures in automating surgical tasks. Imprecise robot kinematics and noisy observations caused by the poor visual acuity of an endoscopic camera make tool tracking challenging. Previous works in surgical automation adopt environment-specific setups or hard-coded strategies instead of explicitly considering motion and observation uncertainty of tool tracking in their policies. In this work, we present SURESTEP, an uncertainty-aware trajectory optimization framework for robust surgical automation. We model the uncertainty of tool tracking with the components motivated by the sources of noise in typical surgical scenes. Using a Gaussian assumption to propagate our uncertainty models through a given tool trajectory, SURESTEP provides a general framework that minimizes the upper bound on the entropy of the final estimated tool distribution. We compare SURESTEP with a baseline method on a real-world suture needle regrasping task under challenging environmental conditions, such as poor lighting and a moving endoscopic camera. The results over 60 regrasps on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) demonstrate that our optimized trajectories significantly outperform the un-optimized baseline.</p></details> |  |

| **[SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18452v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

Language-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18447v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings. The code can be found here: https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models via Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08533v4)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are a powerful tool for developing intelligent agents. By predicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies to be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data, i.e. in "in imagination". Existing world models are autoregressive in that they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows. In this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and classifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error for short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For short trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive diffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via on-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains. Thus, PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for accurate on-policy world modelling without autoregressive sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR, March 2024</p></details> |
| **[LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict the lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information in natural language as prompts for input into the LLM and employing a supervised fine-tuning technique to tailor the LLM specifically for our lane change prediction task. This allows us to utilize the LLM's powerful common sense reasoning abilities to understand complex interactive information, thereby improving the accuracy of long-term predictions. Furthermore, we incorporate explanatory requirements into the prompts in the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only can predict lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides explanations for its predictions, enhancing the interpretability. Extensive experiments on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

| **[Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles for Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17678v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> |  |

The diversity and uncertainty in socially interactive behaviors among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than other deterministic computer vision tasks. Researchers have made a lot of efforts to quantify the effects of these interactions on future trajectories through different mathematical models and network structures, but this problem has not been well solved. Inspired by marine animals that localize the positions of their companions underwater through echoes, we build a new anglebased trainable social interaction representation, named SocialCircle, for continuously reflecting the context of social interactions at different angular orientations relative to the target agent. We validate the effect of the proposed SocialCircle by training it along with several newly released trajectory prediction models, and experiments show that the SocialCircle not only quantitatively improves the prediction performance, but also qualitatively helps better simulate social interactions when forecasting pedestrian trajectories in a way that is consistent with human intuitions.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 accepted |

This trajectory is subsequently refined through sequential quadratic programming to improve its optimality and robustness. Our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by up to 79.72\% in reducing trajectory planning time.

| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning: Role of State Aggregation and Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17091v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the problem of offline reinforcement learning with value function realizability but without Bellman completeness. Previous work by Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022) left open the question whether a bounded concentrability coefficient along with trajectory-based offline data admits a polynomial sample complexity. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question for the task of offline policy evaluation. In addition to addressing this question, we provide a rather complete picture for offline policy evaluation with only value function realizability. Our primary findings are threefold: 1) The sample complexity of offline policy evaluation is governed by the concentrability coefficient in an aggregated Markov Transition Model jointly determined by the function class and the offline data distribution, rather than that in the original MDP. This unifies and generalizes the ideas of Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022), 2) The concentrability coefficient in the aggregated Markov Transition Model may grow exponentially with the horizon length, even when the concentrability coefficient in the original MDP is small and the offline data is admissible (i.e., the data distribution equals the occupancy measure of some policy), 3) Under value function realizability, there is a generic reduction that can convert any hard instance with admissible data to a hard instance with trajectory data, implying that trajectory data offers no extra benefits over admissible data. These three pieces jointly resolve the open problem, though each of them could be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we 1) decompose our polygonal environment into different overlapping cells 2) write out our polynomial trajectories as the output of a reference dynamical system with given initial conditions 3) formulate convergence and safety constraints as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) on our controller using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and 4) solve a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem with convergence and safety constraints imposed to synthesize a controller for each convex cell. Extensive simulations are included to test our motion planning method under different initial conditions and different reference trajectories. The synthesized controller is robust to changes in initial conditions and is always safe relative to the boundaries of the polygonal environment.</p></details> |  |

This paper for the first time proposes a surveillance system that utilizes low-cost magnetic sensors for detecting and tracking vehicles continuously along the road. The system uses multiple sensors mounted along the roadside and lane boundaries to capture the movement of vehicles. Real-time measurement data is collected by base stations and processed to produce vehicle trajectories that include position, timestamp, and speed. To address the challenge of tracking vehicles continuously on a road network using a large amount of unlabeled magnetic sensor measurements, we first define a vehicle trajectory tracking problem. We then propose a graph-based data association algorithm to track each detected vehicle, and design a related online algorithm framework respectively. We finally validate the performance via both experimental simulation and real-world road deployment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution provides a cost-effective solution to capture the driving status of vehicles and on that basis form various traffic safety and efficiency applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

Most existing works capture map information through an one-stage interaction with map by vector-based attention, to provide map constraints for social interaction and multi-modal differentiation. However, these methods have to encode all required map rules into the focal agent's feature, so as to retain all possible intentions' paths while at the meantime to adapt to potential social interaction. In this work, a progressive interaction network is proposed to enable the agent's feature to progressively focus on relevant maps, in order to better learn agents' feature representation capturing the relevant map constraints. The network progressively encode the complex influence of map constraints into the agent's feature through graph convolutions at the following three stages: after historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. In addition, a weight allocation mechanism is proposed for multi-modal training, so that each mode can obtain learning opportunities from a single-mode ground truth. Experiments have validated the superiority of progressive interactions to the existing one-stage interaction, and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Encouraging results were obtained in the challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we present a novel Conditional RNN(CRNN) for diffusion models to efficiently generate trajectories. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive training method that ensures that the diffusion model generates more traversable trajectories.

We propose to combine trajectory sampling and deep Gaussian covariance network (DGCN) for a data-efficient solution to MBRL problems in an optimal control setting. We compare trajectory sampling with density-based approximation for uncertainty propagation using three different probabilistic world models; Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and DGCNs. We provide empirical evidence using four different well-known test environments, that our method improves the sample-efficiency over other combinations of uncertainty propagation methods and probabilistic models.

In recent years, emerging data-driven deep learning-based methods have shown great promise for these two tasks in learning various traffic scenarios and improving average performance without assuming physical models. However, it remains a challenging problem for these methods to ensure that the generated/predicted trajectories are physically realistic. This challenge arises because learning-based approaches often function as opaque black boxes and do not adhere to physical laws. Conversely, existing model-based methods provide physically feasible results but are constrained by predefined model structures, limiting their capabilities to address complex scenarios. To address the limitations of these two types of approaches, we propose a new method that integrates kinematic knowledge into neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) and designs a variational autoencoder based on this latent kinematics-aware SDE (LK-SDE) to generate vehicle motions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both model-based and learning-based baselines in producing physically realistic and precisely controllable vehicle trajectories.

However, its application in geometric tasks remains underexplored, partially due to the absence of a standardized evaluation method for geometric representations. To address this gap, we introduce a new pose-estimation benchmark for assessing SSL geometric representations, which demands training without semantic or pose labels and achieving proficiency in both semantic and geometric downstream tasks. On this benchmark, we study enhancing SSL geometric representations without sacrificing semantic classification accuracy. We find that leveraging mid-layer representations improves pose-estimation performance by 10-20%. Further, we introduce an unsupervised trajectory-regularization loss, which improves performance by an additional 4% and improves generalization ability on out-of-distribution data. We hope the proposed benchmark and methods offer new insights and improvements in self-supervised geometric representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Addressing these identified shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel framework, the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) model. PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods for traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual learning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a predicted residual as a correction to it. It preserves the interpretability inherent to physics-based models and has reduced data requirements compared to data-driven methods. Experiments were conducted using a real-world vehicle trajectory dataset. We proposed a PERL model, with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as its physics car-following model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as its residual learning model. We compare this PERL model with the physics car-following model, data-driven model, and other physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The result reveals that PERL achieves better prediction with a small dataset, compared to the physics model, data-driven model, and PINN model. Second, the PERL model showed faster convergence during training, offering comparable performance with fewer training samples than the data-driven model and PINN model. Sensitivity analysis also proves comparable performance of PERL using another residual learning model and a physics car-following model.</p></details> |  |

While numerous strategies have been developed to enhance the robustness of trajectory prediction models, these methods are predominantly heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy observations. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for the task of trajectory prediction. To this end, we address the inherent challenges associated with trajectory prediction, including unbounded outputs, and mutli-modality, resulting in a model that provides guaranteed robustness. Furthermore, we integrate a denoiser into our method to further improve the performance. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique across various baselines and using standard trajectory prediction datasets.

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Progressive trajectory matching for medical dataset distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13469v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is essential but challenging to share medical image datasets due to privacy issues, which prohibit building foundation models and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset distillation method to condense the original medical image datasets into a synthetic one that preserves useful information for building an analysis model without accessing the original datasets. Existing methods tackle only natural images by randomly matching parts of the training trajectories of the model parameters trained by the whole real datasets. However, through extensive experiments on medical image datasets, the training process is extremely unstable and achieves inferior distillation results. To solve these barriers, we propose to design a novel progressive trajectory matching strategy to improve the training stability for medical image dataset distillation. Additionally, it is observed that improved stability prevents the synthetic dataset diversity and final performance improvements. Therefore, we propose a dynamic overlap mitigation module that improves the synthetic dataset diversity by dynamically eliminating the overlap across different images and retraining parts of the synthetic images for better convergence. Finally, we propose a new medical image dataset distillation benchmark of various modalities and configurations to promote fair evaluations. It is validated that our proposed method achieves 8.33% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average, and 11.7% improvement when ipc=2 (i.e., image per class is 2). Codes and benchmarks will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel methodological framework for the analysis of health trajectories and survival outcomes in heart failure patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03138v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heart failure (HF) contributes to circa 200,000 annual hospitalizations in France. With the increasing age of HF patients, elucidating the specific causes of inpatient mortality became a public health problematic. We introduce a novel methodological framework designed to identify prevalent health trajectories and investigate their impact on death. The initial step involves applying sequential pattern mining to characterize patients' trajectories, followed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on a new metric for measuring the distance between hospitalization diagnoses. Finally, a survival analysis is conducted to assess survival outcomes. The application of this framework to HF patients from a representative sample of the French population demonstrates its methodological significance in enhancing the analysis of healthcare trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Despite its advantages, a significant challenge within simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel generative framework, CaDRE, which is specifically designed for generating diverse and controllable safety-critical scenarios using real-world trajectories. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world data, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization techniques. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and high-quality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning and sampling-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of flow matching methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the optimal transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for fast integration of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristic minibatch OT approximations. To address this issue, we develop a novel optimal flow matching approach which recovers the straight OT displacement for the quadratic cost in just one flow matching step.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-Cubed: Latent Diffusion Trajectory Optimisation for Dexterous Deformable Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12861v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering dexterous robotic manipulation of deformable objects is vital for overcoming the limitations of parallel grippers in real-world applications. Current trajectory optimisation approaches often struggle to solve such tasks due to the large search space and the limited task information available from a cost function. In this work, we propose D-Cubed, a novel trajectory optimisation method using a latent diffusion model (LDM) trained from a task-agnostic play dataset to solve dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. D-Cubed learns a skill-latent space that encodes short-horizon actions in the play dataset using a VAE and trains a LDM to compose the skill latents into a skill trajectory, representing a long-horizon action trajectory in the dataset. To optimise a trajectory for a target task, we introduce a novel gradient-free guided sampling method that employs the Cross-Entropy method within the reverse diffusion process. In particular, D-Cubed samples a small number of noisy skill trajectories using the LDM for exploration and evaluates the trajectories in simulation. Then, D-Cubed selects the trajectory with the lowest cost for the subsequent reverse process. This effectively explores promising solution areas and optimises the sampled trajectories towards a target task throughout the reverse diffusion process. Through empirical evaluation on a public benchmark of dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that D-Cubed outperforms traditional trajectory optimisation and competitive baseline approaches by a significant margin. We further demonstrate that trajectories found by D-Cubed readily transfer to a real-world LEAP hand on a folding task.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://applied-ai-lab.github.io/D-cubed/</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applied tasks such as image editing and restoration. The success of diffusion models lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. Thus, this work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.

| **[Boosting Transferability in Vision-Language Attacks via Diversification along the Intersection Region of Adversarial Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12445v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in comprehending both images and text, yet they remain susceptible to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs). Strengthening adversarial attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can stimulate further research on constructing reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks (e.g., Image-Text Retrieval(ITR), Visual Grounding(VG), Image Captioning(IC)).</p></details> |  |

The vehicle moves with unit speed and the laser, having a finite range, can rotate in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction with a bounded angular rate. From an arbitrary initial position and orientation, the objective is to steer the system so that a given static target is within the range of the laser and the laser is oriented at it in minimum time. We characterize multiple properties of the optimal trajectory and establish that the optimal trajectory for the Dubins-laser system is one out of a total of 16 candidates. Finally, we provide numerical insights that illustrate the properties characterized in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Gain Disturbance Observer for Robust Trajectory Tracking of Quadrotors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19115v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple method to boost the robustness of quadrotors in trajectory tracking. The presented method features a high-gain disturbance observer (HGDO) that provides disturbance estimates in real-time. The estimates are then used in a trajectory control law to compensate for disturbance effects. We present theoretical convergence results showing that the proposed HGDO can quickly converge to an adjustable neighborhood of actual disturbance values. We will then integrate the disturbance estimates with a typical robust trajectory controller, namely sliding mode control (SMC), and present Lyapunov stability analysis to establish the boundedness of trajectory tracking errors. However, our stability analysis can be easily extended to other Lyapunov-based controllers to develop different HGDO-based controllers with formal stability guarantees. We evaluate the proposed HGDO-based control method using both simulation and laboratory experiments in various scenarios and in the presence of external disturbances. Our results indicate that the addition of HGDO to a quadrotor trajectory controller can significantly improve the accuracy and precision of trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reachability-based Trajectory Design via Exact Formulation of Implicit Neural Signed Distance Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12280v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating receding-horizon motion trajectories for autonomous vehicles in real-time while also providing safety guarantees is challenging. This is because a future trajectory needs to be planned before the previously computed trajectory is completely executed. This becomes even more difficult if the trajectory is required to satisfy continuous-time collision-avoidance constraints while accounting for a large number of obstacles. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel real-time, receding-horizon motion planning algorithm named REachability-based trajectory Design via Exact Formulation of Implicit NEural signed Distance functions (REDEFINED). REDEFINED first applies offline reachability analysis to compute zonotope-based reachable sets that overapproximate the motion of the ego vehicle. During online planning, REDEFINED leverages zonotope arithmetic to construct a neural implicit representation that computes the exact signed distance between a parameterized swept volume of the ego vehicle and obstacle vehicles. REDEFINED then implements a novel, real-time optimization framework that utilizes the neural network to construct a collision avoidance constraint. REDEFINED is compared to a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and is demonstrated to successfully enable the vehicle to safely navigate through complex environments. Code, data, and video demonstrations can be found at https://roahmlab.github.io/redefined/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Informed Spectral Normalized Gaussian Processes for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11966v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior parameter distributions provide an elegant way to represent prior expert and world knowledge for informed learning. Previous work has shown that using such informative priors to regularize probabilistic deep learning (DL) models increases their performance and data-efficiency. However, commonly used sampling-based approximations for probabilistic DL models can be computationally expensive, requiring multiple inference passes and longer training times. Promising alternatives are compute-efficient last layer kernel approximations like spectral normalized Gaussian processes (SNGPs). We propose a novel regularization-based continual learning method for SNGPs, which enables the use of informative priors that represent prior knowledge learned from previous tasks. Our proposal builds upon well-established methods and requires no rehearsal memory or parameter expansion. We apply our informed SNGP model to the trajectory prediction problem in autonomous driving by integrating prior drivability knowledge. On two public datasets, we investigate its performance under diminishing training data and across locations, and thereby demonstrate an increase in data-efficiency and robustness to location-transfers over non-informed and informed baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCNet: Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Trajectories and Correlated Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11818v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) is to efficiently capture long-range spatial interactions over time from the video input. To address this challenge, we propose TCNet, a hybrid network that effectively models spatio-temporal information from Trajectories and Correlated regions. TCNet's trajectory module transforms frames into aligned trajectories composed of continuous visual tokens. In addition, for a query token, self-attention is learned along the trajectory. As such, our network can also focus on fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns, such as finger movements, of a specific region in motion. TCNet's correlation module uses a novel dynamic attention mechanism that filters out irrelevant frame regions. Additionally, it assigns dynamic key-value tokens from correlated regions to each query. Both innovations significantly reduce the computation cost and memory. We perform experiments on four large-scale datasets: PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL, and CSL-Daily, respectively. Our results demonstrate that TCNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, we improve over the previous state-of-the-art by 1.5% and 1.0% word error rate on PHOENIX14 and PHOENIX14-T, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PITA: Physics-Informed Trajectory Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11728v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Validating robotic systems in safety-critical appli-cations requires testing in many scenarios including rare edgecases that are unlikely to occur, requiring to complement real-world testing with testing in simulation. Generative models canbe used to augment real-world datasets with generated data toproduce edge case scenarios by sampling in a learned latentspace. Autoencoders can learn said latent representation for aspecific domain by learning to reconstruct the input data froma lower-dimensional intermediate representation. However, theresulting trajectories are not necessarily physically plausible, butinstead typically contain noise that is not present in the inputtrajectory. To resolve this issue, we propose the novel Physics-Informed Trajectory Autoencoder (PITA) architecture, whichincorporates a physical dynamics model into the loss functionof the autoencoder. This results in smooth trajectories that notonly reconstruct the input trajectory but also adhere to thephysical model. We evaluate PITA on a real-world dataset ofvehicle trajectories and compare its performance to a normalautoencoder and a state-of-the-art action-space autoencoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajectoryNAS: A Neural Architecture Search for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11695v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems are a rapidly evolving technology that enables driverless car production. Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, enabling cars to anticipate the movements of surrounding objects for safe navigation. Trajectory prediction using Lidar point-cloud data performs better than 2D images due to providing 3D information. However, processing point-cloud data is more complicated and time-consuming than 2D images. Hence, state-of-the-art 3D trajectory predictions using point-cloud data suffer from slow and erroneous predictions. This paper introduces TrajectoryNAS, a pioneering method that focuses on utilizing point cloud data for trajectory prediction. By leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), TrajectoryNAS automates the design of trajectory prediction models, encompassing object detection, tracking, and forecasting in a cohesive manner. This approach not only addresses the complex interdependencies among these tasks but also emphasizes the importance of accuracy and efficiency in trajectory modeling. Through empirical studies, TrajectoryNAS demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of autonomous driving systems, marking a significant advancement in the field.Experimental results reveal that TrajcetoryNAS yield a minimum of 4.8 higger accuracy and 1.1* lower latency over competing methods on the NuScenes dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Lossless Dataset Distillation via Difficulty-Aligned Trajectory Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05773v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ultimate goal of Dataset Distillation is to synthesize a small synthetic dataset such that a model trained on this synthetic set will perform equally well as a model trained on the full, real dataset. Until now, no method of Dataset Distillation has reached this completely lossless goal, in part due to the fact that previous methods only remain effective when the total number of synthetic samples is extremely small. Since only so much information can be contained in such a small number of samples, it seems that to achieve truly loss dataset distillation, we must develop a distillation method that remains effective as the size of the synthetic dataset grows. In this work, we present such an algorithm and elucidate why existing methods fail to generate larger, high-quality synthetic sets. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on trajectory-matching, or optimizing the synthetic data to induce similar long-term training dynamics as the real data. We empirically find that the training stage of the trajectories we choose to match (i.e., early or late) greatly affects the effectiveness of the distilled dataset. Specifically, early trajectories (where the teacher network learns easy patterns) work well for a low-cardinality synthetic set since there are fewer examples wherein to distribute the necessary information. Conversely, late trajectories (where the teacher network learns hard patterns) provide better signals for larger synthetic sets since there are now enough samples to represent the necessary complex patterns. Based on our findings, we propose to align the difficulty of the generated patterns with the size of the synthetic dataset. In doing so, we successfully scale trajectory matching-based methods to larger synthetic datasets, achieving lossless dataset distillation for the very first time. Code and distilled datasets are available at https://gzyaftermath.github.io/DATM.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First lossless dataset distillation method, accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, a diffusion-based generative model for multi-agent trajectory prediction is proposed. The model is capable of capturing the complex interactions between traffic participants and the environment, accurately learning the multimodal nature of the data. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed on large-scale datasets of real-world traffic scenarios, showing that our model outperforms several well-established methods in terms of prediction accuracy. By the incorporation of differential motion constraints on the model output, we illustrate that our model is capable of generating a diverse set of realistic future trajectories. Through the use of an interaction-aware guidance signal, we further demonstrate that the model can be adapted to predict the behavior of less cooperative agents, emphasizing its practical applicability under uncertain traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeTO: Learning Constrained Visuomotor Policy with Differentiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17500v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces LeTO, a method for learning constrained visuomotor policy via differentiable trajectory optimization. Our approach uniquely integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraints information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This "gray box" method marries the optimization-based safety and interpretability with the powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and on the real robot. In simulation, LeTO achieves a success rate comparable to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, but the generated trajectories are of less uncertainty, higher quality, and smoother. In real-world experiments, we deployed LeTO to handle constraints-critical tasks. The results show the effectiveness of LeTO comparing with state-of-the-art imitation learning approaches. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Variational Sampling of Temporal Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11418v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A deterministic temporal process can be determined by its trajectory, an element in the product space of (a) initial condition $z_0 \in \mathcal{Z}$ and (b) transition function $f: (\mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{T}) \to \mathcal{Z}$ often influenced by the control of the underlying dynamical system. Existing methods often model the transition function as a differential equation or as a recurrent neural network. Despite their effectiveness in predicting future measurements, few results have successfully established a method for sampling and statistical inference of trajectories using neural networks, partially due to constraints in the parameterization. In this work, we introduce a mechanism to learn the distribution of trajectories by parameterizing the transition function $f$ explicitly as an element in a function space. Our framework allows efficient synthesis of novel trajectories, while also directly providing a convenient tool for inference, i.e., uncertainty estimation, likelihood evaluations and out of distribution detection for abnormal trajectories. These capabilities can have implications for various downstream tasks, e.g., simulation and evaluation for reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pioneering SE(2)-Equivariant Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11304v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning the trajectory of the controlled ego vehicle is a key challenge in automated driving. As for human drivers, predicting the motions of surrounding vehicles is important to plan the own actions. Recent motion prediction methods utilize equivariant neural networks to exploit geometric symmetries in the scene. However, no existing method combines motion prediction and trajectory planning in a joint step while guaranteeing equivariance under roto-translations of the input space. We address this gap by proposing a lightweight equivariant planning model that generates multi-modal joint predictions for all vehicles and selects one mode as the ego plan. The equivariant network design improves sample efficiency, guarantees output stability, and reduces model parameters. We further propose equivariant route attraction to guide the ego vehicle along a high-level route provided by an off-the-shelf GPS navigation system. This module creates a momentum from embedded vehicle positions toward the route in latent space while keeping the equivariance property. Route attraction enables goal-oriented behavior without forcing the vehicle to stick to the exact route. We conduct experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset to investigate the capability of our planner. The results show that the planned trajectory is stable under roto-translations of the input scene which demonstrates the equivariance of our model. Despite using only a small split of the dataset for training, our method improves L2 distance at 3 s by 20.6 % and surpasses the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[PINSAT: Parallelized Interleaving of Graph Search and Trajectory Optimization for Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08948v2)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a widely used technique in robot motion planning for letting the dynamics and constraints on the system shape and synthesize complex behaviors. Several previous works have shown its benefits in high-dimensional continuous state spaces and under differential constraints. However, long time horizons and planning around obstacles in non-convex spaces pose challenges in guaranteeing convergence or finding optimal solutions. As a result, discrete graph search planners and sampling-based planers are preferred when facing obstacle-cluttered environments. A recently developed algorithm called INSAT effectively combines graph search in the low-dimensional subspace and trajectory optimization in the full-dimensional space for global kinodynamic planning over long horizons. Although INSAT successfully reasoned about and solved complex planning problems, the numerous expensive calls to an optimizer resulted in large planning times, thereby limiting its practical use. Inspired by the recent work on edge-based parallel graph search, we present PINSAT, which introduces systematic parallelization in INSAT to achieve lower planning times and higher success rates, while maintaining significantly lower costs over relevant baselines. We demonstrate PINSAT by evaluating it on 6 DoF kinodynamic manipulation planning with obstacles.</p></details> | Under review |

While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Diffusion models, which are currently state-of-the-art for learned trajectory generation in long-horizon planning and offline reinforcement learning tasks, rely on a computationally intensive iterative sampling process. This slow process impedes the dynamic capabilities of robotic systems. In contrast, we introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel data-driven approach that utilizes flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient and fast trajectory generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of T-CFM on three separate tasks: adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with an increase of 35% in predictive accuracy and 142% increase in planning performance. Notably, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion-based models without sacrificing accuracy, which is crucial for real-time decision making in robotics.</p></details> |  |

However, adding dynamic constraints makes the motion planning problem significantly harder, as it requires solving two-value boundary problems (computationally expensive) or propagating random control inputs (uninformative). Alternatively, Iterative Discontinuity Bounded A* (iDb-A*), introduced in our previous study, combines search and optimization iteratively. The search step connects short trajectories (motion primitives) while allowing a bounded discontinuity between the motion primitives, which is later repaired in the trajectory optimization step. Building upon these foundations, in this paper, we present iDb-RRT, a sampling-based kinodynamic motion planning algorithm that combines motion primitives and trajectory optimization within the RRT framework. iDb-RRT is probabilistically complete and can be implemented in forward or bidirectional mode. We have tested our algorithm across a benchmark suite comprising 30 problems, spanning 8 different systems, and shown that iDb-RRT can find solutions up to 10x faster than previous methods, especially in complex scenarios that require long trajectories or involve navigating through narrow passages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

Reducing the unactuated payload motion is a crucial issue for under-actuated tower cranes with spherical pendulum dynamics. The planned trajectory should be optimal in terms of both operating time and energy consumption, to facilitate optimum output spending optimum effort. This article proposes an anti-swing tower crane trajectory planner that can provide time-energy optimal solutions for the Computer-Aided Lift Planning (CALP) system developed at Nanyang Technological University, which facilitates collision-free lifting path planning of robotized tower cranes in autonomous construction sites. The current work introduces a trajectory planning module to the system that utilizes the geometric outputs from the path planning module and optimally scales them with time information. Firstly, analyzing the non-linear dynamics of the crane operations, the tower crane is established as differentially flat. Subsequently, the multi-objective trajectory optimization problems for all the crane operations are formulated in the flat output space through consideration of the mechanical and safety constraints. Two multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, namely Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) and Generalized Differential Evolution 3 (GDE3), are extensively compared via statistical measures based on the closeness of solutions to the Pareto front, distribution of solutions in the solution space and the runtime, to select the optimization engine of the planner. Finally, the crane operation trajectories are obtained via the corresponding planned flat output trajectories. Studies simulating real-world lifting scenarios are conducted to verify the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed module of the lift planning system.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

The current auto-bidding algorithms typically employ reinforcement learning (RL). However, due to safety concerns, most RL-based auto-bidding policies are trained in simulation, leading to a performance degradation when deployed in online environments. To narrow this gap, we can deploy multiple auto-bidding agents in parallel to collect a large interaction dataset. Offline RL algorithms can then be utilized to train a new policy. The trained policy can subsequently be deployed for further data collection, resulting in an iterative training framework, which we refer to as iterative offline RL. In this work, we identify the performance bottleneck of this iterative offline RL framework, which originates from the ineffective exploration and exploitation caused by the inherent conservatism of offline RL algorithms. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose Trajectory-wise Exploration and Exploitation (TEE), which introduces a novel data collecting and data utilization method for iterative offline RL from a trajectory perspective. Furthermore, to ensure the safety of online exploration while preserving the dataset quality for TEE, we propose Safe Exploration by Adaptive Action Selection (SEAS). Both offline experiments and real-world experiments on Alibaba display advertising platform demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by The Web Conference 2024 (WWW'24) as an oral paper</p></details> |
| **[Collision-Free Trajectory Optimization in Cluttered Environments with Sums-of-Squares Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05242v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a trajectory optimization approach for robot navigation in cluttered 3D environments. We represent the robot's geometry as a semialgebraic set defined by polynomial inequalities such that robots with general shapes can be suitably characterized. To address the robot navigation task in obstacle-dense environments, we exploit the free space directly to construct a sequence of free regions, and allocate each waypoint on the trajectory to a specific region. Then, we incorporate a uniform scaling factor for each free region, and formulate a Sums-of-Squares (SOS) optimization problem that renders the containment relationship between the robot and the free space computationally tractable. The SOS optimization problem is further reformulated to a semidefinite program (SDP), and the collision-free constraints are shown to be equivalent to limiting the scaling factor along the entire trajectory. In this context, the robot at a specific configuration is tailored to stay within the free region. Next, to solve the trajectory optimization problem with the proposed safety constraints (which are implicitly dependent on the robot configurations), we derive the analytical solution to the gradient of the minimum scaling factor with respect to the robot configuration. As a result, this seamlessly facilitates the use of gradient-based methods in efficient solving of the trajectory optimization problem. Through a series of simulations and real-world experiments, the proposed trajectory optimization approach is validated in various challenging scenarios, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating collision-free trajectories in dense and intricate environments populated with obstacles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent Long-term 3D Human Pose Forecasting via Interaction-aware Trajectory Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05218v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human pose forecasting garners attention for its diverse applications. However, challenges in modeling the multi-modal nature of human motion and intricate interactions among agents persist, particularly with longer timescales and more agents. In this paper, we propose an interaction-aware trajectory-conditioned long-term multi-agent human pose forecasting model, utilizing a coarse-to-fine prediction approach: multi-modal global trajectories are initially forecasted, followed by respective local pose forecasts conditioned on each mode. In doing so, our Trajectory2Pose model introduces a graph-based agent-wise interaction module for a reciprocal forecast of local motion-conditioned global trajectory and trajectory-conditioned local pose. Our model effectively handles the multi-modality of human motion and the complexity of long-term multi-agent interactions, improving performance in complex environments. Furthermore, we address the lack of long-term (6s+) multi-agent (5+) datasets by constructing a new dataset from real-world images and 2D annotations, enabling a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed model. State-of-the-art prediction performance on both complex and simpler datasets confirms the generalized effectiveness of our method.

| **[MVSA-Net: Multi-View State-Action Recognition for Robust and Deployable Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08393v3)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The learn-from-observation (LfO) paradigm is a human-inspired mode for a robot to learn to perform a task simply by watching it being performed. LfO can facilitate robot integration on factory floors by minimizing disruption and reducing tedious programming. A key component of the LfO pipeline is a transformation of the depth camera frames to the corresponding task state and action pairs, which are then relayed to learning techniques such as imitation or inverse reinforcement learning for understanding the task parameters. While several existing computer vision models analyze videos for activity recognition, SA-Net specifically targets robotic LfO from RGB-D data. However, SA-Net and many other models analyze frame data captured from a single viewpoint. Their analysis is therefore highly sensitive to occlusions of the observed task, which are frequent in deployments. An obvious way of reducing occlusions is to simultaneously observe the task from multiple viewpoints and synchronously fuse the multiple streams in the model. Toward this, we present multi-view SA-Net, which generalizes the SA-Net model to allow the perception of multiple viewpoints of the task activity, integrate them, and better recognize the state and action in each frame. Performance evaluations on two distinct domains establish that MVSA-Net recognizes the state-action pairs under occlusion more accurately compared to single-view MVSA-Net and other baselines. Our ablation studies further evaluate its performance under different ambient conditions and establish the contribution of the architecture components. As such, MVSA-Net offers a significantly more robust and deployable state-action trajectory generation compared to previous methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at Deployable AI Workshop at AAAI-2024 and 'Towards Reliable and Deployable Learning-Based Robotic Systems' Workshop at CoRL2023</p></details> |

| **[Generating Synthetic Ground Truth Distributions for Multi-step Trajectory Prediction using Probabilistic Composite Bézier Curves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04397v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An appropriate data basis grants one of the most important aspects for training and evaluating probabilistic trajectory prediction models based on neural networks. In this regard, a common shortcoming of current benchmark datasets is their limitation to sets of sample trajectories and a lack of actual ground truth distributions, which prevents the use of more expressive error metrics, such as the Wasserstein distance for model evaluation. Towards this end, this paper proposes a novel approach to synthetic dataset generation based on composite probabilistic B\'ezier curves, which is capable of generating ground truth data in terms of probability distributions over full trajectories. This allows the calculation of arbitrary posterior distributions. The paper showcases an exemplary trajectory prediction model evaluation using generated ground truth distribution data.</p></details> |  |

The evaluation is conducted on the widely-used ETH/UCY dataset where the Average Displacement Error (ADE) and the Final Displacement Error (FDE) are reported. Alongside this, we perform an ablation study to investigate the impact of the observed motion history on prediction performance. To evaluate the scalability of each approach when confronted with varying amounts of agents, the inference time of each model is measured. Following a quantitative analysis, the resulting predictions are compared in a qualitative manner, giving insight into the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches. The results demonstrate that although a constant velocity model (CVM) provides a good approximation of the overall dynamics in the majority of cases, additional features need to be incorporated to reflect common pedestrian behavior observed. Therefore, this study presents a data-driven analysis with the intent to guide the future development of pedestrian trajectory prediction algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (T-ITS); 11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Improving Autonomous Driving Safety with POP: A Framework for Accurate Partially Observed Trajectory Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15685v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory prediction is crucial for safe and efficient autonomous driving, but handling partial observations presents significant challenges. To address this, we propose a novel trajectory prediction framework called Partial Observations Prediction (POP) for congested urban road scenarios. The framework consists of two key stages: self-supervised learning (SSL) and feature distillation. POP first employs SLL to help the model learn to reconstruct history representations, and then utilizes feature distillation as the fine-tuning task to transfer knowledge from the teacher model, which has been pre-trained with complete observations, to the student model, which has only few observations. POP achieves comparable results to top-performing methods in open-loop experiments and outperforms the baseline method in closed-loop simulations, including safety metrics. Qualitative results illustrate the superiority of POP in providing reasonable and safe trajectory predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nonlinear Kalman Filtering based on Self-Attention Mechanism and Lattice Trajectory Piecewise Linear Approximation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03915v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The traditional Kalman filter (KF) is widely applied in control systems, but it relies heavily on the accuracy of the system model and noise parameters, leading to potential performance degradation when facing inaccuracies. To address this issue, introducing neural networks into the KF framework offers a data-driven solution to compensate for these inaccuracies, improving the filter's performance while maintaining interpretability. Nevertheless, existing studies mostly employ recurrent neural network (RNN), which fails to fully capture the dependencies among state sequences and lead to an unstable training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Kalman filtering algorithm named the attention Kalman filter (AtKF), which incorporates a self-attention network to capture the dependencies among state sequences. To address the instability in the recursive training process, a parallel pre-training strategy is devised. Specifically, this strategy involves piecewise linearizing the system via lattice trajectory piecewise linear (LTPWL) expression, and generating pre-training data through a batch estimation algorithm, which exploits the self-attention mechanism's parallel processing ability. Experimental results on a two-dimensional nonlinear system demonstrate that AtKF outperforms other filters under noise disturbances and model mismatches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Shallow Encounters' Impact on Asteroid Deflection Prediction and Implications on Trajectory Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04613v3)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Analytical approximations are commonly employed in the initial trajectory design phase of a mission to rapidly explore a broad design space. In the context of an asteroid deflection mission, accurately predicting deflection is crucial to determining the spacecraft's trajectory that will produce the desired outcome. However, the dynamics involved are intricate, and simplistic models may not fully capture the system's complexity. This study assesses the precision and limitations of analytical models in predicting deflection, comparing them to more accurate numerical simulations. The findings reveal that encounters with perturbing bodies, even at significant distances (a dozen times the radii of the sphere of influence of the perturbing planet), can markedly disturb the deflected asteroid's trajectory, resulting in notable disparities between analytical and numerical predictions. The underlying reasons for this phenomenon are explained, and provisional general guidelines are provided to assist mission analysts in addressing such occurrences. By comprehending the impact of shallow encounters on deflection, this study equips designers with the knowledge to make informed decisions throughout the trajectory planning process, enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of asteroid deflection missions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the AIAA's Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics.

In contrast to the prevalent practice of validating RL models based on their optimal behavior learned during training, we posit that considering a range of edge-case trajectories provides a more comprehensive understanding of their inherent behavior. To induce such scenarios, we introduce a disturbance to the initial state, optimizing it through an evolutionary algorithm to generate a diverse population of demonstrations. To evaluate the fitness of trajectories, REACT incorporates a joint fitness function that encourages both local and global diversity in the encountered states and chosen actions. Through assessments with policies trained for varying durations in discrete and continuous environments, we demonstrate the descriptive power of REACT. Our results highlight its effectiveness in revealing nuanced aspects of RL models' behavior beyond optimal performance, thereby contributing to improved interpretability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Bi-level Trajectory Optimization on Uneven Terrains with Differentiable Wheel-Terrain Interaction Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03307v1)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Navigation of wheeled vehicles on uneven terrain necessitates going beyond the 2D approaches for trajectory planning. Specifically, it is essential to incorporate the full 6dof variation of vehicle pose and its associated stability cost in the planning process. To this end, most recent works aim to learn a neural network model to predict the vehicle evolution. However, such approaches are data-intensive and fraught with generalization issues. In this paper, we present a purely model-based approach that just requires the digital elevation information of the terrain. Specifically, we express the wheel-terrain interaction and 6dof pose prediction as a non-linear least squares (NLS) problem. As a result, trajectory planning can be viewed as a bi-level optimization. The inner optimization layer predicts the pose on the terrain along a given trajectory, while the outer layer deforms the trajectory itself to reduce the stability and kinematic costs of the pose. We improve the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that our NLS based pose prediction closely matches the output from a high-fidelity physics engine. This result coupled with the fact that we can query gradients of the NLS solver, makes our pose predictor, a differentiable wheel-terrain interaction model. We further leverage this differentiability to efficiently solve the proposed bi-level trajectory optimization problem. Finally, we perform extensive experiments, and comparison with a baseline to showcase the effectiveness of our approach in obtaining smooth, stable trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Generalizable Tool-use Skills through Trajectory Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00156v3)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems that efficiently utilize tools can assist humans in completing many common tasks such as cooking and cleaning. However, current systems fall short of matching human-level of intelligence in terms of adapting to novel tools. Prior works based on affordance often make strong assumptions about the environments and cannot scale to more complex, contact-rich tasks. In this work, we tackle this challenge and explore how agents can learn to use previously unseen tools to manipulate deformable objects. We propose to learn a generative model of the tool-use trajectories as a sequence of tool point clouds, which generalizes to different tool shapes. Given any novel tool, we first generate a tool-use trajectory and then optimize the sequence of tool poses to align with the generated trajectory. We train a single model on four different challenging deformable object manipulation tasks, using demonstration data from only one tool per task. The model generalizes to various novel tools, significantly outperforming baselines. We further test our trained policy in the real world with unseen tools, where it achieves the performance comparable to human.

| **[Creating a Trajectory for Code Writing: Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02464v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many students in introductory programming courses fare poorly in the code writing tasks of the final summative assessment. Such tasks are designed to assess whether novices have developed the analytical skills to translate from the given problem domain to coding. In the past researchers have used instruments such as code-explain and found that the extent of cognitive depth reached in these tasks correlated well with code writing ability. However, the need for manual marking and personalized interviews used for identifying cognitive difficulties limited the study to a small group of stragglers. To extend this work to larger groups, we have devised several question types with varying cognitive demands collectively called Algorithmic Reasoning Tasks (ARTs), which do not require manual marking. These tasks require levels of reasoning which can define a learning trajectory. This paper describes these instruments and the machine learning models used for validating them. We have used the data collected in an introductory programming course in the penultimate week of the semester which required attempting ART type instruments and code writing. Our preliminary research suggests ART type instruments can be combined with specific machine learning models to act as an effective learning trajectory and early prediction of code-writing skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Existing approaches in this field often assume precise and complete observational data, neglecting the challenges associated with out-of-view objects and the noise inherent in sensor data due to limited camera range, physical obstructions, and the absence of ground truth for denoised sensor data. Such oversights are critical safety concerns, as they can result in missing essential, non-visible objects. To bridge this gap, we present a novel method for out-of-sight trajectory prediction that leverages a vision-positioning technique. Our approach denoises noisy sensor observations in an unsupervised manner and precisely maps sensor-based trajectories of out-of-sight objects into visual trajectories. This method has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in out-of-sight noisy sensor trajectory denoising and prediction on the Vi-Fi and JRDB datasets. By enhancing trajectory prediction accuracy and addressing the challenges of out-of-sight objects, our work significantly contributes to improving the safety and reliability of autonomous driving in complex environments. Our work represents the first initiative towards Out-Of-Sight Trajectory prediction (OOSTraj), setting a new benchmark for future research.

| **[Traffic State Estimation from Vehicle Trajectories with Anisotropic Gaussian Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02311v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately monitoring road traffic state is crucial for various applications, including travel time prediction, traffic control, and traffic safety. However, the lack of sensors often results in incomplete traffic state data, making it challenging to obtain reliable information for decision-making. This paper proposes a novel method for imputing traffic state data using Gaussian processes (GP) to address this issue. We propose a kernel rotation re-parametrization scheme that transforms a standard isotropic GP kernel into an anisotropic kernel, which can better model the congestion propagation in traffic flow data. The model parameters can be estimated by statistical inference using data from sparse probe vehicles or loop detectors. Moreover, the rotated GP method provides statistical uncertainty quantification for the imputed traffic state, making it more reliable. We also extend our approach to a multi-output GP, which allows for simultaneously estimating the traffic state for multiple lanes. We evaluate our method using real-world traffic data from the Next Generation simulation (NGSIM) and HighD programs, along with simulated data representing a traffic bottleneck scenario. Considering current and future mixed traffic of connected vehicles (CVs) and human-driven vehicles (HVs), we experiment with the traffic state estimation (TSE) scheme from 5% to 50% available trajectories, mimicking different CV penetration rates in a mixed traffic environment. We also test the traffic state estimation when traffic flow information is obtained from loop detectors. The results demonstrate the adaptability of our TSE method across different CV penetration rates and types of detectors, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy in scenarios with sparse observation rates.</p></details> |  |

We propose two prior attention modules, namely Kinematics Prior Attention (KPA) and Trajectory Prior Attention (TPA) to take advantage of the known anatomical structure of the human body and motion trajectory information, to facilitate effective learning of global dependencies and features in the multi-head self-attention. KPA models kinematic relationships in the human body by constructing a topology of kinematics, while TPA builds a trajectory topology to learn the information of joint motion trajectory across frames. Yielding Q, K, V vectors with prior knowledge, the two modules enable KTPFormer to model both spatial and temporal correlations simultaneously. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks (Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and HumanEva) show that KTPFormer achieves superior performance in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. More importantly, our KPA and TPA modules have lightweight plug-and-play designs and can be integrated into various transformer-based networks (i.e., diffusion-based) to improve the performance with only a very small increase in the computational overhead.

While such discrepancies can be alleviated with more complex models, this often complicates controller design and implementation. By leveraging the fact that many trajectories of interest are periodic, we show that perfect tracking is possible when incorporating a simple observer that estimates and compensates for periodic disturbances. We present the design of the observer and the accompanying tracking MPC scheme, proving that their combination achieves zero tracking error asymptotically, regardless of the complexity of the unmodelled dynamics. We validate the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating asymptotically perfect tracking on a high-dimensional soft robot with nearly 10,000 states and a fivefold reduction in tracking errors compared to a baseline MPC on small-scale autonomous race car experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, Submitted to the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2024)</p></details> |

In this paper, we address this issue by combining a deep learning-based trajectory prediction model with risk potential field-based motion planning. In order to comprehensively predict the possible future trajectories of other vehicles, we propose a target-region based trajectory prediction model(TRTP) which considers every region a vehicle may arrive in the future. After that, we construct a risk potential field at each future time step based on the prediction results of TRTP, and integrate risk value to the objective function of Model Predictive Contouring Control(MPCC). This enables the uncertainty of other vehicles to be taken into account during the planning process. Balancing between risk and progress along the reference path can achieve both driving safety and efficiency at the same time. We also demonstrate the security and effectiveness performance of our method in the CARLA simulator.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches mainly focus on developing compact neural networks to increase prediction precision on public datasets, typically employing a standardized input duration. However, a notable issue arises when these models are evaluated with varying observation lengths, leading to a significant performance drop, a phenomenon we term the Observation Length Shift. To address this issue, we introduce a general and effective framework, the FlexiLength Network (FLN), to enhance the robustness of existing trajectory prediction techniques against varying observation periods. Specifically, FLN integrates trajectory data with diverse observation lengths, incorporates FlexiLength Calibration (FLC) to acquire temporal invariant representations, and employs FlexiLength Adaptation (FLA) to further refine these representations for more accurate future trajectory predictions. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets, ie, ETH/UCY, nuScenes, and Argoverse 1, demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed FLN framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM), a generalization encompassing CM and score-based models as special cases. CTM trains a single neural network that can -- in a single forward pass -- output scores (i.e., gradients of log-density) and enables unrestricted traversal between any initial and final time along the Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) in a diffusion process. CTM enables the efficient combination of adversarial training and denoising score matching loss to enhance performance and achieves new state-of-the-art FIDs for single-step diffusion model sampling on CIFAR-10 (FID 1.73) and ImageNet at 64x64 resolution (FID 1.92). CTM also enables a new family of sampling schemes, both deterministic and stochastic, involving long jumps along the ODE solution trajectories. It consistently improves sample quality as computational budgets increase, avoiding the degradation seen in CM. Furthermore, unlike CM, CTM's access to the score function can streamline the adoption of established controllable/conditional generation methods from the diffusion community. This access also enables the computation of likelihood.

We present a method to predict human motion conditioning on the surrounding static scene. Our method leverages a diffusion model to produce a distribution of potential future trajectories, taking into account the user's observation of the environment. We introduce a compact representation to encode the user's visual memory of the surroundings, as well as an efficient sample-generating technique to speed up real-time inference of a diffusion model. We ablate our model and compare it to baselines, and results show that our model outperforms existing methods on key metrics of collision avoidance and trajectory mode coverage.</p></details> | 14 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Joint Pedestrian Trajectory Prediction through Posterior Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00237v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint pedestrian trajectory prediction has long grappled with the inherent unpredictability of human behaviors. Recent investigations employing variants of conditional diffusion models in trajectory prediction have exhibited notable success. Nevertheless, the heavy dependence on accurate historical data results in their vulnerability to noise disturbances and data incompleteness. To improve the robustness and reliability, we introduce the Guided Full Trajectory Diffuser (GFTD), a novel diffusion model framework that captures the joint full (historical and future) trajectory distribution. By learning from the full trajectory, GFTD can recover the noisy and missing data, hence improving the robustness. In addition, GFTD can adapt to data imperfections without additional training requirements, leveraging posterior sampling for reliable prediction and controllable generation. Our approach not only simplifies the prediction process but also enhances generalizability in scenarios with noise and incomplete inputs. Through rigorous experimental evaluation, GFTD exhibits superior performance in both trajectory prediction and controllable generation.</p></details> |  |

Imprecise robot kinematics and noisy observations caused by the poor visual acuity of an endoscopic camera make tool tracking challenging. Previous works in surgical automation adopt environment-specific setups or hard-coded strategies instead of explicitly considering motion and observation uncertainty of tool tracking in their policies. In this work, we present SURESTEP, an uncertainty-aware trajectory optimization framework for robust surgical automation. We model the uncertainty of tool tracking with the components motivated by the sources of noise in typical surgical scenes. Using a Gaussian assumption to propagate our uncertainty models through a given tool trajectory, SURESTEP provides a general framework that minimizes the upper bound on the entropy of the final estimated tool distribution. We compare SURESTEP with a baseline method on a real-world suture needle regrasping task under challenging environmental conditions, such as poor lighting and a moving endoscopic camera. The results over 60 regrasps on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) demonstrate that our optimized trajectories significantly outperform the un-optimized baseline.</p></details> |  |

| **[SingularTrajectory: Universal Trajectory Predictor Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18452v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are five types of trajectory prediction tasks: deterministic, stochastic, domain adaptation, momentary observation, and few-shot. These associated tasks are defined by various factors, such as the length of input paths, data split and pre-processing methods. Interestingly, even though they commonly take sequential coordinates of observations as input and infer future paths in the same coordinates as output, designing specialized architectures for each task is still necessary. For the other task, generality issues can lead to sub-optimal performances. In this paper, we propose SingularTrajectory, a diffusion-based universal trajectory prediction framework to reduce the performance gap across the five tasks. The core of SingularTrajectory is to unify a variety of human dynamics representations on the associated tasks. To do this, we first build a Singular space to project all types of motion patterns from each task into one embedding space. We next propose an adaptive anchor working in the Singular space. Unlike traditional fixed anchor methods that sometimes yield unacceptable paths, our adaptive anchor enables correct anchors, which are put into a wrong location, based on a traversability map. Finally, we adopt a diffusion-based predictor to further enhance the prototype paths using a cascaded denoising process. Our unified framework ensures the generality across various benchmark settings such as input modality, and trajectory lengths. Extensive experiments on five public benchmarks demonstrate that SingularTrajectory substantially outperforms existing models, highlighting its effectiveness in estimating general dynamics of human movements.

Language-Based Multimodal Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18447v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have demonstrated impressive ability in context understanding and generative performance. Inspired by the recent success of language foundation models, in this paper, we propose LMTraj (Language-based Multimodal Trajectory predictor), which recasts the trajectory prediction task into a sort of question-answering problem. Departing from traditional numerical regression models, which treat the trajectory coordinate sequence as continuous signals, we consider them as discrete signals like text prompts. Specially, we first transform an input space for the trajectory coordinate into the natural language space. Here, the entire time-series trajectories of pedestrians are converted into a text prompt, and scene images are described as text information through image captioning. The transformed numerical and image data are then wrapped into the question-answering template for use in a language model. Next, to guide the language model in understanding and reasoning high-level knowledge, such as scene context and social relationships between pedestrians, we introduce an auxiliary multi-task question and answering. We then train a numerical tokenizer with the prompt data. We encourage the tokenizer to separate the integer and decimal parts well, and leverage it to capture correlations between the consecutive numbers in the language model. Lastly, we train the language model using the numerical tokenizer and all of the question-answer prompts. Here, we propose a beam-search-based most-likely prediction and a temperature-based multimodal prediction to implement both deterministic and stochastic inferences. Applying our LMTraj, we show that the language-based model can be a powerful pedestrian trajectory predictor, and outperforms existing numerical-based predictor methods.

While these questions can be studied by employing multiple datasets, it is challenging due to several discrepancies, e.g., in data formats, map resolution, and semantic annotation types. To address these challenges, we introduce UniTraj, a comprehensive framework that unifies various datasets, models, and evaluation criteria, presenting new opportunities for the vehicle trajectory prediction field. In particular, using UniTraj, we conduct extensive experiments and find that model performance significantly drops when transferred to other datasets. However, enlarging data size and diversity can substantially improve performance, leading to a new state-of-the-art result for the nuScenes dataset. We provide insights into dataset characteristics to explain these findings. The code can be found here: https://github.com/vita-epfl/UniTraj</p></details> |  |
| **[World Models via Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08533v4)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>World models are a powerful tool for developing intelligent agents. By predicting the outcome of a sequence of actions, world models enable policies to be optimised via on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) using synthetic data, i.e. in "in imagination". Existing world models are autoregressive in that they interleave predicting the next state with sampling the next action from the policy. Prediction error inevitably compounds as the trajectory length grows. In this work, we propose a novel world modelling approach that is not autoregressive and generates entire on-policy trajectories in a single pass through a diffusion model. Our approach, Policy-Guided Trajectory Diffusion (PolyGRAD), leverages a denoising model in addition to the gradient of the action distribution of the policy to diffuse a trajectory of initially random states and actions into an on-policy synthetic trajectory. We analyse the connections between PolyGRAD, score-based generative models, and classifier-guided diffusion models. Our results demonstrate that PolyGRAD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of trajectory prediction error for short trajectories, with the exception of autoregressive diffusion. For short trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains similar errors to autoregressive diffusion, but with lower computational requirements. For long trajectories, PolyGRAD obtains comparable performance to baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that PolyGRAD enables performant policies to be trained via on-policy RL in imagination for MuJoCo continuous control domains. Thus, PolyGRAD introduces a new paradigm for accurate on-policy world modelling without autoregressive sampling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in TMLR, March 2024</p></details> |
| **[LC-LLM: Explainable Lane-Change Intention and Trajectory Predictions with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18344v1)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To ensure safe driving in dynamic environments, autonomous vehicles should possess the capability to accurately predict the lane change intentions of surrounding vehicles in advance and forecast their future trajectories. Existing motion prediction approaches have ample room for improvement, particularly in terms of long-term prediction accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing LC-LLM, an explainable lane change prediction model that leverages the strong reasoning capabilities and self-explanation abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Essentially, we reformulate the lane change prediction task as a language modeling problem, processing heterogeneous driving scenario information in natural language as prompts for input into the LLM and employing a supervised fine-tuning technique to tailor the LLM specifically for our lane change prediction task. This allows us to utilize the LLM's powerful common sense reasoning abilities to understand complex interactive information, thereby improving the accuracy of long-term predictions. Furthermore, we incorporate explanatory requirements into the prompts in the inference stage. Therefore, our LC-LLM model not only can predict lane change intentions and trajectories but also provides explanations for its predictions, enhancing the interpretability. Extensive experiments on the large-scale highD dataset demonstrate the superior performance and interpretability of our LC-LLM in lane change prediction task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to utilize LLMs for predicting lane change behavior. Our study shows that LLMs can encode comprehensive interaction information for driving behavior understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, existing representations for motion, such as deformation models or time-dependent neural representations, are limited in the amount of motion they can generate-they cannot synthesize motion extending far beyond the bounding box used for volume rendering. The lack of a more flexible motion model contributes to the gap in realism between 4D generation methods and recent, near-photorealistic video generation models. Here, we propose TC4D: trajectory-conditioned text-to-4D generation, which factors motion into global and local components. We represent the global motion of a scene's bounding box using rigid transformation along a trajectory parameterized by a spline. We learn local deformations that conform to the global trajectory using supervision from a text-to-video model. Our approach enables the synthesis of scenes animated along arbitrary trajectories, compositional scene generation, and significant improvements to the realism and amount of generated motion, which we evaluate qualitatively and through a user study.

| **[Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles for Multimodal Trajectory Forecasting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17678v1)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate trajectory forecasting is crucial for the performance of various systems, such as advanced driver-assistance systems and self-driving vehicles. These forecasts allow to anticipate events leading to collisions and, therefore, to mitigate them. Deep Neural Networks have excelled in motion forecasting, but issues like overconfidence and uncertainty quantification persist. Deep Ensembles address these concerns, yet applying them to multimodal distributions remains challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel approach named Hierarchical Light Transformer Ensembles (HLT-Ens), aimed at efficiently training an ensemble of Transformer architectures using a novel hierarchical loss function. HLT-Ens leverages grouped fully connected layers, inspired by grouped convolution techniques, to capture multimodal distributions, effectively. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that HLT-Ens achieves state-of-the-art performance levels, offering a promising avenue for improving trajectory forecasting techniques.</p></details> |  |

The diversity and uncertainty in socially interactive behaviors among a rich variety of agents make this task more challenging than other deterministic computer vision tasks. Researchers have made a lot of efforts to quantify the effects of these interactions on future trajectories through different mathematical models and network structures, but this problem has not been well solved. Inspired by marine animals that localize the positions of their companions underwater through echoes, we build a new anglebased trainable social interaction representation, named SocialCircle, for continuously reflecting the context of social interactions at different angular orientations relative to the target agent. We validate the effect of the proposed SocialCircle by training it along with several newly released trajectory prediction models, and experiments show that the SocialCircle not only quantitatively improves the prediction performance, but also qualitatively helps better simulate social interactions when forecasting pedestrian trajectories in a way that is consistent with human intuitions.</p></details> | CVPR 2024 accepted |

| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning: Role of State Aggregation and Trajectory Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17091v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the problem of offline reinforcement learning with value function realizability but without Bellman completeness. Previous work by Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022) left open the question whether a bounded concentrability coefficient along with trajectory-based offline data admits a polynomial sample complexity. In this work, we provide a negative answer to this question for the task of offline policy evaluation. In addition to addressing this question, we provide a rather complete picture for offline policy evaluation with only value function realizability. Our primary findings are threefold: 1) The sample complexity of offline policy evaluation is governed by the concentrability coefficient in an aggregated Markov Transition Model jointly determined by the function class and the offline data distribution, rather than that in the original MDP. This unifies and generalizes the ideas of Xie and Jiang (2021) and Foster et al. (2022), 2) The concentrability coefficient in the aggregated Markov Transition Model may grow exponentially with the horizon length, even when the concentrability coefficient in the original MDP is small and the offline data is admissible (i.e., the data distribution equals the occupancy measure of some policy), 3) Under value function realizability, there is a generic reduction that can convert any hard instance with admissible data to a hard instance with trajectory data, implying that trajectory data offers no extra benefits over admissible data. These three pieces jointly resolve the open problem, though each of them could be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trajectory Optimization with Global Yaw Parameterization for Field-of-View Constrained Autonomous Flight](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17067v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory generation for quadrotors with limited field-of-view sensors has numerous applications such as aerial exploration, coverage, inspection, videography, and target tracking. Most previous works simplify the task of optimizing yaw trajectories by either aligning the heading of the robot with its velocity, or potentially restricting the feasible space of candidate trajectories by using a limited yaw domain to circumvent angular singularities. In this paper, we propose a novel \textit{global} yaw parameterization method for trajectory optimization that allows a 360-degree yaw variation as demanded by the underlying algorithm. This approach effectively bypasses inherent singularities by including supplementary quadratic constraints and transforming the final decision variables into the desired state representation. This method significantly reduces the needed control effort, and improves optimization feasibility. Furthermore, we apply the method to several examples of different applications that require jointly optimizing over both the yaw and position trajectories. Ultimately, we present a comprehensive numerical analysis and evaluation of our proposed method in both simulation and real-world experiments.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we 1) decompose our polygonal environment into different overlapping cells 2) write out our polynomial trajectories as the output of a reference dynamical system with given initial conditions 3) formulate convergence and safety constraints as Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) on our controller using Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and 4) solve a semi-definite programming (SDP) problem with convergence and safety constraints imposed to synthesize a controller for each convex cell. Extensive simulations are included to test our motion planning method under different initial conditions and different reference trajectories. The synthesized controller is robust to changes in initial conditions and is always safe relative to the boundaries of the polygonal environment.</p></details> |  |

This paper for the first time proposes a surveillance system that utilizes low-cost magnetic sensors for detecting and tracking vehicles continuously along the road. The system uses multiple sensors mounted along the roadside and lane boundaries to capture the movement of vehicles. Real-time measurement data is collected by base stations and processed to produce vehicle trajectories that include position, timestamp, and speed. To address the challenge of tracking vehicles continuously on a road network using a large amount of unlabeled magnetic sensor measurements, we first define a vehicle trajectory tracking problem. We then propose a graph-based data association algorithm to track each detected vehicle, and design a related online algorithm framework respectively. We finally validate the performance via both experimental simulation and real-world road deployment. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution provides a cost-effective solution to capture the driving status of vehicles and on that basis form various traffic safety and efficiency applications.</p></details> |  |

As a result, many recent works have proposed methods for estimating HD maps online from sensor data, enabling AVs to operate outside of previously-mapped regions. However, current online map estimation approaches are developed in isolation of their downstream tasks, complicating their integration in AV stacks. In particular, they do not produce uncertainty or confidence estimates. In this work, we extend multiple state-of-the-art online map estimation methods to additionally estimate uncertainty and show how this enables more tightly integrating online mapping with trajectory forecasting. In doing so, we find that incorporating uncertainty yields up to 50% faster training convergence and up to 15% better prediction performance on the real-world nuScenes driving dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures, 6 tables.

Most existing works capture map information through an one-stage interaction with map by vector-based attention, to provide map constraints for social interaction and multi-modal differentiation. However, these methods have to encode all required map rules into the focal agent's feature, so as to retain all possible intentions' paths while at the meantime to adapt to potential social interaction. In this work, a progressive interaction network is proposed to enable the agent's feature to progressively focus on relevant maps, in order to better learn agents' feature representation capturing the relevant map constraints. The network progressively encode the complex influence of map constraints into the agent's feature through graph convolutions at the following three stages: after historical trajectory encoder, after social interaction, and after multi-modal differentiation. In addition, a weight allocation mechanism is proposed for multi-modal training, so that each mode can obtain learning opportunities from a single-mode ground truth. Experiments have validated the superiority of progressive interactions to the existing one-stage interaction, and demonstrate the effectiveness of each component. Encouraging results were obtained in the challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the uncertainty-aware learning procedures in probabilistic approaches lead to robust policies that are less sensitive to noisy observations compared to uncertainty unaware solutions. We propose to combine trajectory sampling and deep Gaussian covariance network (DGCN) for a data-efficient solution to MBRL problems in an optimal control setting. We compare trajectory sampling with density-based approximation for uncertainty propagation using three different probabilistic world models; Gaussian processes, Bayesian neural networks, and DGCNs. We provide empirical evidence using four different well-known test environments, that our method improves the sample-efficiency over other combinations of uncertainty propagation methods and probabilistic models.

As a part of ITS, Vehicle Trajectory Prediction (VTP) aims to forecast a vehicle's future positions based on its past and current movements. VTP is a pivotal element for road safety, aiding in applications such as traffic management, accident prevention, work-zone safety, and energy optimization. While most works in this field focus on autonomous driving, with the growing number of surveillance cameras, another sub-field emerges for surveillance VTP with its own set of challenges. In this paper, we introduce VT-Former, a novel transformer-based VTP approach for highway safety and surveillance.

In recent years, emerging data-driven deep learning-based methods have shown great promise for these two tasks in learning various traffic scenarios and improving average performance without assuming physical models. However, it remains a challenging problem for these methods to ensure that the generated/predicted trajectories are physically realistic. This challenge arises because learning-based approaches often function as opaque black boxes and do not adhere to physical laws. Conversely, existing model-based methods provide physically feasible results but are constrained by predefined model structures, limiting their capabilities to address complex scenarios. To address the limitations of these two types of approaches, we propose a new method that integrates kinematic knowledge into neural stochastic differential equations (SDE) and designs a variational autoencoder based on this latent kinematics-aware SDE (LK-SDE) to generate vehicle motions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms both model-based and learning-based baselines in producing physically realistic and precisely controllable vehicle trajectories.

| **[Trajectory Regularization Enhances Self-Supervised Geometric Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14973v1)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has proven effective in learning high-quality representations for various downstream tasks, with a primary focus on semantic tasks. However, its application in geometric tasks remains underexplored, partially due to the absence of a standardized evaluation method for geometric representations. To address this gap, we introduce a new pose-estimation benchmark for assessing SSL geometric representations, which demands training without semantic or pose labels and achieving proficiency in both semantic and geometric downstream tasks. On this benchmark, we study enhancing SSL geometric representations without sacrificing semantic classification accuracy. We find that leveraging mid-layer representations improves pose-estimation performance by 10-20%. Further, we introduce an unsupervised trajectory-regularization loss, which improves performance by an additional 4% and improves generalization ability on out-of-distribution data. We hope the proposed benchmark and methods offer new insights and improvements in self-supervised geometric representation learning.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, focusing on simplistic spatio-temporal features, face challenges of complex calculations, limited scalability, and inadequate adaptability to real-world complexities. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the development and recent advances in deep learning for trajectory computing (DL4Traj). We first define trajectory data and provide a brief overview of widely-used deep learning models. Systematically, we explore deep learning applications in trajectory management (pre-processing, storage, analysis, and visualization) and mining (trajectory-related forecasting, trajectory-related recommendation, trajectory classification, travel time estimation, anomaly detection, and mobility generation). Notably, we encapsulate recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) that hold the potential to augment trajectory computing. Additionally, we summarize application scenarios, public datasets, and toolkits. Finally, we outline current challenges in DL4Traj research and propose future directions.

| **[A Physics Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) Framework for Vehicle Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15284v2)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In vehicle trajectory prediction, physics models and data-driven models are two predominant methodologies. However, each approach presents its own set of challenges: physics models fall short in predictability, while data-driven models lack interpretability. Addressing these identified shortcomings, this paper proposes a novel framework, the Physics-Enhanced Residual Learning (PERL) model. PERL integrates the strengths of physics-based and data-driven methods for traffic state prediction. PERL contains a physics model and a residual learning model. Its prediction is the sum of the physics model result and a predicted residual as a correction to it. It preserves the interpretability inherent to physics-based models and has reduced data requirements compared to data-driven methods. Experiments were conducted using a real-world vehicle trajectory dataset. We proposed a PERL model, with the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) as its physics car-following model and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as its residual learning model. We compare this PERL model with the physics car-following model, data-driven model, and other physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The result reveals that PERL achieves better prediction with a small dataset, compared to the physics model, data-driven model, and PINN model. Second, the PERL model showed faster convergence during training, offering comparable performance with fewer training samples than the data-driven model and PINN model. Sensitivity analysis also proves comparable performance of PERL using another residual learning model and a physics car-following model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certified Human Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13778v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction plays an essential role in autonomous vehicles. While numerous strategies have been developed to enhance the robustness of trajectory prediction models, these methods are predominantly heuristic and do not offer guaranteed robustness against adversarial attacks and noisy observations. In this work, we propose a certification approach tailored for the task of trajectory prediction. To this end, we address the inherent challenges associated with trajectory prediction, including unbounded outputs, and mutli-modality, resulting in a model that provides guaranteed robustness. Furthermore, we integrate a denoiser into our method to further improve the performance. Through comprehensive evaluations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique across various baselines and using standard trajectory prediction datasets.

Motivated by the pivotal role trajectory length plays in the training process, we introduce Ada-NAV, a novel adaptive trajectory length scheme designed to enhance the training sample efficiency of RL algorithms in robotic navigation tasks. Unlike traditional approaches that treat trajectory length as a fixed hyperparameter, we propose to dynamically adjust it based on the entropy of the underlying navigation policy. Interestingly, Ada-NAV can be applied to both existing on-policy and off-policy RL methods, which we demonstrate by empirically validating its efficacy on three popular RL methods: REINFORCE, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC). We demonstrate through simulated and real-world robotic experiments that Ada-NAV outperforms conventional methods that employ constant or randomly sampled trajectory lengths. Specifically, for a fixed sample budget, Ada-NAV achieves an 18\% increase in navigation success rate, a 20-38\% reduction in navigation path length, and a 9.32\% decrease in elevation costs. Furthermore, we showcase the versatility of Ada-NAV by integrating it with the Clearpath Husky robot, illustrating its applicability in complex outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Progressive trajectory matching for medical dataset distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13469v1)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is essential but challenging to share medical image datasets due to privacy issues, which prohibit building foundation models and knowledge transfer. In this paper, we propose a novel dataset distillation method to condense the original medical image datasets into a synthetic one that preserves useful information for building an analysis model without accessing the original datasets. Existing methods tackle only natural images by randomly matching parts of the training trajectories of the model parameters trained by the whole real datasets. However, through extensive experiments on medical image datasets, the training process is extremely unstable and achieves inferior distillation results. To solve these barriers, we propose to design a novel progressive trajectory matching strategy to improve the training stability for medical image dataset distillation. Additionally, it is observed that improved stability prevents the synthetic dataset diversity and final performance improvements. Therefore, we propose a dynamic overlap mitigation module that improves the synthetic dataset diversity by dynamically eliminating the overlap across different images and retraining parts of the synthetic images for better convergence. Finally, we propose a new medical image dataset distillation benchmark of various modalities and configurations to promote fair evaluations. It is validated that our proposed method achieves 8.33% improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average, and 11.7% improvement when ipc=2 (i.e., image per class is 2). Codes and benchmarks will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[A novel methodological framework for the analysis of health trajectories and survival outcomes in heart failure patients](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03138v2)** | 2024-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heart failure (HF) contributes to circa 200,000 annual hospitalizations in France. With the increasing age of HF patients, elucidating the specific causes of inpatient mortality became a public health problematic. We introduce a novel methodological framework designed to identify prevalent health trajectories and investigate their impact on death. The initial step involves applying sequential pattern mining to characterize patients' trajectories, followed by an unsupervised clustering algorithm based on a new metric for measuring the distance between hospitalization diagnoses. Finally, a survival analysis is conducted to assess survival outcomes. The application of this framework to HF patients from a representative sample of the French population demonstrates its methodological significance in enhancing the analysis of healthcare trajectories.</p></details> |  |

Despite its advantages, a significant challenge within simulation-based testing is the generation of safety-critical scenarios, which are essential to ensure that AVs can handle rare but potentially fatal situations. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel generative framework, CaDRE, which is specifically designed for generating diverse and controllable safety-critical scenarios using real-world trajectories. Our approach optimizes for both the quality and diversity of scenarios by employing a unique formulation and algorithm that integrates real-world data, domain knowledge, and black-box optimization techniques. We validate the effectiveness of our framework through extensive testing in three representative types of traffic scenarios. The results demonstrate superior performance in generating diverse and high-quality scenarios with greater sample efficiency than existing reinforcement learning and sampling-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Flow Matching: Learning Straight Trajectories in Just One Step](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13117v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the several recent years, there has been a boom in development of flow matching methods for generative modeling. One intriguing property pursued by the community is the ability to learn flows with straight trajectories which realize the optimal transport (OT) displacements. Straightness is crucial for fast integration of the learned flow's paths. Unfortunately, most existing flow straightening methods are based on non-trivial iterative procedures which accumulate the error during training or exploit heuristic minibatch OT approximations. To address this issue, we develop a novel optimal flow matching approach which recovers the straight OT displacement for the quadratic cost in just one flow matching step.</p></details> |  |
| **[D-Cubed: Latent Diffusion Trajectory Optimisation for Dexterous Deformable Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12861v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mastering dexterous robotic manipulation of deformable objects is vital for overcoming the limitations of parallel grippers in real-world applications. Current trajectory optimisation approaches often struggle to solve such tasks due to the large search space and the limited task information available from a cost function. In this work, we propose D-Cubed, a novel trajectory optimisation method using a latent diffusion model (LDM) trained from a task-agnostic play dataset to solve dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks. D-Cubed learns a skill-latent space that encodes short-horizon actions in the play dataset using a VAE and trains a LDM to compose the skill latents into a skill trajectory, representing a long-horizon action trajectory in the dataset. To optimise a trajectory for a target task, we introduce a novel gradient-free guided sampling method that employs the Cross-Entropy method within the reverse diffusion process. In particular, D-Cubed samples a small number of noisy skill trajectories using the LDM for exploration and evaluates the trajectories in simulation. Then, D-Cubed selects the trajectory with the lowest cost for the subsequent reverse process. This effectively explores promising solution areas and optimises the sampled trajectories towards a target task throughout the reverse diffusion process. Through empirical evaluation on a public benchmark of dexterous deformable object manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that D-Cubed outperforms traditional trajectory optimisation and competitive baseline approaches by a significant margin. We further demonstrate that trajectories found by D-Cubed readily transfer to a real-world LEAP hand on a folding task.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://applied-ai-lab.github.io/D-cubed/</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12510v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applied tasks such as image editing and restoration. The success of diffusion models lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. Thus, this work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.

| **[Boosting Transferability in Vision-Language Attacks via Diversification along the Intersection Region of Adversarial Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12445v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models exhibit remarkable capabilities in comprehending both images and text, yet they remain susceptible to multimodal adversarial examples (AEs). Strengthening adversarial attacks and uncovering vulnerabilities, especially common issues in VLP models (e.g., high transferable AEs), can stimulate further research on constructing reliable and practical VLP models. A recent work (i.e., Set-level guidance attack) indicates that augmenting image-text pairs to increase AE diversity along the optimization path enhances the transferability of adversarial examples significantly. However, this approach predominantly emphasizes diversity around the online adversarial examples (i.e., AEs in the optimization period), leading to the risk of overfitting the victim model and affecting the transferability. In this study, we posit that the diversity of adversarial examples towards the clean input and online AEs are both pivotal for enhancing transferability across VLP models. Consequently, we propose using diversification along the intersection region of adversarial trajectory to expand the diversity of AEs. To fully leverage the interaction between modalities, we introduce text-guided adversarial example selection during optimization. Furthermore, to further mitigate the potential overfitting, we direct the adversarial text deviating from the last intersection region along the optimization path, rather than adversarial images as in existing methods. Extensive experiments affirm the effectiveness of our method in improving transferability across various VLP models and downstream vision-and-language tasks (e.g., Image-Text Retrieval(ITR), Visual Grounding(VG), Image Captioning(IC)).</p></details> |  |

The vehicle moves with unit speed and the laser, having a finite range, can rotate in a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction with a bounded angular rate. From an arbitrary initial position and orientation, the objective is to steer the system so that a given static target is within the range of the laser and the laser is oriented at it in minimum time. We characterize multiple properties of the optimal trajectory and establish that the optimal trajectory for the Dubins-laser system is one out of a total of 16 candidates. Finally, we provide numerical insights that illustrate the properties characterized in this work.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Gain Disturbance Observer for Robust Trajectory Tracking of Quadrotors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19115v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a simple method to boost the robustness of quadrotors in trajectory tracking. The presented method features a high-gain disturbance observer (HGDO) that provides disturbance estimates in real-time. The estimates are then used in a trajectory control law to compensate for disturbance effects. We present theoretical convergence results showing that the proposed HGDO can quickly converge to an adjustable neighborhood of actual disturbance values. We will then integrate the disturbance estimates with a typical robust trajectory controller, namely sliding mode control (SMC), and present Lyapunov stability analysis to establish the boundedness of trajectory tracking errors. However, our stability analysis can be easily extended to other Lyapunov-based controllers to develop different HGDO-based controllers with formal stability guarantees. We evaluate the proposed HGDO-based control method using both simulation and laboratory experiments in various scenarios and in the presence of external disturbances. Our results indicate that the addition of HGDO to a quadrotor trajectory controller can significantly improve the accuracy and precision of trajectory tracking in the presence of external disturbances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reachability-based Trajectory Design via Exact Formulation of Implicit Neural Signed Distance Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12280v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating receding-horizon motion trajectories for autonomous vehicles in real-time while also providing safety guarantees is challenging. This is because a future trajectory needs to be planned before the previously computed trajectory is completely executed. This becomes even more difficult if the trajectory is required to satisfy continuous-time collision-avoidance constraints while accounting for a large number of obstacles. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel real-time, receding-horizon motion planning algorithm named REachability-based trajectory Design via Exact Formulation of Implicit NEural signed Distance functions (REDEFINED). REDEFINED first applies offline reachability analysis to compute zonotope-based reachable sets that overapproximate the motion of the ego vehicle. During online planning, REDEFINED leverages zonotope arithmetic to construct a neural implicit representation that computes the exact signed distance between a parameterized swept volume of the ego vehicle and obstacle vehicles. REDEFINED then implements a novel, real-time optimization framework that utilizes the neural network to construct a collision avoidance constraint. REDEFINED is compared to a variety of state-of-the-art techniques and is demonstrated to successfully enable the vehicle to safely navigate through complex environments. Code, data, and video demonstrations can be found at https://roahmlab.github.io/redefined/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Informed Spectral Normalized Gaussian Processes for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11966v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior parameter distributions provide an elegant way to represent prior expert and world knowledge for informed learning. Previous work has shown that using such informative priors to regularize probabilistic deep learning (DL) models increases their performance and data-efficiency. However, commonly used sampling-based approximations for probabilistic DL models can be computationally expensive, requiring multiple inference passes and longer training times. Promising alternatives are compute-efficient last layer kernel approximations like spectral normalized Gaussian processes (SNGPs). We propose a novel regularization-based continual learning method for SNGPs, which enables the use of informative priors that represent prior knowledge learned from previous tasks. Our proposal builds upon well-established methods and requires no rehearsal memory or parameter expansion. We apply our informed SNGP model to the trajectory prediction problem in autonomous driving by integrating prior drivability knowledge. On two public datasets, we investigate its performance under diminishing training data and across locations, and thereby demonstrate an increase in data-efficiency and robustness to location-transfers over non-informed and informed baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[TCNet: Continuous Sign Language Recognition from Trajectories and Correlated Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11818v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in continuous sign language recognition (CSLR) is to efficiently capture long-range spatial interactions over time from the video input. To address this challenge, we propose TCNet, a hybrid network that effectively models spatio-temporal information from Trajectories and Correlated regions. TCNet's trajectory module transforms frames into aligned trajectories composed of continuous visual tokens. In addition, for a query token, self-attention is learned along the trajectory. As such, our network can also focus on fine-grained spatio-temporal patterns, such as finger movements, of a specific region in motion. TCNet's correlation module uses a novel dynamic attention mechanism that filters out irrelevant frame regions. Additionally, it assigns dynamic key-value tokens from correlated regions to each query. Both innovations significantly reduce the computation cost and memory. We perform experiments on four large-scale datasets: PHOENIX14, PHOENIX14-T, CSL, and CSL-Daily, respectively. Our results demonstrate that TCNet consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance. For example, we improve over the previous state-of-the-art by 1.5% and 1.0% word error rate on PHOENIX14 and PHOENIX14-T, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Generative models canbe used to augment real-world datasets with generated data toproduce edge case scenarios by sampling in a learned latentspace. Autoencoders can learn said latent representation for aspecific domain by learning to reconstruct the input data froma lower-dimensional intermediate representation. However, theresulting trajectories are not necessarily physically plausible, butinstead typically contain noise that is not present in the inputtrajectory. To resolve this issue, we propose the novel Physics-Informed Trajectory Autoencoder (PITA) architecture, whichincorporates a physical dynamics model into the loss functionof the autoencoder. This results in smooth trajectories that notonly reconstruct the input trajectory but also adhere to thephysical model. We evaluate PITA on a real-world dataset ofvehicle trajectories and compare its performance to a normalautoencoder and a state-of-the-art action-space autoencoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrajectoryNAS: A Neural Architecture Search for Trajectory Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11695v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems are a rapidly evolving technology that enables driverless car production. Trajectory prediction is a critical component of autonomous driving systems, enabling cars to anticipate the movements of surrounding objects for safe navigation. Trajectory prediction using Lidar point-cloud data performs better than 2D images due to providing 3D information. However, processing point-cloud data is more complicated and time-consuming than 2D images. Hence, state-of-the-art 3D trajectory predictions using point-cloud data suffer from slow and erroneous predictions. This paper introduces TrajectoryNAS, a pioneering method that focuses on utilizing point cloud data for trajectory prediction. By leveraging Neural Architecture Search (NAS), TrajectoryNAS automates the design of trajectory prediction models, encompassing object detection, tracking, and forecasting in a cohesive manner. This approach not only addresses the complex interdependencies among these tasks but also emphasizes the importance of accuracy and efficiency in trajectory modeling. Through empirical studies, TrajectoryNAS demonstrates its effectiveness in enhancing the performance of autonomous driving systems, marking a significant advancement in the field.Experimental results reveal that TrajcetoryNAS yield a minimum of 4.8 higger accuracy and 1.1* lower latency over competing methods on the NuScenes dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Lossless Dataset Distillation via Difficulty-Aligned Trajectory Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05773v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ultimate goal of Dataset Distillation is to synthesize a small synthetic dataset such that a model trained on this synthetic set will perform equally well as a model trained on the full, real dataset. Until now, no method of Dataset Distillation has reached this completely lossless goal, in part due to the fact that previous methods only remain effective when the total number of synthetic samples is extremely small. Since only so much information can be contained in such a small number of samples, it seems that to achieve truly loss dataset distillation, we must develop a distillation method that remains effective as the size of the synthetic dataset grows. In this work, we present such an algorithm and elucidate why existing methods fail to generate larger, high-quality synthetic sets. Current state-of-the-art methods rely on trajectory-matching, or optimizing the synthetic data to induce similar long-term training dynamics as the real data. We empirically find that the training stage of the trajectories we choose to match (i.e., early or late) greatly affects the effectiveness of the distilled dataset. Specifically, early trajectories (where the teacher network learns easy patterns) work well for a low-cardinality synthetic set since there are fewer examples wherein to distribute the necessary information. Conversely, late trajectories (where the teacher network learns hard patterns) provide better signals for larger synthetic sets since there are now enough samples to represent the necessary complex patterns. Based on our findings, we propose to align the difficulty of the generated patterns with the size of the synthetic dataset. In doing so, we successfully scale trajectory matching-based methods to larger synthetic datasets, achieving lossless dataset distillation for the very first time. Code and distilled datasets are available at https://gzyaftermath.github.io/DATM.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First lossless dataset distillation method, accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, a diffusion-based generative model for multi-agent trajectory prediction is proposed. The model is capable of capturing the complex interactions between traffic participants and the environment, accurately learning the multimodal nature of the data. The effectiveness of the approach is assessed on large-scale datasets of real-world traffic scenarios, showing that our model outperforms several well-established methods in terms of prediction accuracy. By the incorporation of differential motion constraints on the model output, we illustrate that our model is capable of generating a diverse set of realistic future trajectories. Through the use of an interaction-aware guidance signal, we further demonstrate that the model can be adapted to predict the behavior of less cooperative agents, emphasizing its practical applicability under uncertain traffic conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeTO: Learning Constrained Visuomotor Policy with Differentiable Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17500v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces LeTO, a method for learning constrained visuomotor policy via differentiable trajectory optimization. Our approach uniquely integrates a differentiable optimization layer into the neural network. By formulating the optimization layer as a trajectory optimization problem, we enable the model to end-to-end generate actions in a safe and controlled fashion without extra modules. Our method allows for the introduction of constraints information during the training process, thereby balancing the training objectives of satisfying constraints, smoothing the trajectories, and minimizing errors with demonstrations. This "gray box" method marries the optimization-based safety and interpretability with the powerful representational abilities of neural networks. We quantitatively evaluate LeTO in simulation and on the real robot. In simulation, LeTO achieves a success rate comparable to state-of-the-art imitation learning methods, but the generated trajectories are of less uncertainty, higher quality, and smoother. In real-world experiments, we deployed LeTO to handle constraints-critical tasks. The results show the effectiveness of LeTO comparing with state-of-the-art imitation learning approaches. We release our code at https://github.com/ZhengtongXu/LeTO.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Variational Sampling of Temporal Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11418v1)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A deterministic temporal process can be determined by its trajectory, an element in the product space of (a) initial condition $z_0 \in \mathcal{Z}$ and (b) transition function $f: (\mathcal{Z}, \mathcal{T}) \to \mathcal{Z}$ often influenced by the control of the underlying dynamical system. Existing methods often model the transition function as a differential equation or as a recurrent neural network. Despite their effectiveness in predicting future measurements, few results have successfully established a method for sampling and statistical inference of trajectories using neural networks, partially due to constraints in the parameterization. In this work, we introduce a mechanism to learn the distribution of trajectories by parameterizing the transition function $f$ explicitly as an element in a function space. Our framework allows efficient synthesis of novel trajectories, while also directly providing a convenient tool for inference, i.e., uncertainty estimation, likelihood evaluations and out of distribution detection for abnormal trajectories. These capabilities can have implications for various downstream tasks, e.g., simulation and evaluation for reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pioneering SE(2)-Equivariant Trajectory Planning for Automated Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11304v1)** | 2024-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planning the trajectory of the controlled ego vehicle is a key challenge in automated driving. As for human drivers, predicting the motions of surrounding vehicles is important to plan the own actions. Recent motion prediction methods utilize equivariant neural networks to exploit geometric symmetries in the scene. However, no existing method combines motion prediction and trajectory planning in a joint step while guaranteeing equivariance under roto-translations of the input space. We address this gap by proposing a lightweight equivariant planning model that generates multi-modal joint predictions for all vehicles and selects one mode as the ego plan. The equivariant network design improves sample efficiency, guarantees output stability, and reduces model parameters. We further propose equivariant route attraction to guide the ego vehicle along a high-level route provided by an off-the-shelf GPS navigation system. This module creates a momentum from embedded vehicle positions toward the route in latent space while keeping the equivariance property. Route attraction enables goal-oriented behavior without forcing the vehicle to stick to the exact route. We conduct experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset to investigate the capability of our planner. The results show that the planned trajectory is stable under roto-translations of the input scene which demonstrates the equivariance of our model. Despite using only a small split of the dataset for training, our method improves L2 distance at 3 s by 20.6 % and surpasses the state of the art.</p></details> |  |
| **[PINSAT: Parallelized Interleaving of Graph Search and Trajectory Optimization for Kinodynamic Motion Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08948v2)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory optimization is a widely used technique in robot motion planning for letting the dynamics and constraints on the system shape and synthesize complex behaviors. Several previous works have shown its benefits in high-dimensional continuous state spaces and under differential constraints. However, long time horizons and planning around obstacles in non-convex spaces pose challenges in guaranteeing convergence or finding optimal solutions. As a result, discrete graph search planners and sampling-based planers are preferred when facing obstacle-cluttered environments. A recently developed algorithm called INSAT effectively combines graph search in the low-dimensional subspace and trajectory optimization in the full-dimensional space for global kinodynamic planning over long horizons. Although INSAT successfully reasoned about and solved complex planning problems, the numerous expensive calls to an optimizer resulted in large planning times, thereby limiting its practical use. Inspired by the recent work on edge-based parallel graph search, we present PINSAT, which introduces systematic parallelization in INSAT to achieve lower planning times and higher success rates, while maintaining significantly lower costs over relevant baselines. We demonstrate PINSAT by evaluating it on 6 DoF kinodynamic manipulation planning with obstacles.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Efficient Trajectory Forecasting and Generation with Conditional Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10809v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction and generation are vital for autonomous robots navigating dynamic environments. While prior research has typically focused on either prediction or generation, our approach unifies these tasks to provide a versatile framework and achieve state-of-the-art performance. Diffusion models, which are currently state-of-the-art for learned trajectory generation in long-horizon planning and offline reinforcement learning tasks, rely on a computationally intensive iterative sampling process. This slow process impedes the dynamic capabilities of robotic systems. In contrast, we introduce Trajectory Conditional Flow Matching (T-CFM), a novel data-driven approach that utilizes flow matching techniques to learn a solver time-varying vector field for efficient and fast trajectory generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of T-CFM on three separate tasks: adversarial tracking, real-world aircraft trajectory forecasting, and long-horizon planning. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with an increase of 35% in predictive accuracy and 142% increase in planning performance. Notably, T-CFM achieves up to 100$\times$ speed-up compared to diffusion-based models without sacrificing accuracy, which is crucial for real-time decision making in robotics.</p></details> |  |
| **[iDb-RRT: Sampling-based Kinodynamic Motion Planning with Motion Primitives and Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10745v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT) and its variations have emerged as a robust and efficient tool for finding collision-free paths in robotic systems. However, adding dynamic constraints makes the motion planning problem significantly harder, as it requires solving two-value boundary problems (computationally expensive) or propagating random control inputs (uninformative). Alternatively, Iterative Discontinuity Bounded A* (iDb-A*), introduced in our previous study, combines search and optimization iteratively. The search step connects short trajectories (motion primitives) while allowing a bounded discontinuity between the motion primitives, which is later repaired in the trajectory optimization step. Building upon these foundations, in this paper, we present iDb-RRT, a sampling-based kinodynamic motion planning algorithm that combines motion primitives and trajectory optimization within the RRT framework. iDb-RRT is probabilistically complete and can be implemented in forward or bidirectional mode. We have tested our algorithm across a benchmark suite comprising 30 problems, spanning 8 different systems, and shown that iDb-RRT can find solutions up to 10x faster than previous methods, especially in complex scenarios that require long trajectories or involve navigating through narrow passages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, submitted to IROS 2024</p></details> |

The $\mu$-Parameterization ($\mu$P) offers a potential solution to these challenges, yielding scaling rules for model initialization and learning rates, and reportedly enabling zero-shot hyperparameter transfer from small to large models in a variety of cases. Despite the evident promise, the $\mu$P scaling rules are not yet widely adopted, perhaps due to higher implementation complexity, many variations, or complex theoretical background. This work investigates $\mu$P empirically, focusing on the ubiquitous transformer architecture, and aims to answer a simple question: does $\mu$-Transfer yield optimal learning rates in practice? From models with 2M to 10B parameters, we show that $\mu$-Transfer works as intended for the majority of important cases, but also identify some surprising cases where it may not.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, existing LLM-based large multimodal models (e.g., Video-LLaMA, VideoChat) can only take in a limited number of frames for short video understanding. In this study, we mainly focus on designing an efficient and effective model for long-term video understanding. Instead of trying to process more frames simultaneously like most existing work, we propose to process videos in an online manner and store past video information in a memory bank. This allows our model to reference historical video content for long-term analysis without exceeding LLMs' context length constraints or GPU memory limits. Our memory bank can be seamlessly integrated into current multimodal LLMs in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as long-video understanding, video question answering, and video captioning, and our model can achieve state-of-the-art performances across multiple datasets.

This strategic composition facilitates the model's exceptional proficiency in understanding and processing Chinese, a capability further enhanced through alignment techniques. Demonstrating remarkable performance on the CHC-Bench, CT-LLM excels in Chinese language tasks, and showcases its adeptness in English through SFT. This research challenges the prevailing paradigm of training LLMs predominantly on English corpora and then adapting them to other languages, broadening the horizons for LLM training methodologies. By open-sourcing the full process of training a Chinese LLM, including a detailed data processing procedure with the obtained Massive Appropriate Pretraining Chinese Corpus (MAP-CC), a well-chosen multidisciplinary Chinese Hard Case Benchmark (CHC-Bench), and the 2B-size Chinese Tiny LLM (CT-LLM), we aim to foster further exploration and innovation in both academia and industry, paving the way for more inclusive and versatile language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AnchorAL: Computationally Efficient Active Learning for Large and Imbalanced Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05623v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning for imbalanced classification tasks is challenging as the minority classes naturally occur rarely. Gathering a large pool of unlabelled data is thus essential to capture minority instances. Standard pool-based active learning is computationally expensive on large pools and often reaches low accuracy by overfitting the initial decision boundary, thus failing to explore the input space and find minority instances. To address these issues we propose AnchorAL. At each iteration, AnchorAL chooses class-specific instances from the labelled set, or anchors, and retrieves the most similar unlabelled instances from the pool. This resulting subpool is then used for active learning. Using a small, fixed-sized subpool AnchorAL allows scaling any active learning strategy to large pools. By dynamically selecting different anchors at each iteration it promotes class balance and prevents overfitting the initial decision boundary, thus promoting the discovery of new clusters of minority instances. Experiments across different classification tasks, active learning strategies, and model architectures AnchorAL is (i) faster, often reducing runtime from hours to minutes, (ii) trains more performant models, (iii) and returns more balanced datasets than competing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the NAACL 2024 Conference (main)</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Traffic Flow Prediction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02937v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic flow prediction is crucial for urban planning, transportation management, and infrastructure development. However, achieving both accuracy and interpretability in prediction models remains challenging due to the complexity of traffic data and the inherent opacity of deep learning methodologies. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Traffic Flow Prediction LLM (TF-LLM), which leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable traffic flow predictions. By transferring multi-modal traffic data into natural language descriptions, TF-LLM captures complex spatial-temporal patterns and external factors such as weather conditions, Points of Interest (PoIs), date, and holidays. We fine-tune the LLM framework using language-based instructions to align with spatial-temporal traffic flow data. Our comprehensive multi-modal traffic flow dataset (CATraffic) in California enables the evaluation of TF-LLM against state-of-the-art deep learning baselines. Results demonstrate TF-LLM's competitive accuracy while providing intuitive and interpretable predictions. We discuss the spatial-temporal and input dependencies for explainable future flow forecasting, showcasing TF-LLM's potential for diverse city prediction tasks. This paper contributes to advancing explainable traffic prediction models and lays a foundation for future exploration of LLM applications in transportation.</p></details> | 25pages, 8 figures |

However, while impressive, the required quality bar for medical applications remains far from being achieved. Currently, LLMs remain challenged by outdated knowledge and by their tendency to generate hallucinated content. Furthermore, most benchmarks to assess medical knowledge lack reference gold explanations which means that it is not possible to evaluate the reasoning of LLMs predictions. Finally, the situation is particularly grim if we consider benchmarking LLMs for languages other than English which remains, as far as we know, a totally neglected topic. In order to address these shortcomings, in this paper we present MedExpQA, the first multilingual benchmark based on medical exams to evaluate LLMs in Medical Question Answering. To the best of our knowledge, MedExpQA includes for the first time reference gold explanations written by medical doctors which can be leveraged to establish various gold-based upper-bounds for comparison with LLMs performance. Comprehensive multilingual experimentation using both the gold reference explanations and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches show that performance of LLMs still has large room for improvement, especially for languages other than English. Furthermore, and despite using state-of-the-art RAG methods, our results also demonstrate the difficulty of obtaining and integrating readily available medical knowledge that may positively impact results on downstream evaluations for Medical Question Answering. So far the benchmark is available in four languages, but we hope that this work may encourage further development to other languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Interventional Reasoning Capabilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05545v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Numerous decision-making tasks require estimating causal effects under interventions on different parts of a system. As practitioners consider using large language models (LLMs) to automate decisions, studying their causal reasoning capabilities becomes crucial. A recent line of work evaluates LLMs ability to retrieve commonsense causal facts, but these evaluations do not sufficiently assess how LLMs reason about interventions. Motivated by the role that interventions play in causal inference, in this paper, we conduct empirical analyses to evaluate whether LLMs can accurately update their knowledge of a data-generating process in response to an intervention. We create benchmarks that span diverse causal graphs (e.g., confounding, mediation) and variable types, and enable a study of intervention-based reasoning. These benchmarks allow us to isolate the ability of LLMs to accurately predict changes resulting from their ability to memorize facts or find other shortcuts. Our analysis on four LLMs highlights that while GPT- 4 models show promising accuracy at predicting the intervention effects, they remain sensitive to distracting factors in the prompts.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Since generating a semantically consistent text requires a form of effective memory, we investigate the memory properties of LLMs and find surprising similarities with key characteristics of human memory. We argue that the human-like memory properties of the Large Language Model do not follow automatically from the LLM architecture but are rather learned from the statistics of the training textual data. These results strongly suggest that the biological features of human memory leave an imprint on the way that we structure our textual narratives.</p></details> | <details><summary>13+3 ...</summary><p>13+3 pages; v2: abstract expanded and future research directions added; v3: minor clarifications added</p></details> |

In this approach, the user-provided input is free form textual requirements, which are first translated to Ecore model instance representation using an LLM, which is afterwards checked for consistency using Object Constraint Language (OCL) rules. After successful consistency check, the model instance is fed as input to another LLM for the purpose of code generation. The generated code is evaluated in a simulated environment using CARLA simulator connected to an example centralized vehicle architecture, in an emergency brake scenario.</p></details> |  |

By utilizing coroutine-based content generation constraints through a pre-agreed context-free grammar (CFG), LLMs are directed during decoding to produce formal language compliant outputs. This enhances stability and consistency in generating target data structures, types, or instructions, reducing application development complexities. Experimentally, error rates of GPT-2 and Gemma exceed 95% for DSLs longer than 36 and 282 tokens, respectively. We introduce YieldLang, a coroutine-based DSL generation framework, and evaluate it with LLMs on various tasks including JSON and Mermaid flowchart generation. Compared to benchmarks, our approach improves accuracy by 1.09 to 11.6 times, with LLMs requiring only about 16.5% of the samples to generate JSON effectively. This enhances usability of LLM-generated content for computer programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>44 pa...</summary><p>44 pages, 39 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Process Modeling With Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07541v2)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of Business Process Management (BPM), process modeling plays a crucial role in translating complex process dynamics into comprehensible visual representations, facilitating the understanding, analysis, improvement, and automation of organizational processes. Traditional process modeling methods often require extensive expertise and can be time-consuming. This paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into process modeling to enhance the accessibility of process modeling, offering a more intuitive entry point for non-experts while augmenting the efficiency of experts. We propose a framework that leverages LLMs for the automated generation and iterative refinement of process models starting from textual descriptions. Our framework involves innovative prompting strategies for effective LLM utilization, along with a secure model generation protocol and an error-handling mechanism. Moreover, we instantiate a concrete system extending our framework. This system provides robust quality guarantees on the models generated and supports exporting them in standard modeling notations, such as the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and Petri nets. Preliminary results demonstrate the framework's ability to streamline process modeling tasks, underscoring the transformative potential of generative AI in the BPM field.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoT: Enhancing Large Language Models with Reflection on Search Trees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05449v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capability in reasoning and planning when integrated with tree-search-based prompting methods. However, since these methods ignore the previous search experiences, they often make the same mistakes in the search process. To address this issue, we introduce Reflection on search Trees (RoT), an LLM reflection framework designed to improve the performance of tree-search-based prompting methods. It uses a strong LLM to summarize guidelines from previous tree search experiences to enhance the ability of a weak LLM. The guidelines are instructions about solving this task through tree search which can prevent the weak LLMs from making similar mistakes in the past search process. In addition, we proposed a novel state selection method, which identifies the critical information from historical search processes to help RoT generate more specific and meaningful guidelines. In our extensive experiments, we find that RoT significantly improves the performance of LLMs in reasoning or planning tasks with various tree-search-based prompting methods (e.g., BFS and MCTS). Non-tree-search-based prompting methods such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) can also benefit from RoT guidelines since RoT can provide task-specific knowledge collected from the search experience.</p></details> | 9 pages main |
| **[Relation Extraction Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Acupuncture Point Locations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05415v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In acupuncture therapy, the accurate location of acupoints is essential for its effectiveness. The advanced language understanding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) present a significant opportunity for extracting relations related to acupoint locations from textual knowledge sources. This study aims to compare the performance of GPT with traditional deep learning models (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers for Biomedical Text Mining (BioBERT)) in extracting acupoint-related location relations and assess the impact of pretraining and fine-tuning on GPT's performance. We utilized the World Health Organization Standard Acupuncture Point Locations in the Western Pacific Region (WHO Standard) as our corpus, which consists of descriptions of 361 acupoints. Five types of relations ('direction_of,' 'distance_of,' 'part_of,' 'near_acupoint,' and 'located_near') (n= 3,174) between acupoints were annotated. Five models were compared: BioBERT, LSTM, pre-trained GPT-3.5, and fine-tuned GPT-3.5, as well as pre-trained GPT-4. Performance metrics included micro-average exact match precision, recall, and F1 scores. Our results demonstrate that fine-tuned GPT-3.5 consistently outperformed other models in F1 scores across all relation types. Overall, it achieved the highest micro-average F1 score of 0.92. This study underscores the effectiveness of LLMs like GPT in extracting relations related to acupoint locations, with implications for accurately modeling acupuncture knowledge and promoting standard implementation in acupuncture training and practice. The findings also contribute to advancing informatics applications in traditional and complementary medicine, showcasing the potential of LLMs in natural language processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[PerkwE_COQA: enhance Persian Conversational Question Answering by combining contextual keyword extraction with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05406v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart cities need the involvement of their residents to enhance quality of life. Conversational query-answering is an emerging approach for user engagement. There is an increasing demand of an advanced conversational question-answering that goes beyond classic systems. Existing approaches have shown that LLMs offer promising capabilities for CQA, but may struggle to capture the nuances of conversational contexts. The new approach involves understanding the content and engaging in a multi-step conversation with the user to fulfill their needs. This paper presents a novel method to elevate the performance of Persian Conversational question-answering (CQA) systems. It combines the strengths of Large Language Models (LLMs) with contextual keyword extraction. Our method extracts keywords specific to the conversational flow, providing the LLM with additional context to understand the user's intent and generate more relevant and coherent responses. We evaluated the effectiveness of this combined approach through various metrics, demonstrating significant improvements in CQA performance compared to an LLM-only baseline. The proposed method effectively handles implicit questions, delivers contextually relevant answers, and tackles complex questions that rely heavily on conversational context. The findings indicate that our method outperformed the evaluation benchmarks up to 8% higher than existing methods and the LLM-only baseline.</p></details> |  |

Researchers and practitioners have met these concerns by introducing an abundance of new datasets for evaluating and improving LLM safety. However, much of this work has happened in parallel, and with very different goals in mind, ranging from the mitigation of near-term risks around bias and toxic content generation to the assessment of longer-term catastrophic risk potential. This makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to find the most relevant datasets for a given use case, and to identify gaps in dataset coverage that future work may fill. To remedy these issues, we conduct a first systematic review of open datasets for evaluating and improving LLM safety. We review 102 datasets, which we identified through an iterative and community-driven process over the course of several months. We highlight patterns and trends, such as a a trend towards fully synthetic datasets, as well as gaps in dataset coverage, such as a clear lack of non-English datasets. We also examine how LLM safety datasets are used in practice -- in LLM release publications and popular LLM benchmarks -- finding that current evaluation practices are highly idiosyncratic and make use of only a small fraction of available datasets. Our contributions are based on SafetyPrompts.com, a living catalogue of open datasets for LLM safety, which we commit to updating continuously as the field of LLM safety develops.</p></details> |  |

To that end, algebraic wall modeling is implemented in the popular SEM solver Nek5000. It is combined with explicit subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling, which is shown to perform better than the high-frequency filtering traditionally used with the SEM. In particular, the Vreman model exhibits a good balance in terms stabilizing the simulations, yet retaining good resolution of the turbulent scales. Some difficulties associated with SEM simulations on relatively coarse grids are also revealed: jumps in derivatives across element boundaries, lack of convergence for weakly formulated boundary conditions, and the necessity for the SGS model as a damper for high-frequency modes. In spite of these, state-of-the-art accuracy is achieved for turbulent channel flow and flat-plate turbulent boundary layer flow cases, proving the SEM to be a an excellent numerical framework for massively-parallel high-order WMLES.</p></details> |  |

However, the potential of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) for multimodal misinformation detection remains underexplored. Besides, how to teach LLMs to interpret multimodal misinformation in cost-effective and accessible way is still an open question. To address that, we propose MMIDR, a framework designed to teach LLMs in providing fluent and high-quality textual explanations for their decision-making process of multimodal misinformation. To convert multimodal misinformation into an appropriate instruction-following format, we present a data augmentation perspective and pipeline. This pipeline consists of a visual information processing module and an evidence retrieval module. Subsequently, we prompt the proprietary LLMs with processed contents to extract rationales for interpreting the authenticity of multimodal misinformation. Furthermore, we design an efficient knowledge distillation approach to distill the capability of proprietary LLMs in explaining multimodal misinformation into open-source LLMs. To explore several research questions regarding the performance of LLMs in multimodal misinformation detection tasks, we construct an instruction-following multimodal misinformation dataset and conduct comprehensive experiments. The experimental findings reveal that our MMIDR exhibits sufficient detection performance and possesses the capacity to provide compelling rationales to support its assessments.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Long-horizon tasks for quadrupeds are challenging since they require both a high-level understanding of the semantics of the problem for task planning and a broad range of locomotion and manipulation skills to interact with the environment. Our system builds a high-level reasoning layer with large language models, which generates hybrid discrete-continuous plans as robot code from task descriptions. It comprises multiple LLM agents: a semantic planner for sketching a plan, a parameter calculator for predicting arguments in the plan, and a code generator to convert the plan into executable robot code. At the low level, we adopt reinforcement learning to train a set of motion planning and control skills to unleash the flexibility of quadrupeds for rich environment interactions. Our system is tested on long-horizon tasks that are infeasible to complete with one single skill. Simulation and real-world experiments show that it successfully figures out multi-step strategies and demonstrates non-trivial behaviors, including building tools or notifying a human for help.</p></details> |  |

Currently, the existing algorithms for qubit mapping encounter difficulties when dealing with larger circuit sizes involving hundreds of qubits. In this paper, we introduce an innovative qubit mapping algorithm, Duostra, tailored to address the challenge of implementing large-scale quantum circuits on real hardware devices with limited connectivity. Duostra operates by efficiently determining optimal paths for double-qubit gates and inserting SWAP gates accordingly to implement the double-qubit operations on real devices. Together with two heuristic scheduling algorithms, the Limitedly-Exhausitive (LE) Search and the Shortest-Path (SP) Estimation, it yields results of good quality within a reasonable runtime, thereby striving toward achieving quantum advantage. Experimental results showcase our algorithm's superiority, especially for large circuits beyond the NISQ era. For example, on large circuits with more than 50 qubits, we can reduce the mapping cost on an average 21.75% over the virtual best results among QMAP, t|ket>, Qiskit and SABRE. Besides, for mid-size circuits such as the SABRE-large benchmark, we improve the mapping costs by 4.5%, 5.2%, 16.3%, 20.7%, and 25.7%, when compared to QMAP, TOQM, t|ket>, Qiskit, and SABRE, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: r...</summary><p>v4: restructured and more new numerical experiments added</p></details> |

Image modalities, enriched with profound semantic information and a more continuous mathematical nature compared to other modalities, greatly enhance the functionalities of MLLMs when integrated. However, this integration serves as a double-edged sword, providing attackers with expansive vulnerabilities to exploit for highly covert and harmful attacks. The pursuit of reliable AI systems like powerful MLLMs has emerged as a pivotal area of contemporary research. In this paper, we endeavor to demostrate the multifaceted risks associated with the incorporation of image modalities into MLLMs. Initially, we delineate the foundational components and training processes of MLLMs. Subsequently, we construct a threat model, outlining the security vulnerabilities intrinsic to MLLMs. Moreover, we analyze and summarize existing scholarly discourses on MLLMs' attack and defense mechanisms, culminating in suggestions for the future research on MLLM security. Through this comprehensive analysis, we aim to deepen the academic understanding of MLLM security challenges and propel forward the development of trustworthy MLLM systems.</p></details> | 8 pages, 1 figure |

However, previous works that employ LLMs/MLLMs for document understanding have not fully explored and utilized the document layout information, which is vital for precise document understanding. In this paper, we propose LayoutLLM, an LLM/MLLM based method for document understanding. The core of LayoutLLM is a layout instruction tuning strategy, which is specially designed to enhance the comprehension and utilization of document layouts. The proposed layout instruction tuning strategy consists of two components: Layout-aware Pre-training and Layout-aware Supervised Fine-tuning. To capture the characteristics of document layout in Layout-aware Pre-training, three groups of pre-training tasks, corresponding to document-level, region-level and segment-level information, are introduced. Furthermore, a novel module called layout chain-of-thought (LayoutCoT) is devised to enable LayoutLLM to focus on regions relevant to the question and generate accurate answers. LayoutCoT is effective for boosting the performance of document understanding. Meanwhile, it brings a certain degree of interpretability, which could facilitate manual inspection and correction. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that the proposed LayoutLLM significantly outperforms existing methods that adopt open-source 7B LLMs/MLLMs for document understanding. The training data of the LayoutLLM is publicly available at https://github.com/AlibabaResearch/AdvancedLiterateMachinery/tree/main/DocumentUnderstanding/LayoutLLM</p></details> | CVPR 2024 |

Despite the flux of research on developing advanced reasoning approaches, systematically analyzing the diverse LLMs and reasoning strategies in generating reasoning chains remains a significant challenge. The difficulties stem from the lack of two key elements: (1) an automatic method for evaluating the generated reasoning chains on different tasks, and (2) a unified formalism and implementation of the diverse reasoning approaches for systematic comparison. This paper aims to close the gap: (1) We introduce AutoRace for fully automated reasoning chain evaluation. Existing metrics rely on expensive human annotations or pre-defined LLM prompts not adaptable to different tasks. In contrast, AutoRace automatically creates detailed evaluation criteria tailored for each task, and uses GPT-4 for accurate evaluation following the criteria.

In this paper, we propose SALMONN, a speech audio language music open neural network, built by integrating a pre-trained text-based large language model (LLM) with speech and audio encoders into a single multimodal model. SALMONN enables the LLM to directly process and understand general audio inputs and achieve competitive performances on a number of speech and audio tasks used in training, such as automatic speech recognition and translation, auditory-information-based question answering, emotion recognition, speaker verification, and music and audio captioning etc. SALMONN also has a diverse set of emergent abilities unseen in the training, which includes but is not limited to speech translation to untrained languages, speech-based slot filling, spoken-query-based question answering, audio-based storytelling, and speech audio co-reasoning etc. The presence of cross-modal emergent abilities is studied, and a novel few-shot activation tuning approach is proposed to activate such abilities. To our knowledge, SALMONN is the first model of its type and can be regarded as a step towards AI with generic hearing abilities. The source code, model checkpoints and data are available at https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN.</p></details> |  |

Note that high-quality instruction data is the vital key for enhancing the specific capabilities of LLMs, while current IE datasets tend to be small in scale, fragmented, and lack standardized schema. To this end, we introduce IEPile, a comprehensive bilingual (English and Chinese) IE instruction corpus, which contains approximately 0.32B tokens. We construct IEPile by collecting and cleaning 33 existing IE datasets, and introduce schema-based instruction generation to unearth a large-scale corpus. Experimental results on LLaMA, Baichuan and Qwen demonstrate that using IEPile can enhance the performance of LLMs for IE, especially the zero-shot generalization. We open-source the resource and pre-trained models, hoping to provide valuable support to the NLP community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Ongoi...</summary><p>Ongoing work; 19 pages; Github: https://github.com/zjunlp/IEPile</p></details> |

This underexplored problem poses new challenges at the pre-writing stage, including how to research the topic and prepare an outline prior to writing. We propose STORM, a writing system for the Synthesis of Topic Outlines through Retrieval and Multi-perspective Question Asking. STORM models the pre-writing stage by (1) discovering diverse perspectives in researching the given topic, (2) simulating conversations where writers carrying different perspectives pose questions to a topic expert grounded on trusted Internet sources, (3) curating the collected information to create an outline. For evaluation, we curate FreshWiki, a dataset of recent high-quality Wikipedia articles, and formulate outline assessments to evaluate the pre-writing stage. We further gather feedback from experienced Wikipedia editors. Compared to articles generated by an outline-driven retrieval-augmented baseline, more of STORM's articles are deemed to be organized (by a 25% absolute increase) and broad in coverage (by 10%). The expert feedback also helps identify new challenges for generating grounded long articles, such as source bias transfer and over-association of unrelated facts.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, NAACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

On The Robustness of Large Language Model IP Protection Methods Against Model Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05188v1)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging is a promising lightweight model empowerment technique that does not rely on expensive computing devices (e.g., GPUs) or require the collection of specific training data. Instead, it involves editing different upstream model parameters to absorb their downstream task capabilities. However, uncertified model merging can infringe upon the Intellectual Property (IP) rights of the original upstream models. In this paper, we conduct the first study on the robustness of IP protection methods in model merging scenarios. We investigate two state-of-the-art IP protection techniques: Quantization Watermarking and Instructional Fingerprint, along with various advanced model merging technologies, such as Task Arithmetic, TIES-MERGING, and so on. Experimental results indicate that current Large Language Model (LLM) watermarking techniques cannot survive in the merged models, whereas model fingerprinting techniques can. Our research aims to highlight that model merging should be an indispensable consideration in the robustness assessment of model IP protection techniques, thereby promoting the healthy development of the open-source LLM community.</p></details> | Technical Report |

This process is commonly known as parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT). Due to the scale of LLM, PEFT operations are usually executed in the public environment (e.g., cloud server). This necessitates the sharing of sensitive user data across public environments, thereby raising potential privacy concerns. To tackle these challenges, we propose a distributed PEFT framework called DLoRA. DLoRA enables scalable PEFT operations to be performed collaboratively between the cloud and user devices. Coupled with the proposed Kill and Revive algorithm, the evaluation results demonstrate that DLoRA can significantly reduce the computation and communication workload over the user devices while achieving superior accuracy and privacy protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLsM: Generative Linguistic Steganography with Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15656v3)** | 2024-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linguistic Steganography (LS) tasks aim to generate steganographic text (stego) based on secret information. Only authorized recipients can perceive the existence of the stegos and extract secrets, thereby preserving privacy. However, existing LS methods do not consider the controllable generation of stegos containing specific discourses such as style, genre, and theme. And they are difficult to simulate high-quality natural texts. As a result, the stegos are easily perceived and detectable, compromising covert communication. This paper proposes the LLsM, the first LS work with the Large Language Model (LLM). Regarding open-source LLMs, we reconstruct the token generator of LLM to the "stego generator" so that it can control the generation of stego based on the secret. In this "stego generator", the candidate pool is encoded by range coding, and the adjustment factor for the interval length is also given. The secret determines the interval, thereby determining the next token. This better simulates the distribution of natural texts and controls the adjustment of the embedding rate. In addition, we preliminarily built an LLsM-c architecture for closed-source LLMs. It encodes discourse to obtain high-quality prompts containing discourse based on secrets, and generates pure natural texts containing discourse. Experiments show that LLsM performs superior to prevalent LS and related-task baselines regarding various kinds of concealment and anti-steganalysis. LLsM's MAUVE surpasses baselines by 60%-80% and anti-steganalysis exceeds baselines by 20%-30%. Notably, LLsM can also generate longer stegos with high quality, showing its advantages in understanding and coherence.</p></details> | 13 pages |

We focus on integrating the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and the Program-of-Thought (PoT) learning, hypothesizing that prioritizing the learning of mathematical reasoning ability is helpful for the amplification of problem-solving ability. Thus, the initial learning with CoT is essential for solving challenging mathematical problems. To this end, we propose a sequential learning approach, named SAAS (Solving Ability Amplification Strategy), which strategically transitions from CoT learning to PoT learning. Our empirical study, involving an extensive performance comparison using several benchmarks, demonstrates that our SAAS achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The results underscore the effectiveness of our sequential learning approach, marking a significant advancement in the field of mathematical reasoning in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Detecting and subsequently diagnosing the disease is challenging because of symptom heterogeneity with respect to complexity, as well as the type and timing of phenotypic manifestations. Typically, language impairment can present in the prodromal phase and precede motor symptoms suggesting that a linguistic-based approach could serve as a diagnostic method for incipient Parkinsons disease. Additionally, improved linguistic models may enhance other approaches through ensemble techniques. The field of large language models is advancing rapidly, presenting the opportunity to explore the use of these new models for detecting Parkinsons disease and to improve on current linguistic approaches with high-dimensional representations of linguistics. We evaluate the application of state-of-the-art large language models to detect Parkinsons disease automatically from spontaneous speech with up to 73% accuracy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

However, handling external disturbances during tasks is still an open challenge. This paper proposes a novel method to achieve robotic adaptive tasks based on LLMs and Behavior Trees (BTs). It utilizes ChatGPT to reason the descriptive steps of tasks. In order to enable ChatGPT to understand the environment, semantic maps are constructed by an object recognition algorithm. Then, we design a Parser module based on Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) to parse these steps into initial BTs. Subsequently, a BTs Update algorithm is proposed to expand the initial BTs dynamically to control robots to perform adaptive tasks. Different from other LLM-based methods for complex robotic tasks, our method outputs variable BTs that can add and execute new actions according to environmental changes, which is robust to external disturbances. Our method is validated with simulation in different practical scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 11figures, WILL PUBLISHED ON ICRA 2024</p></details> |

Synthesizing human-like content using LLMs necessitates vast computational resources and extensive datasets, encapsulating critical intellectual property (IP). However, the generated content is prone to malicious exploitation, including spamming and plagiarism. To address the challenges, REMARK-LLM proposes three new components: (i) a learning-based message encoding module to infuse binary signatures into LLM-generated texts; (ii) a reparameterization module to transform the dense distributions from the message encoding to the sparse distribution of the watermarked textual tokens; (iii) a decoding module dedicated for signature extraction; Furthermore, we introduce an optimized beam search algorithm to guarantee the coherence and consistency of the generated content. REMARK-LLM is rigorously trained to encourage the preservation of semantic integrity in watermarked content, while ensuring effective watermark retrieval. Extensive evaluations on multiple unseen datasets highlight REMARK-LLM proficiency and transferability in inserting 2 times more signature bits into the same texts when compared to prior art, all while maintaining semantic integrity. Furthermore, REMARK-LLM exhibits better resilience against a spectrum of watermark detection and removal attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accept to usenix security 2024</p></details> |

To address this issue, we present a novel video-text learning paradigm, HaVTR, which augments video and text data to learn more generalized features. Specifically, we first adopt a simple augmentation method, which generates self-similar data by randomly duplicating or dropping subwords and frames. In addition, inspired by the recent advancement in visual and language generative models, we propose a more powerful augmentation method through textual paraphrasing and video stylization using large language models (LLMs) and visual generative models (VGMs). Further, to bring richer information into video and text, we propose a hallucination-based augmentation method, where we use LLMs and VGMs to generate and add new relevant information to the original data. Benefiting from the enriched data, extensive experiments on several video-text retrieval benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of HaVTR over existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, the massive scale and computational demands of these models present formidable challenges when considering their practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. While techniques such as chain-of-thought (CoT) distillation have displayed promise in distilling LLMs into small language models (SLMs), there is a risk that distilled SLMs may still inherit flawed reasoning and hallucinations from LLMs. To address these issues, we propose a twofold methodology: First, we introduce a novel method for distilling the self-evaluation capability from LLMs into SLMs, aiming to mitigate the adverse effects of flawed reasoning and hallucinations inherited from LLMs. Second, we advocate for distilling more comprehensive thinking by incorporating multiple distinct CoTs and self-evaluation outputs, to ensure a more thorough and robust knowledge transfer into SLMs. Experiments on three NLP benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly improves the performance of distilled SLMs, offering a new perspective for developing more effective and efficient SLMs in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

However, current LVLMs suffer from misalignment between text and image modalities which causes three kinds of hallucination problems, i.e., object existence, object attribute, and object relationship. To tackle this issue, existing methods mainly utilize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to align modalities in LVLMs. However, they still suffer from three main limitations: (1) General feedback can not indicate the hallucination type contained in the response; (2) Sparse rewards only give the sequence-level reward for the whole response; and (3)Annotation cost is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To handle these limitations, we propose an innovative method to align modalities in LVLMs through Fine-Grained Artificial Intelligence Feedback (FGAIF), which mainly consists of three steps: AI-based Feedback Collection, Fine-grained Reward Model Training, and Reinforcement Learning with Fine-grained Reward. Specifically, We first utilize AI tools to predict the types of hallucination for each segment in the response and obtain a collection of fine-grained feedback. Then, based on the collected reward data, three specialized reward models are trained to produce dense rewards. Finally, a novel fine-grained feedback module is integrated into the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Extensive experiments are conducted on hallucination and general benchmarks, demonstrating the superior performance of our proposed method. Notably, compared with previous models trained with the RL-based aligning method, our proposed method is effective even with fewer parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Safety Generalization Challenges of Large Language Models via Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07865v3)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought about remarkable generative capabilities but also raised concerns about their potential misuse. While strategies like supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback have enhanced their safety, these methods primarily focus on natural languages, which may not generalize to other domains. This paper introduces CodeAttack, a framework that transforms natural language inputs into code inputs, presenting a novel environment for testing the safety generalization of LLMs. Our comprehensive studies on state-of-the-art LLMs including GPT-4, Claude-2, and Llama-2 series reveal a common safety vulnerability of these models against code input: CodeAttack bypasses the safety guardrails of all models more than 80% of the time. We find that a larger distribution gap between CodeAttack and natural language leads to weaker safety generalization, such as encoding natural language input with data structures. Furthermore, we give two hypotheses about the success of CodeAttack: (1) the misaligned bias acquired by LLMs during code training, prioritizing code completion over avoiding the potential safety risk; (2) the limited self-evaluation capability regarding the safety of their code outputs. Finally, we analyze potential mitigation measures. These findings highlight new safety risks in the code domain and the need for more robust safety alignment algorithms to match the code capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Existing research on knowledge editing primarily concentrates on monolingual scenarios, neglecting the complexities presented by multilingual contexts and multi-hop reasoning. To address these challenges, our study introduces MLaKE (Multilingual Language Knowledge Editing), a novel benchmark comprising 4072 multi-hop and 5360 single-hop questions designed to evaluate the adaptability of knowledge editing methods across five languages: English, Chinese, Japanese, French, and German. MLaKE aggregates fact chains from Wikipedia across languages and utilizes LLMs to generate questions in both free-form and multiple-choice. We evaluate the multilingual knowledge editing generalization capabilities of existing methods on MLaKE. Existing knowledge editing methods demonstrate higher success rates in English samples compared to other languages. However, their generalization capabilities are limited in multi-language experiments. Notably, existing knowledge editing methods often show relatively high generalization for languages within the same language family compared to languages from different language families. These results underscore the imperative need for advancements in multilingual knowledge editing and we hope MLaKE can serve as a valuable resource for benchmarking and solution development.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models Can Be End-To-End Recommenders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00702v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recommender systems aim to predict user interest based on historical behavioral data. They are mainly designed in sequential pipelines, requiring lots of data to train different sub-systems, and are hard to scale to new domains. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable generalized capabilities, enabling a singular model to tackle diverse recommendation tasks across various scenarios. Nonetheless, existing LLM-based recommendation systems utilize LLM purely for a single task of the recommendation pipeline. Besides, these systems face challenges in presenting large-scale item sets to LLMs in natural language format, due to the constraint of input length. To address these challenges, we introduce an LLM-based end-to-end recommendation framework: UniLLMRec. Specifically, UniLLMRec integrates multi-stage tasks (e.g. recall, ranking, re-ranking) via chain-of-recommendations. To deal with large-scale items, we propose a novel strategy to structure all items into an item tree, which can be dynamically updated and effectively retrieved. UniLLMRec shows promising zero-shot results in comparison with conventional supervised models. Additionally, it boasts high efficiency, reducing the input token need by 86% compared to existing LLM-based models. Such efficiency not only accelerates task completion but also optimizes resource utilization. To facilitate model understanding and to ensure reproducibility, we have made our code publicly available.</p></details> |  |

In response to this challenge, our study introduces an Adaptive Semantic Space Learning (ASSL) framework, which utilizes the adaptive reorganization of data distributions within the semantic space to enhance the performance and selection efficacy of multi-expert models. Utilizing this framework, we trained a financial multi-task LLM named "SilverSight". Our research findings demonstrate that our framework can achieve results close to those obtained with full data training using only 10% of the data, while also exhibiting strong generalization capabilities.</p></details> | 17 pages, 17 figures |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved great success in various tasks, but their potential is less explored in AES. In this paper, we propose Multi Trait Specialization (MTS), a zero-shot prompting framework to elicit essay scoring capabilities in LLMs. Specifically, we leverage ChatGPT to decompose writing proficiency into distinct traits and generate scoring criteria for each trait. Then, an LLM is prompted to extract trait scores from several conversational rounds, each round scoring one of the traits based on the scoring criteria. Finally, we derive the overall score via trait averaging and min-max scaling. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that MTS consistently outperforms straightforward prompting (Vanilla) in average QWK across all LLMs and datasets, with maximum gains of 0.437 on TOEFL11 and 0.355 on ASAP. Additionally, with the help of MTS, the small-sized Llama2-13b-chat substantially outperforms ChatGPT, facilitating an effective deployment in real applications.</p></details> |  |

To meet these demands, various forms of dynamic sparsity have been proposed that reduce compute on an input-by-input basis. These methods improve over static methods by exploiting the variance across individual inputs, which has steadily grown with the exponential increase in training data. Yet, the increasing depth within modern models, currently with hundreds of layers, has opened opportunities for dynamic layer sparsity, which skips the computation for entire layers. In this work, we explore the practicality of layer sparsity by profiling residual connections and establish the relationship between model depth and layer sparsity. For example, the residual blocks in the OPT-66B model have a median contribution of 5% to its output. We then take advantage of this dynamic sparsity and propose Radial Networks, which perform token-level routing between layers guided by a trained router module. These networks can be used in a post-training distillation from sequential networks or trained from scratch to co-learn the router and layer weights. They enable scaling to larger model sizes by decoupling the number of layers from the dynamic depth of the network, and their design allows for layer reuse. By varying the compute token by token, they reduce the overall resources needed for generating entire sequences. Overall, this leads to larger capacity networks with significantly lower compute and serving costs for large language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors have equal contribution</p></details> |

Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in computer vision and natural language processing, this paper aims to discuss the potential of large time series models in load forecasting with scarce historical data. Specifically, the large time series model is constructed as a time series generative pre-trained transformer (TimeGPT), which is trained on massive and diverse time series datasets consisting of 100 billion data points (e.g., finance, transportation, banking, web traffic, weather, energy, healthcare, etc.). Then, the scarce historical load data is used to fine-tune the TimeGPT, which helps it to adapt to the data distribution and characteristics associated with load forecasting. Simulation results show that TimeGPT outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., popular machine learning models and statistical models) for load forecasting on several real datasets with scarce training samples, particularly for short look-ahead times. However, it cannot be guaranteed that TimeGPT is always superior to benchmarks for load forecasting with scarce data, since the performance of TimeGPT may be affected by the distribution differences between the load data and the training data. In practical applications, we can divide the historical data into a training set and a validation set, and then use the validation set loss to decide whether TimeGPT is the best choice for a specific dataset.</p></details> | 10 pages |

While the specific number varies depending on the desired scope and target languages, we argue that the number of languages, language exposure, and similarity that incorporate the selection of languages for fine-tuning are some important aspects to examine. By fine-tuning large multilingual models on 1 to 52 languages, this paper answers one question: How many languages are needed in instruction fine-tuning for multilingual tasks? We investigate how multilingual instruction fine-tuned models behave on multilingual benchmarks with an increasing number of languages and discuss our findings from the perspective of language exposure and similarity.</p></details> |  |

Without pursuing novel technical modules, we aim to build a simple yet powerful foundation model dealing with any images under any circumstances. To this end, we scale up the dataset by designing a data engine to collect and automatically annotate large-scale unlabeled data (~62M), which significantly enlarges the data coverage and thus is able to reduce the generalization error. We investigate two simple yet effective strategies that make data scaling-up promising. First, a more challenging optimization target is created by leveraging data augmentation tools. It compels the model to actively seek extra visual knowledge and acquire robust representations. Second, an auxiliary supervision is developed to enforce the model to inherit rich semantic priors from pre-trained encoders. We evaluate its zero-shot capabilities extensively, including six public datasets and randomly captured photos. It demonstrates impressive generalization ability. Further, through fine-tuning it with metric depth information from NYUv2 and KITTI, new SOTAs are set. Our better depth model also results in a better depth-conditioned ControlNet.

However, effectively training large-scale 3DGS and rendering it in real-time across various scales remains challenging. This paper introduces CityGaussian (CityGS), which employs a novel divide-and-conquer training approach and Level-of-Detail (LoD) strategy for efficient large-scale 3DGS training and rendering. Specifically, the global scene prior and adaptive training data selection enables efficient training and seamless fusion. Based on fused Gaussian primitives, we generate different detail levels through compression, and realize fast rendering across various scales through the proposed block-wise detail levels selection and aggregation strategy. Extensive experimental results on large-scale scenes demonstrate that our approach attains state-of-theart rendering quality, enabling consistent real-time rendering of largescale scenes across vastly different scales.

| **[Understanding the Potential of FPGA-Based Spatial Acceleration for Large Language Model Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15159v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) boasting billions of parameters have generated a significant demand for efficient deployment in inference workloads. The majority of existing approaches rely on temporal architectures that reuse hardware units for different network layers and operators. However, these methods often encounter challenges in achieving low latency due to considerable memory access overhead. This paper investigates the feasibility and potential of model-specific spatial acceleration for LLM inference on FPGAs. Our approach involves the specialization of distinct hardware units for specific operators or layers, facilitating direct communication between them through a dataflow architecture while minimizing off-chip memory accesses. We introduce a comprehensive analytical model for estimating the performance of a spatial LLM accelerator, taking into account the on-chip compute and memory resources available on an FPGA. Through our analysis, we can determine the scenarios in which FPGA-based spatial acceleration can outperform its GPU-based counterpart. To enable more productive implementations of an LLM model on FPGAs, we further provide a library of high-level synthesis (HLS) kernels that are composable and reusable. This library will be made available as open-source. To validate the effectiveness of both our analytical model and HLS library, we have implemented BERT and GPT2 on an AMD Alveo U280 FPGA device. Experimental results demonstrate our approach can achieve up to 13.4x speedup when compared to previous FPGA-based accelerators for the BERT model. For GPT generative inference, we attain a 2.2x speedup compared to DFX, an FPGA overlay, in the prefill stage, while achieving a 1.9x speedup and a 5.7x improvement in energy efficiency compared to the NVIDIA A100 GPU in the decode stage.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the FCCM'24 Journal Track and will appear in ACM Transactions on Reconfigurable Technology and Systems (TRETS)</p></details> |
| **[Measuring Social Norms of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02491v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new challenge to examine whether large language models understand social norms. In contrast to existing datasets, our dataset requires a fundamental understanding of social norms to solve. Our dataset features the largest set of social norm skills, consisting of 402 skills and 12,383 questions covering a wide set of social norms ranging from opinions and arguments to culture and laws. We design our dataset according to the K-12 curriculum. This enables the direct comparison of the social understanding of large language models to humans, more specifically, elementary students. While prior work generates nearly random accuracy on our benchmark, recent large language models such as GPT3.5-Turbo and LLaMA2-Chat are able to improve the performance significantly, only slightly below human performance. We then propose a multi-agent framework based on large language models to improve the models' ability to understand social norms. This method further improves large language models to be on par with humans. Given the increasing adoption of large language models in real-world applications, our finding is particularly important and presents a unique direction for future improvements.</p></details> |  |

| **[A Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: Generalized Nested Jailbreak Prompts can Fool Large Language Models Easily](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08268v4)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and GPT-4, are designed to provide useful and safe responses. However, adversarial prompts known as 'jailbreaks' can circumvent safeguards, leading LLMs to generate potentially harmful content. Exploring jailbreak prompts can help to better reveal the weaknesses of LLMs and further steer us to secure them. Unfortunately, existing jailbreak methods either suffer from intricate manual design or require optimization on other white-box models, which compromises either generalization or efficiency. In this paper, we generalize jailbreak prompt attacks into two aspects: (1) Prompt Rewriting and (2) Scenario Nesting. Based on this, we propose ReNeLLM, an automatic framework that leverages LLMs themselves to generate effective jailbreak prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReNeLLM significantly improves the attack success rate while greatly reducing the time cost compared to existing baselines. Our study also reveals the inadequacy of current defense methods in safeguarding LLMs. Finally, we analyze the failure of LLMs defense from the perspective of prompt execution priority, and propose corresponding defense strategies. We hope that our research can catalyze both the academic community and LLMs developers towards the provision of safer and more regulated LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/ReNeLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accce...</summary><p>Acccepted by NAACL 2024, 18 pages, 7 figures, 13 tables</p></details> |
| **[Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models for Predictive Tabular Tasks in Data Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20208v4)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of data science, the predictive tasks of classification, regression, and imputation of missing values are commonly encountered challenges associated with tabular data. This research endeavors to apply Large Language Models (LLMs) towards addressing these predictive tasks. Despite their proficiency in comprehending natural language, LLMs fall short in dealing with structured tabular data. This limitation stems from their lacking exposure to the intricacies of tabular data during their foundational training. Our research aims to mitigate this gap by compiling a comprehensive corpus of tables annotated with instructions and executing large-scale training of Llama-2 on this enriched dataset. Furthermore, we investigate the practical application of applying the trained model to zero-shot prediction, few-shot prediction, and in-context learning scenarios. Through extensive experiments, our methodology has shown significant improvements over existing benchmarks. These advancements highlight the efficacy of tailoring LLM training to solve table-related problems in data science, thereby establishing a new benchmark in the utilization of LLMs for enhancing tabular intelligence.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[AI-Augmented Surveys: Leveraging Large Language Models and Surveys for Opinion Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09620v3)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) that produce human-like responses have begun to revolutionize research practices in the social sciences. We develop a novel methodological framework that fine-tunes LLMs with repeated cross-sectional surveys to incorporate the meaning of survey questions, individual beliefs, and temporal contexts for opinion prediction. We introduce two new emerging applications of the AI-augmented survey: retrodiction (i.e., predict year-level missing responses) and unasked opinion prediction (i.e., predict entirely missing responses). Among 3,110 binarized opinions from 68,846 Americans in the General Social Survey from 1972 to 2021, our models based on Alpaca-7b excel in retrodiction (AUC = 0.86 for personal opinion prediction, $\rho$ = 0.98 for public opinion prediction). These remarkable prediction capabilities allow us to fill in missing trends with high confidence and pinpoint when public attitudes changed, such as the rising support for same-sex marriage. On the other hand, our fine-tuned Alpaca-7b models show modest success in unasked opinion prediction (AUC = 0.73, $\rho$ = 0.67). We discuss practical constraints and ethical concerns regarding individual autonomy and privacy when using LLMs for opinion prediction. Our study demonstrates that LLMs and surveys can mutually enhance each other's capabilities: LLMs can broaden survey potential, while surveys can improve the alignment of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Challenges Faced by Large Language Models in Solving Multi-Agent Flocking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04752v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flocking is a behavior where multiple agents in a system attempt to stay close to each other while avoiding collision and maintaining a desired formation. This is observed in the natural world and has applications in robotics, including natural disaster search and rescue, wild animal tracking, and perimeter surveillance and patrol. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have displayed an impressive ability to solve various collaboration tasks as individual decision-makers. Solving multi-agent flocking with LLMs would demonstrate their usefulness in situations requiring spatial and decentralized decision-making. Yet, when LLM-powered agents are tasked with implementing multi-agent flocking, they fall short of the desired behavior. After extensive testing, we find that agents with LLMs as individual decision-makers typically opt to converge on the average of their initial positions or diverge from each other. After breaking the problem down, we discover that LLMs cannot understand maintaining a shape or keeping a distance in a meaningful way. Solving multi-agent flocking with LLMs would enhance their ability to understand collaborative spatial reasoning and lay a foundation for addressing more complex multi-agent tasks. This paper discusses the challenges LLMs face in multi-agent flocking and suggests areas for future improvement and research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilingual Brain Surgeon: Large Language Models Can be Compressed Leaving No Language Behind](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04748v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era in Natural Language Processing, but their massive size demands effective compression techniques for practicality. Although numerous model compression techniques have been investigated, they typically rely on a calibration set that overlooks the multilingual context and results in significant accuracy degradation for low-resource languages. This paper introduces Multilingual Brain Surgeon (MBS), a novel calibration data sampling method for multilingual LLMs compression. MBS overcomes the English-centric limitations of existing methods by sampling calibration data from various languages proportionally to the language distribution of the model training datasets. Our experiments, conducted on the BLOOM multilingual LLM, demonstrate that MBS improves the performance of existing English-centric compression methods, especially for low-resource languages. We also uncover the dynamics of language interaction during compression, revealing that the larger the proportion of a language in the training set and the more similar the language is to the calibration language, the better performance the language retains after compression. In conclusion, MBS presents an innovative approach to compressing multilingual LLMs, addressing the performance disparities and improving the language inclusivity of existing compression techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 8 figures, 13 tables.

| **[PoLLMgraph: Unraveling Hallucinations in Large Language Models via State Transition Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04722v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite tremendous advancements in large language models (LLMs) over recent years, a notably urgent challenge for their practical deployment is the phenomenon of hallucination, where the model fabricates facts and produces non-factual statements. In response, we propose PoLLMgraph, a Polygraph for LLMs, as an effective model-based white-box detection and forecasting approach. PoLLMgraph distinctly differs from the large body of existing research that concentrates on addressing such challenges through black-box evaluations. In particular, we demonstrate that hallucination can be effectively detected by analyzing the LLM's internal state transition dynamics during generation via tractable probabilistic models. Experimental results on various open-source LLMs confirm the efficacy of PoLLMgraph, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin, evidenced by over 20% improvement in AUC-ROC on common benchmarking datasets like TruthfulQA. Our work paves a new way for model-based white-box analysis of LLMs, motivating the research community to further explore, understand, and refine the intricate dynamics of LLM behaviors.</p></details> | 15 pages |

However, state-of-the-art SRNs do not adapt the allocation of available network parameters to the complex features found in scientific data, leading to a loss in reconstruction quality. We address this shortcoming with an adaptively placed multi-grid SRN (APMGSRN) and propose a domain decomposition training and inference technique for accelerated parallel training on multi-GPU systems. We also release an open-source neural volume rendering application that allows plug-and-play rendering with any PyTorch-based SRN. Our proposed APMGSRN architecture uses multiple spatially adaptive feature grids that learn where to be placed within the domain to dynamically allocate more neural network resources where error is high in the volume, improving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy of SRNs for scientific data without requiring expensive octree refining, pruning, and traversal like previous adaptive models. In our domain decomposition approach for representing large-scale data, we train an set of APMGSRNs in parallel on separate bricks of the volume to reduce training time while avoiding overhead necessary for an out-of-core solution for volumes too large to fit in GPU memory. After training, the lightweight SRNs are used for realtime neural volume rendering in our open-source renderer, where arbitrary view angles and transfer functions can be explored.

By leveraging the phylogenetic distance metric, we construct dendrograms, which satisfactorily capture distinct LLM families (across a set of 77 open-source and 22 closed models). Furthermore, phylogenetic distance predicts performances in benchmarks (we test MMLU and ARC), thus enabling a time and cost-effective estimation of LLM capabilities. The approach translates genetic concepts to machine learning, offering tools to infer LLM development, relationships, and capabilities, even in the absence of transparent training information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary Classifier Optimization for Large Language Model Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04656v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) to human preferences through preference optimization has been crucial but labor-intensive, necessitating for each prompt a comparison of both a chosen and a rejected text completion by evaluators. Recently, Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) has demonstrated that LLMs can be aligned using merely binary "thumbs-up" or "thumbs-down" signals on each prompt-completion pair. In this paper, we present theoretical foundations to explain the successful alignment achieved through these binary signals. Our analysis uncovers a new perspective: optimizing a binary classifier, whose logit is a reward, implicitly induces minimizing the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) loss. In the process of this discovery, we identified two techniques for effective alignment: reward shift and underlying distribution matching. Consequently, we propose a new algorithm, \textit{Binary Classifier Optimization}, that integrates the techniques. We validate our methodology in two settings: first, on a paired preference dataset, where our method performs on par with DPO and KTO; and second, on binary signal datasets simulating real-world conditions with divergent underlying distributions between thumbs-up and thumbs-down data. Our model consistently demonstrates effective and robust alignment across two base LLMs and three different binary signal datasets, showcasing the strength of our approach to learning from binary feedback.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

However, as LLMs are able to process longer contexts, it becomes more challenging to evaluate whether they have acquired certain capabilities, since the length of text (e.g., 200K tokens) they can process far exceeds what humans can reliably assess in a reasonable duration. In this paper, we propose using complex synthetic tasks as a proxy evaluation method, and present S3Eval, a Synthetic, Scalable, Systematic evaluation suite for LLMs evaluation. The synthetic nature of S3Eval provides users full control over the dataset, allowing them to systematically probe LLM capabilities by scaling text length and varying task difficulty across diverse scenarios. The strong correlation between S3Eval and real-world benchmarks demonstrates the soundness of using S3Eval for evaluation of LLMs. S3Eval provides a flexible and infinite long-context data generation method. We have generated a comprehensive dataset called S3Eval-Standard, and experimental results have shown that it poses significant challenges for all existing LLMs.</p></details> | NAACL 2024 |
| **[Editing Personality for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02168v3)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an innovative task focused on editing the personality traits of Large Language Models (LLMs). This task seeks to adjust the models' responses to opinion-related questions on specified topics since an individual's personality often manifests in the form of their expressed opinions, thereby showcasing different personality traits. Specifically, we construct a new benchmark dataset PersonalityEdit to address this task. Drawing on the theory in Social Psychology, we isolate three representative traits, namely Neuroticism, Extraversion, and Agreeableness, as the foundation for our benchmark. We then gather data using GPT-4, generating responses that not only align with a specified topic but also embody the targeted personality trait. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving various baselines and discuss the representation of personality behavior in LLMs. Our intriguing findings uncover potential challenges of the proposed task, illustrating several remaining issues. We anticipate that our work can provide the NLP community with insights. Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/zjunlp/EasyEdit.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[On the Limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs): False Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04631v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we provide insight into one important limitation of large language models (LLMs), i.e. false attribution, and introduce a new hallucination metric - Simple Hallucination Index (SHI). The task of automatic author attribution for relatively small chunks of text is an important NLP task but can be challenging. We empirically evaluate the power of 3 open SotA LLMs in zero-shot setting (LLaMA-2-13B, Mixtral 8x7B, and Gemma-7B), especially as human annotation can be costly. We collected the top 10 most popular books, according to Project Gutenberg, divided each one into equal chunks of 400 words, and asked each LLM to predict the author. We then randomly sampled 162 chunks for human evaluation from each of the annotated books, based on the error margin of 7% and a confidence level of 95% for the book with the most chunks (Great Expectations by Charles Dickens, having 922 chunks). The average results show that Mixtral 8x7B has the highest prediction accuracy, the lowest SHI, and a Pearson's correlation (r) of 0.737, 0.249, and -0.9996, respectively, followed by LLaMA-2-13B and Gemma-7B. However, Mixtral 8x7B suffers from high hallucinations for 3 books, rising as high as an SHI of 0.87 (in the range 0-1, where 1 is the worst). The strong negative correlation of accuracy and SHI, given by r, demonstrates the fidelity of the new hallucination metric, which is generalizable to other tasks. We publicly release the annotated chunks of data and our codes to aid the reproducibility and evaluation of other models.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Self-Training Large Language Models for Improved Visual Program Synthesis With Visual Reinforcement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04627v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual program synthesis is a promising approach to exploit the reasoning abilities of large language models for compositional computer vision tasks. Previous work has used few-shot prompting with frozen LLMs to synthesize visual programs. Training an LLM to write better visual programs is an attractive prospect, but it is unclear how to accomplish this. No dataset of visual programs for training exists, and acquisition of a visual program dataset cannot be easily crowdsourced due to the need for expert annotators. To get around the lack of direct supervision, we explore improving the program synthesis abilities of an LLM using feedback from interactive experience. We propose a method where we exploit existing annotations for a vision-language task to improvise a coarse reward signal for that task, treat the LLM as a policy, and apply reinforced self-training to improve the visual program synthesis ability of the LLM for that task. We describe a series of experiments on object detection, compositional visual question answering, and image-text retrieval, and show that in each case, the self-trained LLM outperforms or performs on par with few-shot frozen LLMs that are an order of magnitude larger.

Despite their widespread success, existing LLM agents are hindered by generating unreasonable experiment plans within this scenario. To this end, we present DS-Agent, a novel automatic framework that harnesses LLM agent and case-based reasoning (CBR). In the development stage, DS-Agent follows the CBR framework to structure an automatic iteration pipeline, which can flexibly capitalize on the expert knowledge from Kaggle, and facilitate consistent performance improvement through the feedback mechanism. Moreover, DS-Agent implements a low-resource deployment stage with a simplified CBR paradigm to adapt past successful solutions from the development stage for direct code generation, significantly reducing the demand on foundational capabilities of LLMs. Empirically, DS-Agent with GPT-4 achieves an unprecedented 100% success rate in the development stage, while attaining 36% improvement on average one pass rate across alternative LLMs in the deployment stage. In both stages, DS-Agent achieves the best rank in performance, costing \$1.60 and \$0.13 per run with GPT-4, respectively.

Numerous recent studies have investigated the application of LLMs to enhance vulnerability detection and repair tasks. Despite the increasing research interest, there is currently no existing survey that focuses on the utilization of LLMs for vulnerability detection and repair. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by offering a systematic literature review of approaches aimed at improving vulnerability detection and repair through the utilization of LLMs. The review encompasses research work from leading SE, AI, and Security conferences and journals, covering 36 papers published at 21 distinct venues. By answering three key research questions, we aim to (1) summarize the LLMs employed in the relevant literature, (2) categorize various LLM adaptation techniques in vulnerability detection, and (3) classify various LLM adaptation techniques in vulnerability repair. Based on our findings, we have identified a series of challenges that still need to be tackled considering existing studies. Additionally, we have outlined a roadmap highlighting potential opportunities that we believe are pertinent and crucial for future research endeavors.</p></details> | 11 pages |

While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) offers a solution, its extensive training costs make Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) a more practical approach for LLMs. In existing studies, activation outliers in particular channels are identified as the bottleneck to PTQ accuracy. They propose to transform the magnitudes from activations to weights, which however offers limited alleviation or suffers from unstable gradients, resulting in a severe performance drop at low-bitwidth. In this paper, we propose QLLM, an accurate and efficient low-bitwidth PTQ method designed for LLMs. QLLM introduces an adaptive channel reassembly technique that reallocates the magnitude of outliers to other channels, thereby mitigating their impact on the quantization range. This is achieved by channel disassembly and channel assembly, which first breaks down the outlier channels into several sub-channels to ensure a more balanced distribution of activation magnitudes. Then similar channels are merged to maintain the original channel number for efficiency. Additionally, an adaptive strategy is designed to autonomously determine the optimal number of sub-channels for channel disassembly. To further compensate for the performance loss caused by quantization, we propose an efficient tuning method that only learns a small number of low-rank weights while freezing the pre-trained quantized model. After training, these low-rank parameters can be fused into the frozen weights without affecting inference. Extensive experiments on LLaMA-1 and LLaMA-2 show that QLLM can obtain accurate quantized models efficiently. For example, QLLM quantizes the 4-bit LLaMA-2-70B within 10 hours on a single A100-80G GPU, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art method by 7.89% on the average accuracy across five zero-shot tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2024 camera ready; Code is available at https://github.com/ziplab/QLLM and https://github.com/ModelTC/QLLM</p></details> |

Temperature Network Meets Large Foundation Models via DRO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04575v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The temperature parameter plays a profound role during training and/or inference with large foundation models (LFMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and CLIP models. Particularly, it adjusts the logits in the softmax function in LLMs, which is crucial for next token generation, and it scales the similarities in the contrastive loss for training CLIP models. A significant question remains: Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of any input data for enhancing LFMs"? In this paper, we present a principled framework for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet) to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with a robust loss underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks. Our experiments on LLMs and CLIP models demonstrate that TempNet greatly improves the performance of existing solutions or models, e.g. Table 1. The code to reproduce the experimental results in this paper can be found at https://github.com/zhqiu/TempNet.</p></details> | 41 pages, 10 figures |

Subsequently, the paper presents a vision for a future where efficient and green LLM4SE revolutionizes the software engineering tool landscape, benefiting various stakeholders, including industry, individual practitioners, and society. The paper then delineates a roadmap for future research, outlining specific research paths and potential solutions for the research community to pursue. While not intended to be a definitive guide, the paper aims to inspire further progress, with the ultimate goal of establishing efficient and green LLM4SE as a central element in the future of software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correcting misinformation on social media with a large language model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11169v2)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world misinformation can be partially correct and even factual but misleading. It undermines public trust in science and democracy, particularly on social media, where it can spread rapidly. High-quality and timely correction of misinformation that identifies and explains its (in)accuracies has been shown to effectively reduce false beliefs. Despite the wide acceptance of manual correction, it is difficult to promptly correct newly created misinformation and to scale this approach, a concern as technologies like large language models (LLMs) make misinformation easier to produce. LLMs also have versatile capabilities that could accelerate misinformation correction--however, they struggle due to a lack of recent information, a tendency to produce false content, and limitations in addressing multimodal information. We propose MUSE, an LLM augmented with access to and credibility evaluation of up-to-date information. By retrieving evidence as refutations or contexts, MUSE identifies and explains (in)accuracies in a piece of content--not presupposed to be misinformation--with references. It also describes images and conducts multimodal searches to verify and correct multimodal content. Fact-checking experts evaluate responses to social media content that are not presupposed to be (non-)misinformation but broadly include incorrect, partially correct, and correct posts, that may or may not be misleading. We propose and evaluate 13 dimensions of misinformation correction quality, ranging from the accuracy of identifications and factuality of explanations to the relevance and credibility of references. The results demonstrate MUSE's ability to promptly write high-quality responses to potential misinformation on social media--overall, MUSE outperforms GPT-4 by 37% and even high-quality responses from laypeople by 29%.</p></details> | 52 pages |

As a notable milestone in large language models (LLMs), ChatGPT has gained significant attention due to its exceptional natural language processing capabilities. In this study, we present a thorough exploration of ChatGPT's proficiency in generating, explaining, and detecting fake news as follows. Generation -- We employ four prompt methods to generate fake news samples and prove the high quality of these samples through both self-assessment and human evaluation. Explanation -- We obtain nine features to characterize fake news based on ChatGPT's explanations and analyze the distribution of these factors across multiple public datasets. Detection -- We examine ChatGPT's capacity to identify fake news. We explore its detection consistency and then propose a reason-aware prompt method to improve its performance. Although our experiments demonstrate that ChatGPT shows commendable performance in detecting fake news, there is still room for its improvement. Consequently, we further probe into the potential extra information that could bolster its effectiveness in detecting fake news.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a query-dependent parameter efficient fine-tuning (Q-PEFT) approach for text reranking to leak the information of the true queries to LLMs and then make the generation of true queries from input documents much easier. Specifically, we utilize the query to extract the top-$k$ tokens from concatenated documents, serving as contextual clues. We further augment Q-PEFT by substituting the retrieval mechanism with a multi-head attention layer to achieve end-to-end training and cover all the tokens in the documents, guiding the LLMs to generate more document-specific synthetic queries, thereby further improving the reranking performance. Extensive experiments are conducted on four public datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Visual and Text Prompting for Improved Object-Centric Perception with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04514v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro face challenges in achieving human-level perception in Visual Question Answering (VQA), particularly in object-oriented perception tasks which demand fine-grained understanding of object identities, locations or attributes, as indicated by empirical findings. This is mainly due to their limited capability to effectively integrate complex visual cues with textual information and potential object hallucinations. In this paper, we present a novel approach, Joint Visual and Text Prompting (VTPrompt), that employs fine-grained visual information to enhance the capability of MLLMs in VQA, especially for object-oriented perception. VTPrompt merges visual and text prompts to extract key concepts from textual questions and employs a detection model to highlight relevant objects as visual prompts in images. The processed images alongside text prompts are subsequently fed into MLLMs to produce more accurate answers. Our experiments with GPT-4V and Gemini Pro, on three benchmarks, i.e., MME , MMB and POPE, demonstrate significant improvements. Particularly, our method led to a score improvement of up to 183.5 for GPT-4V on MME and enhanced MMB performance by 8.17\% for GPT-4V and 15.69\% for Gemini Pro.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional rumors or fake news editors who mainly rely on generated and/or counterfeited images, text and videos, current misinformation creators now more tend to use out-of-context multimedia contents (e.g. mismatched images and captions) to deceive the public and fake news detection systems. This new type of misinformation increases the difficulty of not only detection but also clarification, because every individual modality is close enough to true information. To address this challenge, in this paper we explore how to achieve interpretable cross-modal de-contextualization detection that simultaneously identifies the mismatched pairs and the cross-modal contradictions, which is helpful for fact-check websites to document clarifications. The proposed model first symbolically disassembles the text-modality information to a set of fact queries based on the Abstract Meaning Representation of the caption and then forwards the query-image pairs into a pre-trained large vision-language model select the ``evidences" that are helpful for us to detect misinformation. Extensive experiments indicate that the proposed methodology can provide us with much more interpretable predictions while maintaining the accuracy same as the state-of-the-art model on this task.</p></details> | 9 Pages, 3 Figures |

Existing works show that appropriate prompt design, such as Chain-of-Thoughts, can unlock LLM's powerful capacity in diverse areas. However, when handling tasks involving repetitive sub-tasks and/or deceptive contents, such as arithmetic calculation and article-level fake news detection, existing prompting strategies either suffers from insufficient expressive power or intermediate errors triggered by hallucination. To make LLM more discerning to such intermediate errors, we propose to guide LLM with a Divide-and-Conquer program that simultaneously ensures superior expressive power and disentangles task decomposition, sub-task resolution, and resolution assembly process. Theoretic analysis reveals that our strategy can guide LLM to extend the expressive power of fixed-depth Transformer. Experiments indicate that our proposed method can achieve better performance than typical prompting strategies in tasks bothered by intermediate errors and deceptive contents, such as large integer multiplication, hallucination detection and misinformation detection.</p></details> | Preprint |

The large body of work on SAR demonstrates its potential to provide at-home support that complements clinic-based interventions delivered by mental health professionals, making these interventions more effective and accessible. However, there are still several major technical challenges that hinder SAR-mediated interactions and interventions from reaching human-level social intelligence and efficacy. With the recent advances in large language models (LLMs), there is an increased potential for novel applications within the field of SAR that can significantly expand the current capabilities of SARs. However, incorporating LLMs introduces new risks and ethical concerns that have not yet been encountered, and must be carefully be addressed to safely deploy these more advanced systems. In this work, we aim to conduct a brief survey on the use of LLMs in SAR technologies, and discuss the potentials and risks of applying LLMs to the following three major technical challenges of SAR: 1) natural language dialog; 2) multimodal understanding; 3) LLMs as robot policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, accepted to the Proceedings of the AAAI Symposium Series, 2024</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting entity-specific sentiment from political news articles. Leveraging zero-shot and few-shot strategies, we explore the capability of LLMs to discern sentiment towards political entities in news content. Employing a chain-of-thought (COT) approach augmented with rationale in few-shot in-context learning, we assess whether this method enhances sentiment prediction accuracy. Our evaluation on sentiment-labeled datasets demonstrates that LLMs, outperform fine-tuned BERT models in capturing entity-specific sentiment. We find that learning in-context significantly improves model performance, while the self-consistency mechanism enhances consistency in sentiment prediction. Despite the promising results, we observe inconsistencies in the effectiveness of the COT prompting method. Overall, our findings underscore the potential of LLMs in entity-centric sentiment analysis within the political news domain and highlight the importance of suitable prompting strategies and model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in PoliticalNLP workshop co-located with LREC-COLING 2024</p></details> |

This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) trained on public data can improve the quality of pre-training data for the on-device language models trained with DP and FL. We carefully design LLM prompts to filter and transform existing public data, and generate new data to resemble the real user data distribution. The model pre-trained on our synthetic dataset achieves relative improvement of 19.0% and 22.8% in next word prediction accuracy compared to the baseline model pre-trained on a standard public dataset, when evaluated over the real user data in Gboard (Google Keyboard, a production mobile keyboard application). Furthermore, our method achieves evaluation accuracy better than or comparable to the baseline during the DP FL fine-tuning over millions of mobile devices, and our final model outperforms the baseline in production A/B testing. Our experiments demonstrate the strengths of LLMs in synthesizing data close to the private distribution even without accessing the private data, and also suggest future research directions to further reduce the distribution gap.</p></details> |  |

These ambiguities offer rich insights into the interaction between semantic structure and world knowledge in language processing. Despite this, there has been little research into how modern large language models treat them. In this paper, we investigate how different versions of certain autoregressive language models -- GPT-2, GPT-3/3.5, Llama 2 and GPT-4 -- treat scope ambiguous sentences, and compare this with human judgments. We introduce novel datasets that contain a joint total of almost 1,000 unique scope-ambiguous sentences, containing interactions between a range of semantic operators, and annotated for human judgments. Using these datasets, we find evidence that several models (i) are sensitive to the meaning ambiguity in these sentences, in a way that patterns well with human judgments, and (ii) can successfully identify human-preferred readings at a high level of accuracy (over 90% in some cases).</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics</p></details> |

So far, researchers have been the main powerhouse behind hypothesis generation by painstaking data analysis and thinking (also known as the Eureka moment). In this paper, we examine the potential of large language models (LLMs) to generate hypotheses. We focus on hypothesis generation based on data (i.e., labeled examples). To enable LLMs to handle arbitrarily long contexts, we generate initial hypotheses from a small number of examples and then update them iteratively to improve the quality of hypotheses. Inspired by multi-armed bandits, we design a reward function to inform the exploitation-exploration tradeoff in the update process. Our algorithm is able to generate hypotheses that enable much better predictive performance than few-shot prompting in classification tasks, improving accuracy by 31.7% on a synthetic dataset and by 13.9%, 3.3% and, 24.9% on three real-world datasets. We also outperform supervised learning by 12.8% and 11.2% on two challenging real-world datasets. Furthermore, we find that the generated hypotheses not only corroborate human-verified theories but also uncover new insights for the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 6 figures, code link: https://github.com/ChicagoHAI/hypothesis_generation</p></details> |

However, existing methods encounter challenges in effectively handling both image and video understanding, particularly with limited visual tokens. In this work, we introduce Chat-UniVi, a Unified Vision-language model capable of comprehending and engaging in conversations involving images and videos through a unified visual representation. Specifically, we employ a set of dynamic visual tokens to uniformly represent images and videos. This representation framework empowers the model to efficiently utilize a limited number of visual tokens to simultaneously capture the spatial details necessary for images and the comprehensive temporal relationship required for videos. Moreover, we leverage a multi-scale representation, enabling the model to perceive both high-level semantic concepts and low-level visual details. Notably, Chat-UniVi is trained on a mixed dataset containing both images and videos, allowing direct application to tasks involving both mediums without requiring any modifications. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that Chat-UniVi consistently outperforms even existing methods exclusively designed for either images or videos.

However, data annotation is time-consuming and expensive, especially when the task involves a large amount of data or requires specialized domains. Recently, GPT-3.5 series models have demonstrated remarkable few-shot and zero-shot ability across various NLP tasks. In this paper, we first claim that large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3.5, can serve as an excellent crowdsourced annotator when provided with sufficient guidance and demonstrated examples. Accordingly, we propose AnnoLLM, an annotation system powered by LLMs, which adopts a two-step approach, explain-then-annotate. Concretely, we first prompt LLMs to provide explanations for why the specific ground truth answer/label was assigned for a given example. Then, we construct the few-shot chain-of-thought prompt with the self-generated explanation and employ it to annotate the unlabeled data with LLMs. Our experiment results on three tasks, including user input and keyword relevance assessment, BoolQ, and WiC, demonstrate that AnnoLLM surpasses or performs on par with crowdsourced annotators. Furthermore, we build the first conversation-based information retrieval dataset employing AnnoLLM. This dataset is designed to facilitate the development of retrieval models capable of retrieving pertinent documents for conversational text. Human evaluation has validated the dataset's high quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NAACL 2024</p></details> |
| **[Large language models as oracles for instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04108v1)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge. Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes andproperties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multi- ple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is semi-automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

However, existing solutions struggle to reconstruct urban outdoor scenes due to their large, unbounded, and highly detailed nature. Hence, to achieve accurate reconstructions, additional supervision data such as LiDAR, strong geometric priors, and long training times are required. To tackle such issues, we present SCILLA, a new hybrid implicit surface learning method to reconstruct large driving scenes from 2D images. SCILLA's hybrid architecture models two separate implicit fields: one for the volumetric density and another for the signed distance to the surface. To accurately represent urban outdoor scenarios, we introduce a novel volume-rendering strategy that relies on self-supervised probabilistic density estimation to sample points near the surface and transition progressively from volumetric to surface representation. Our solution permits a proper and fast initialization of the signed distance field without relying on any geometric prior on the scene, compared to concurrent methods. By conducting extensive experiments on four outdoor driving datasets, we show that SCILLA can learn an accurate and detailed 3D surface scene representation in various urban scenarios while being two times faster to train compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> |  |

While research in Deepfake detection has grown rapidly in response, many detection methods struggle with unseen Deepfakes generated by new synthesis techniques. To address this generalisation challenge, we propose a novel Deepfake detection approach by adapting rich information encoded inside the Foundation Models with rich information encoded inside, specifically using the image encoder from CLIP which has demonstrated strong zero-shot capability for downstream tasks. Inspired by the recent advances of parameter efficient fine-tuning, we propose a novel side-network-based decoder to extract spatial and temporal cues from the given video clip, with the promotion of the Facial Component Guidance (FCG) to guidencourage the spatial feature to include features of key facial parts for more robust and general Deepfake detection. Through extensive cross-dataset evaluations, our approach exhibits superior effectiveness in identifying unseen Deepfake samples, achieving notable performance improvementsuccess even with limited training samples and manipulation types. Our model secures an average performance enhancement of 0.9% AUROC in cross-dataset assessments comparing with state-of-the-art methods, especiallytablishing a significant lead of achieving 4.4% improvement on the challenging DFDC dataset.</p></details> |  |

Yet, challenges persist, including generalization across scenarios, maintaining reliability, and ensuring real-time responsiveness. This paper introduces a perception framework grounded in foundation models for universal object detection and tracking, moving beyond specific training categories. Integral to our approach is a multi-layered tracker integrated with the foundation detector, ensuring continuous target visibility, even when faced with motion blur, abrupt light shifts, and occlusions. Complementing this, we introduce a model-free controller tailored for resilient quadrotor visual tracking. Our system operates efficiently on limited hardware, relying solely on an onboard camera and an inertial measurement unit. Through extensive validation in diverse challenging indoor and outdoor environments, we demonstrate our system's effectiveness and adaptability. In conclusion, our research represents a step forward in quadrotor visual tracking, moving from task-specific methods to more versatile and adaptable operations.</p></details> |  |

However, clinical adoption of computational models has been hampered by the lack of generalization due to large batch effects, small dataset sizes, and poor performance in transfer learning from natural images. To address these challenges, we introduce DinoBloom, the first foundation model for single cell images in hematology, utilizing a tailored DINOv2 pipeline. Our model is built upon an extensive collection of 13 diverse, publicly available datasets of peripheral blood and bone marrow smears, the most substantial open-source cohort in hematology so far, comprising over 380,000 white blood cell images. To assess its generalization capability, we evaluate it on an external dataset with a challenging domain shift. We show that our model outperforms existing medical and non-medical vision models in (i) linear probing and k-nearest neighbor evaluations for cell-type classification on blood and bone marrow smears and (ii) weakly supervised multiple instance learning for acute myeloid leukemia subtyping by a large margin. A family of four DinoBloom models (small, base, large, and giant) can be adapted for a wide range of downstream applications, be a strong baseline for classification problems, and facilitate the assessment of batch effects in new datasets. All models are available at github.com/marrlab/DinoBloom.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Re-Embedding: Towards Foundation Model-Level Performance in Computational Pathology](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17228v2)** | 2024-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple instance learning (MIL) is the most widely used framework in computational pathology, encompassing sub-typing, diagnosis, prognosis, and more. However, the existing MIL paradigm typically requires an offline instance feature extractor, such as a pre-trained ResNet or a foundation model. This approach lacks the capability for feature fine-tuning within the specific downstream tasks, limiting its adaptability and performance. To address this issue, we propose a Re-embedded Regional Transformer (R$^2$T) for re-embedding the instance features online, which captures fine-grained local features and establishes connections across different regions. Unlike existing works that focus on pre-training powerful feature extractor or designing sophisticated instance aggregator, R$^2$T is tailored to re-embed instance features online. It serves as a portable module that can seamlessly integrate into mainstream MIL models. Extensive experimental results on common computational pathology tasks validate that: 1) feature re-embedding improves the performance of MIL models based on ResNet-50 features to the level of foundation model features, and further enhances the performance of foundation model features; 2) the R$^2$T can introduce more significant performance improvements to various MIL models; 3) R$^2$T-MIL, as an R$^2$T-enhanced AB-MIL, outperforms other latest methods by a large margin.The code is available at: https://github.com/DearCaat/RRT-MIL.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

Temperature Network Meets Large Foundation Models via DRO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04575v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The temperature parameter plays a profound role during training and/or inference with large foundation models (LFMs) such as large language models (LLMs) and CLIP models. Particularly, it adjusts the logits in the softmax function in LLMs, which is crucial for next token generation, and it scales the similarities in the contrastive loss for training CLIP models. A significant question remains: Is it viable to learn a neural network to predict a personalized temperature of any input data for enhancing LFMs"? In this paper, we present a principled framework for learning a small yet generalizable temperature prediction network (TempNet) to improve LFMs. Our solution is composed of a novel learning framework with a robust loss underpinned by constrained distributionally robust optimization (DRO), and a properly designed TempNet with theoretical inspiration. TempNet can be trained together with a large foundation model from scratch or learned separately given a pretrained foundation model. It is not only useful for predicting personalized temperature to promote the training of LFMs but also generalizable and transferable to new tasks. Our experiments on LLMs and CLIP models demonstrate that TempNet greatly improves the performance of existing solutions or models, e.g. Table 1.

| **[The Case for Developing a Foundation Model for Planning-like Tasks from Scratch](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04540v1)** | 2024-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation Models (FMs) have revolutionized many areas of computing, including Automated Planning and Scheduling (APS). For example, a recent study found them useful for planning problems: plan generation, language translation, model construction, multi-agent planning, interactive planning, heuristics optimization, tool integration, and brain-inspired planning. Besides APS, there are many seemingly related tasks involving the generation of a series of actions with varying guarantees of their executability to achieve intended goals, which we collectively call planning-like (PL) tasks like business processes, programs, workflows, and guidelines, where researchers have considered using FMs. However, previous works have primarily focused on pre-trained, off-the-shelf FMs and optionally fine-tuned them. This paper discusses the need for a comprehensive FM for PL tasks from scratch and explores its design considerations. We argue that such an FM will open new and efficient avenues for PL problem-solving, just like LLMs are creating for APS.</p></details> |  |

On all three tasks, we show that a foundation-model-based approach outperforms the task-specific models and so the state of the art. Further, our approach often surpasses human-expert task performance. We investigate the fundamental characteristics of this approach including generalizability to several foundation models and the impact of non-determinism on the outputs. All in all, this suggests a future direction in which disparate data management tasks can be unified under foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in VLDB 2024</p></details> |
| **[Foundations of Cyber Resilience: The Confluence of Game, Control, and Learning Theories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01205v2)** | 2024-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber resilience is a complementary concept to cybersecurity, focusing on the preparation, response, and recovery from cyber threats that are challenging to prevent. Organizations increasingly face such threats in an evolving cyber threat landscape. Understanding and establishing foundations for cyber resilience provide a quantitative and systematic approach to cyber risk assessment, mitigation policy evaluation, and risk-informed defense design. A systems-scientific view toward cyber risks provides holistic and system-level solutions. This chapter starts with a systemic view toward cyber risks and presents the confluence of game theory, control theory, and learning theories, which are three major pillars for the design of cyber resilience mechanisms to counteract increasingly sophisticated and evolving threats in our networks and organizations. Game and control theoretic methods provide a set of modeling frameworks to capture the strategic and dynamic interactions between defenders and attackers. Control and learning frameworks together provide a feedback-driven mechanism that enables autonomous and adaptive responses to threats. Game and learning frameworks offer a data-driven approach to proactively reason about adversarial behaviors and resilient strategies. The confluence of the three lays the theoretical foundations for the analysis and design of cyber resilience. This chapter presents various theoretical paradigms, including dynamic asymmetric games, moving horizon control, conjectural learning, and meta-learning, as recent advances at the intersection. This chapter concludes with future directions and discussions of the role of neurosymbolic learning and the synergy between foundation models and game models in cyber resilience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bootstrapping SparseFormers from Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01987v2)** | 2024-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently proposed SparseFormer architecture provides an alternative approach to visual understanding by utilizing a significantly lower number of visual tokens via adjusting RoIs, greatly reducing computational costs while still achieving promising performance. However, training SparseFormers from scratch is still expensive, and scaling up the number of parameters can be challenging. In this paper, we propose to bootstrap SparseFormers from ViT-based vision foundation models in a simple and efficient way. Since the majority of SparseFormer blocks are the standard transformer ones, we can inherit weights from large-scale pre-trained vision transformers and freeze them as much as possible. Therefore, we only need to train the SparseFormer-specific lightweight focusing transformer to adjust token RoIs and fine-tune a few early pre-trained blocks to align the final token representation. In such a way, we can bootstrap SparseFormer architectures from various large-scale pre-trained models (e.g., IN-21K pre-trained AugRegs or CLIPs) using a rather smaller amount of training samples (e.g., IN-1K) and without labels or captions within just a few hours. As a result, the bootstrapped unimodal SparseFormer (from AugReg-ViT-L/16-384) can reach 84.9% accuracy on IN-1K with only 49 tokens, and the multimodal SparseFormer from CLIPs also demonstrates notable zero-shot performance with highly reduced computational cost without seeing any caption during the bootstrapping procedure. In addition, CLIP-bootstrapped SparseFormers, which align the output space with language without seeing a word, can serve as efficient vision encoders in multimodal large language models.

It promotes the development of healthcare artificial intelligence (AI) models, breaking the contradiction between limited AI models and diverse healthcare practices. Much more widespread healthcare scenarios will benefit from the development of a healthcare foundation model (HFM), improving their advanced intelligent healthcare services. Despite the impending widespread deployment of HFMs, there is currently a lack of clear understanding about how they work in the healthcare field, their current challenges, and where they are headed in the future. To answer these questions, a comprehensive and deep survey of the challenges, opportunities, and future directions of HFMs is presented in this survey. It first conducted a comprehensive overview of the HFM including the methods, data, and applications for a quick grasp of the current progress. Then, it made an in-depth exploration of the challenges present in data, algorithms, and computing infrastructures for constructing and widespread application of foundation models in healthcare. This survey also identifies emerging and promising directions in this field for future development. We believe that this survey will enhance the community's comprehension of the current progress of HFM and serve as a valuable source of guidance for future development in this field.

However, current state-of-the-art models employ spatio-temporal transformers trained on limited amounts of data, hindering generalizability adaptation to downstream tasks. The benefits of vision foundation models present a potential solution to improve the VSP process. However, adapting image foundation models to the video domain presents significant challenges in modeling scene dynamics and capturing temporal information. To address these challenges, and as the first initiative to design a VSP model based on video foundation models, we introduce SalFoM, a novel encoder-decoder video transformer architecture. Our model employs UnMasked Teacher (UMT) as feature extractor and presents a heterogeneous decoder which features a locality-aware spatio-temporal transformer and integrates local and global spatio-temporal information from various perspectives to produce the final saliency map. Our qualitative and quantitative experiments on the challenging VSP benchmark datasets of DHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports demonstrate the superiority of our proposed model in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

Zero-shot object 6D pose estimation methods address this challenge by leveraging additional task-specific supervision provided by large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic datasets. However, their performance heavily depends on the quality and diversity of rendered data and they require extensive training. In this work, we show how to tackle the same task but without training on specific data. We propose FreeZe, a novel solution that harnesses the capabilities of pre-trained geometric and vision foundation models. FreeZe leverages 3D geometric descriptors learned from unrelated 3D point clouds and 2D visual features learned from web-scale 2D images to generate discriminative 3D point-level descriptors. We then estimate the 6D pose of unseen objects by 3D registration based on RANSAC. We also introduce a novel algorithm to solve ambiguous cases due to geometrically symmetric objects that is based on visual features. We comprehensively evaluate FreeZe across the seven core datasets of the BOP Benchmark, which include over a hundred 3D objects and 20,000 images captured in various scenarios. FreeZe consistently outperforms all state-of-the-art approaches, including competitors extensively trained on synthetic 6D pose estimation data.

In this paper, we propose for the first time the use of Transformer neural networks, with a Masked Auto-Encoder architecture, as Foundation Models for SHM. We demonstrate the ability of these models to learn generalizable representations from multiple large datasets through self-supervised pre-training, which, coupled with task-specific fine-tuning, allows them to outperform state-of-the-art traditional methods on diverse tasks, including Anomaly Detection (AD) and Traffic Load Estimation (TLE). We then extensively explore model size versus accuracy trade-offs and experiment with Knowledge Distillation (KD) to improve the performance of smaller Transformers, enabling their embedding directly into the SHM edge nodes. We showcase the effectiveness of our foundation models using data from three operational viaducts. For AD, we achieve a near-perfect 99.9% accuracy with a monitoring time span of just 15 windows. In contrast, a state-of-the-art method based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) obtains its first good result (95.03% accuracy) only considering 120 windows. On two different TLE tasks, our models obtain state-of-the-art performance on multiple evaluation metrics (R$^2$ score, MAE% and MSE%). On the first benchmark, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.97 and 0.85 for light and heavy vehicle traffic, respectively, while the best previous approach stops at 0.91 and 0.84. On the second one, we achieve an R$^2$ score of 0.54 versus the 0.10 of the best existing method.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 tables, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[On the Efficiency and Robustness of Vibration-based Foundation Models for IoT Sensing: A Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02461v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper demonstrates the potential of vibration-based Foundation Models (FMs), pre-trained with unlabeled sensing data, to improve the robustness of run-time inference in (a class of) IoT applications. A case study is presented featuring a vehicle classification application using acoustic and seismic sensing. The work is motivated by the success of foundation models in the areas of natural language processing and computer vision, leading to generalizations of the FM concept to other domains as well, where significant amounts of unlabeled data exist that can be used for self-supervised pre-training. One such domain is IoT applications. Foundation models for selected sensing modalities in the IoT domain can be pre-trained in an environment-agnostic fashion using available unlabeled sensor data and then fine-tuned to the deployment at hand using a small amount of labeled data. The paper shows that the pre-training/fine-tuning approach improves the robustness of downstream inference and facilitates adaptation to different environmental conditions. More specifically, we present a case study in a real-world setting to evaluate a simple (vibration-based) FM-like model, called FOCAL, demonstrating its superior robustness and adaptation, compared to conventional supervised deep neural networks (DNNs). We also demonstrate its superior convergence over supervised solutions. Our findings highlight the advantages of vibration-based FMs (and FM-inspired selfsupervised models in general) in terms of inference robustness, runtime efficiency, and model adaptation (via fine-tuning) in resource-limited IoT settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Responsible Generative AI: A Reference Architecture for Designing Foundation Model based Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13148v3)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs), have been widely recognised as transformative AI technologies due to their capabilities to understand and generate content, including plans with reasoning capabilities. Foundation model based agents derive their autonomy from the capabilities of foundation models, which enable them to autonomously break down a given goal into a set of manageable tasks and orchestrate task execution to meet the goal. Despite the huge efforts put into building foundation model based agents, the architecture design of the agents has not yet been systematically explored. Also, while there are significant benefits of using agents for planning and execution, there are serious considerations regarding responsible AI related software quality attributes, such as security and accountability. Therefore, this paper presents a pattern-oriented reference architecture that serves as guidance when designing foundation model based agents. We evaluate the completeness and utility of the proposed reference architecture by mapping it to the architecture of two real-world agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decision Transformer as a Foundation Model for Partially Observable Continuous Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02407v1)** | 2024-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Closed-loop control of nonlinear dynamical systems with partial-state observability demands expert knowledge of a diverse, less standardized set of theoretical tools. Moreover, it requires a delicate integration of controller and estimator designs to achieve the desired system behavior. To establish a general controller synthesis framework, we explore the Decision Transformer (DT) architecture. Specifically, we first frame the control task as predicting the current optimal action based on past observations, actions, and rewards, eliminating the need for a separate estimator design. Then, we leverage the pre-trained language models, i.e., the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series, to initialize DT and subsequently train it for control tasks using low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Our comprehensive experiments across five distinct control tasks, ranging from maneuvering aerospace systems to controlling partial differential equations (PDEs), demonstrate DT's capability to capture the parameter-agnostic structures intrinsic to control tasks. DT exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization abilities for completely new tasks and rapidly surpasses expert performance levels with a minimal amount of demonstration data. These findings highlight the potential of DT as a foundational controller for general control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CDC 2024</p></details> |

In this study, we explore the adaptation of these models for few-shot semantic segmentation. Specifically, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of four prominent foundation models: DINO V2, Segment Anything, CLIP, Masked AutoEncoders, and of a straightforward ResNet50 pre-trained on the COCO dataset. We also include 5 adaptation methods, ranging from linear probing to fine tuning. Our findings show that DINO V2 outperforms other models by a large margin, across various datasets and adaptation methods. On the other hand, adaptation methods provide little discrepancy in the obtained results, suggesting that a simple linear probing can compete with advanced, more computationally intensive, alternatives</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot Safety Prediction for Autonomous Robots with Foundation World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00462v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A world model creates a surrogate world to train a controller and predict safety violations by learning the internal dynamic model of systems. However, the existing world models rely solely on statistical learning of how observations change in response to actions, lacking precise quantification of how accurate the surrogate dynamics are, which poses a significant challenge in safety-critical systems. To address this challenge, we propose foundation world models that embed observations into meaningful and causally latent representations. This enables the surrogate dynamics to directly predict causal future states by leveraging a training-free large language model. In two common benchmarks, this novel model outperforms standard world models in the safety prediction task and has a performance comparable to supervised learning despite not using any data. We evaluate its performance with a more specialized and system-relevant metric by comparing estimated states instead of aggregating observation-wide error.</p></details> |  |
| **[IsoBench: Benchmarking Multimodal Foundation Models on Isomorphic Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01266v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current foundation models exhibit impressive capabilities when prompted either with text only or with both image and text inputs. But do their capabilities change depending on the input modality? In this work, we propose $\textbf{IsoBench}$, a benchmark dataset containing problems from four major areas: math, science, algorithms, and games. Each example is presented with multiple $\textbf{isomorphic representations}$ of inputs, such as visual, textual, and mathematical presentations. IsoBench provides fine-grained feedback to diagnose performance gaps caused by the form of the representation. Across various foundation models, we observe that on the same problem, models have a consistent preference towards textual representations. Most prominently, when evaluated on all IsoBench problems, Claude-3 Opus performs 28.7 points worse when provided with images instead of text; similarly, GPT-4 Turbo is 18.7 points worse and Gemini Pro is 14.9 points worse. Finally, we present two prompting techniques, $\textit{IsoCombination}$ and $\textit{IsoScratchPad}$, which improve model performance by considering combinations of, and translations between, different input representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Models for Time Series Analysis: A Tutorial and Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14735v2)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Time series analysis stands as a focal point within the data mining community, serving as a cornerstone for extracting valuable insights crucial to a myriad of real-world applications. Recent advancements in Foundation Models (FMs) have fundamentally reshaped the paradigm of model design for time series analysis, boosting various downstream tasks in practice. These innovative approaches often leverage pre-trained or fine-tuned FMs to harness generalized knowledge tailored specifically for time series analysis. In this survey, we aim to furnish a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of FMs for time series analysis. While prior surveys have predominantly focused on either the application or the pipeline aspects of FMs in time series analysis, they have often lacked an in-depth understanding of the underlying mechanisms that elucidate why and how FMs benefit time series analysis. To address this gap, our survey adopts a model-centric classification, delineating various pivotal elements of time-series FMs, including model architectures, pre-training techniques, adaptation methods, and data modalities. Overall, this survey serves to consolidate the latest advancements in FMs pertinent to time series analysis, accentuating their theoretical underpinnings, recent strides in development, and avenues for future research exploration.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies primarily focused on the quality of FMs evaluated by GPT-4 or their ability to pass medical exams, no studies have quantified the extent of self-diagnostic atomic knowledge stored in FMs' memory, which is the basis of foundation models to provide factual and reliable suggestions. In this paper, we first constructed a benchmark of Self-diagnostic Atomic Knowledge (SdAK), including the most common types of atomic knowledge involved in self-diagnostic queries, with 17 atomic types and a total of 14, 048 pieces of atomic knowledge. Then, we evaluated both generic and open-source Chinese medical FMs on the benchmark. The experimental results showcase that generic FMs perform better than medical FMs in terms of self-diagnostic atomic knowledge. Error analysis revealed that both generic and medical FMs are sycophantic, e.g., always catering to users' claims when it comes to unknown knowledge. We further explored different types of data commonly adopted for fine-tuning medical FMs, i.e., real-world, semi-distilled, and distilled data, and found that distilled data can benefit FMs most.

The emergence of foundation models (FMs) offers potential solutions to the limitations of existing FL frameworks, e.g., by generating synthetic data for model initialization. However, due to the inherent safety concerns of FMs, integrating FMs into FL could introduce new risks, which remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we conduct the first investigation on the vulnerability of FM integrated FL (FM-FL) under adversarial threats. Based on a unified framework of FM-FL, we introduce a novel attack strategy that exploits safety issues of FM to compromise FL client models. Through extensive experiments with well-known models and benchmark datasets in both image and text domains, we reveal the high susceptibility of the FM-FL to this new threat under various FL configurations. Furthermore, we find that existing FL defense strategies offer limited protection against this novel attack approach. This research highlights the critical need for enhanced security measures in FL in the era of FMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chen ...</summary><p>Chen Wu and Xi Li are equal contribution.

Recently, it was shown that ensembles of neural networks observe the phenomena ``agreement-on-the-line'', which can be leveraged to reliably predict OOD performance without labels. However, in contrast to classical neural networks that are trained on in-distribution data from scratch for numerous epochs, foundation models undergo minimal finetuning from heavily pretrained weights, which may reduce the ensemble diversity needed to observe agreement-on-the-line. In our work, we demonstrate that when lightly finetuning multiple runs from a $\textit{single}$ foundation model, the choice of randomness during training (linear head initialization, data ordering, and data subsetting) can lead to drastically different levels of agreement-on-the-line in the resulting ensemble. Surprisingly, only random head initialization is able to reliably induce agreement-on-the-line in finetuned foundation models across vision and language benchmarks. Second, we demonstrate that ensembles of $\textit{multiple}$ foundation models pretrained on different datasets but finetuned on the same task can also show agreement-on-the-line. In total, by careful construction of a diverse ensemble, we can utilize agreement-on-the-line-based methods to predict the OOD performance of foundation models with high precision.</p></details> |  |

Unlike current general-purpose foundation models that are stuck in the dilemma of inferior quality and text-image misalignment for humans, CosmicMan enables generating photo-realistic human images with meticulous appearance, reasonable structure, and precise text-image alignment with detailed dense descriptions. At the heart of CosmicMan's success are the new reflections and perspectives on data and models: (1) We found that data quality and a scalable data production flow are essential for the final results from trained models. Hence, we propose a new data production paradigm, Annotate Anyone, which serves as a perpetual data flywheel to produce high-quality data with accurate yet cost-effective annotations over time. Based on this, we constructed a large-scale dataset, CosmicMan-HQ 1.0, with 6 Million high-quality real-world human images in a mean resolution of 1488x1255, and attached with precise text annotations deriving from 115 Million attributes in diverse granularities. (2) We argue that a text-to-image foundation model specialized for humans must be pragmatic -- easy to integrate into down-streaming tasks while effective in producing high-quality human images. Hence, we propose to model the relationship between dense text descriptions and image pixels in a decomposed manner, and present Decomposed-Attention-Refocusing (Daring) training framework. It seamlessly decomposes the cross-attention features in existing text-to-image diffusion model, and enforces attention refocusing without adding extra modules. Through Daring, we show that explicitly discretizing continuous text space into several basic groups that align with human body structure is the key to tackling the misalignment problem in a breeze.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2024.

Recognizing this, we present msGFM, a multisensor geospatial foundation model that effectively unifies data from four key sensor modalities. This integration spans an expansive dataset of two million multisensor images. msGFM is uniquely adept at handling both paired and unpaired sensor data. For data originating from identical geolocations, our model employs an innovative cross-sensor pretraining approach in masked image modeling, enabling the synthesis of joint representations from diverse sensors. msGFM, incorporating four remote sensors, upholds strong performance, forming a comprehensive model adaptable to various sensor types. msGFM has demonstrated enhanced proficiency in a range of both single-sensor and multisensor downstream tasks. These include scene classification, segmentation, cloud removal, and pan-sharpening. A key discovery of our research is that representations derived from natural images are not always compatible with the distinct characteristics of geospatial remote sensors, underscoring the limitations of existing representations in this field. Our work can serve as a guide for developing multisensor geospatial pretraining models, paving the way for more advanced geospatial capabilities.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR |
| **[Asymmetric Masked Distillation for Pre-Training Small Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03149v2)** | 2024-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised foundation models have shown great potential in computer vision thanks to the pre-training paradigm of masked autoencoding. Scale is a primary factor influencing the performance of these foundation models. However, these large foundation models often result in high computational cost. This paper focuses on pre-training relatively small vision transformer models that could be efficiently adapted to downstream tasks. Specifically, taking inspiration from knowledge distillation in model compression, we propose a new asymmetric masked distillation (AMD) framework for pre-training relatively small models with autoencoding. The core of AMD is to devise an asymmetric masking strategy, where the teacher model is enabled to see more context information with a lower masking ratio, while the student model is still equipped with a high masking ratio. We design customized multi-layer feature alignment between the teacher encoder and student encoder to regularize the pre-training of student MAE. To demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of AMD, we apply it to both ImageMAE and VideoMAE for pre-training relatively small ViT models. AMD achieved 84.6% classification accuracy on IN1K using the ViT-B model. And AMD achieves 73.3% classification accuracy using the ViT-B model on the Something-in-Something V2 dataset, a 3.7% improvement over the original ViT-B model from VideoMAE. We also transfer AMD pre-trained models to downstream tasks and obtain consistent performance improvement over the original masked autoencoding.

In addition to characterizing how these models understand and reason with natural language, we also investigate how well they comprehend cultural practices, nuances, and values. Alongside standard accuracy metrics, we investigate the brittleness of foundation models in the dimensions of semantics and multilinguality. Our analyses span both open-sourced and closed models, leading to empirical results across classic NLP tasks, reasoning, and cultural comprehension. Key findings indicate (1) Most models exhibit varied behavior when given paraphrased instructions. (2) Many models still suffer from exposure bias (e.g., positional bias, majority label bias). (3) For questions rooted in factual, scientific, and commonsense knowledge, consistent responses are expected across multilingual queries that are semantically equivalent. Yet, most models surprisingly demonstrate inconsistent performance on these queries. (4) Multilingually-trained models have not attained "balanced multilingual" capabilities. Our endeavors underscore the need for more generalizable semantic representations and enhanced multilingual contextualization.

| **[Image-to-Image Matching via Foundation Models: A New Perspective for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00262v1)** | 2024-03-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS) aims to segment images of arbitrary categories specified by class labels or captions. However, most previous best-performing methods, whether pixel grouping methods or region recognition methods, suffer from false matches between image features and category labels. We attribute this to the natural gap between the textual features and visual features. In this work, we rethink how to mitigate false matches from the perspective of image-to-image matching and propose a novel relation-aware intra-modal matching (RIM) framework for OVS based on visual foundation models. RIM achieves robust region classification by firstly constructing diverse image-modal reference features and then matching them with region features based on relation-aware ranking distribution. The proposed RIM enjoys several merits. First, the intra-modal reference features are better aligned, circumventing potential ambiguities that may arise in cross-modal matching. Second, the ranking-based matching process harnesses the structure information implicit in the inter-class relationships, making it more robust than comparing individually. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that RIM outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by large margins, obtaining a lead of more than 10% in mIoU on PASCAL VOC benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted to CVPR2024 |

Many existing foundation models benefit from the generalization capability of contrastive self-supervised learning by learning compact and high-quality representations without relying on any label information. Amidst the explosive advancements in foundation models across multiple domains, including natural language processing and computer vision, a thorough survey on heterogeneous contrastive learning for the foundation model is urgently needed. In response, this survey critically evaluates the current landscape of heterogeneous contrastive learning for foundation models, highlighting the open challenges and future trends of contrastive learning. In particular, we first present how the recent advanced contrastive learning-based methods deal with view heterogeneity and how contrastive learning is applied to train and fine-tune the multi-view foundation models. Then, we move to contrastive learning methods for task heterogeneity, including pretraining tasks and downstream tasks, and show how different tasks are combined with contrastive learning loss for different purposes. Finally, we conclude this survey by discussing the open challenges and shedding light on the future directions of contrastive learning.</p></details> |  |

Existing DGSS methods typically effectuate robust features by means of Domain Randomization (DR). Such an approach is often limited as it can only account for style diversification and not content. In this work, we take an orthogonal approach to DGSS and propose to use an assembly of CoLlaborative FOUndation models for Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (CLOUDS). In detail, CLOUDS is a framework that integrates FMs of various kinds: (i) CLIP backbone for its robust feature representation, (ii) generative models to diversify the content, thereby covering various modes of the possible target distribution, and (iii) Segment Anything Model (SAM) for iteratively refining the predictions of the segmentation model. Extensive experiments show that our CLOUDS excels in adapting from synthetic to real DGSS benchmarks and under varying weather conditions, notably outperforming prior methods by 5.6% and 6.7% on averaged miou, respectively.

Of particular interest is the 2B parameter Gemma model, which provides opportunities to construct capable small-scale MMFMs. In line with findings from other papers in this space, we test the effect of ablating three design features: pretraining the connector, utilizing a more powerful image backbone, and increasing the size of the language backbone. The resulting models, which we call LLaVA-Gemma, exhibit moderate performance on an array of evaluations, but fail to improve past the current comparably sized SOTA models. Closer analysis of performance shows mixed effects; skipping pretraining tends to reduce performance, larger vision models sometimes improve performance, and increasing language model size has inconsistent effects. We publicly release training recipes, code and weights for our models for the LLaVA-Gemma models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Authors 1 and 2 contributed equally.

| **[Mixed-precision Supernet Training from Vision Foundation Models using Low Rank Adapter](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.20080v1)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compression of large and performant vision foundation models (VFMs) into arbitrary bit-wise operations (BitOPs) allows their deployment on various hardware. We propose to fine-tune a VFM to a mixed-precision quantized supernet. The supernet-based neural architecture search (NAS) can be adopted for this purpose, which trains a supernet, and then subnets within arbitrary hardware budgets can be extracted. However, existing methods face difficulties in optimizing the mixed-precision search space and incurring large memory costs during training. To tackle these challenges, first, we study the effective search space design for fine-tuning a VFM by comparing different operators (such as resolution, feature size, width, depth, and bit-widths) in terms of performance and BitOPs reduction. Second, we propose memory-efficient supernet training using a low-rank adapter (LoRA) and a progressive training strategy. The proposed method is evaluated for the recently proposed VFM, Segment Anything Model, fine-tuned on segmentation tasks. The searched model yields about a 95% reduction in BitOPs without incurring performance degradation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lens: A Foundation Model for Network Traffic in Cybersecurity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03646v3)** | 2024-03-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Network traffic refers to the amount of data being sent and received over the internet or any system that connects computers. Analyzing and understanding network traffic is vital for improving network security and management. However, the analysis of network traffic is challenging due to the diverse nature of data packets, which often feature heterogeneous headers and encrypted payloads lacking semantics. To capture the latent semantics of traffic, a few studies have adopted pre-training techniques based on the Transformer encoder or decoder to learn the representations from massive traffic data. However, these methods typically excel in traffic understanding (classification) or traffic generation tasks. To address this issue, we develop Lens, a foundation model for network traffic that leverages the T5 architecture to learn the pre-trained representations from large-scale unlabeled data. Harnessing the strength of the encoder-decoder framework, which captures the global information while preserving the generative ability, our model can better learn the representations from raw data. To further enhance pre-training effectiveness, we design a novel loss that combines three distinct tasks: Masked Span Prediction (MSP), Packet Order Prediction (POP), and Homologous Traffic Prediction (HTP). Evaluation results across various benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed Lens outperforms the baselines in most downstream tasks related to both traffic understanding and generation. Notably, it also requires much less labeled data for fine-tuning compared to current methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating the Emergent Audio Classification Ability of ASR Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09363v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text and vision foundation models can perform many tasks in a zero-shot setting, a desirable property that enables these systems to be applied in general and low-resource settings. There has been far less work, however, on the zero-shot abilities of ASR foundation models, with these systems typically fine-tuned to specific tasks or constrained to applications that match their training criterion and data annotation. In this work we investigate the ability of Whisper and MMS, ASR foundation models trained primarily for speech recognition, to perform zero-shot audio classification. We use simple template-based text prompts at the decoder and use the resulting decoding probabilities to generate zero-shot predictions. Without training the model on extra data or adding any new parameters, we demonstrate that Whisper shows promising zero-shot classification performance on a range of 8 audio-classification datasets, outperforming the accuracy of existing state-of-the-art zero-shot baselines by an average of 9%. One important step to unlock the emergent ability is debiasing, where a simple unsupervised reweighting method of the class probabilities yields consistent significant performance gains. We further show that performance increases with model size, implying that as ASR foundation models scale up, they may exhibit improved zero-shot performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>NAACL...</summary><p>NAACL 2024 (main conference)</p></details> |
| **[Brant-2: Foundation Model for Brain Signals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10251v4)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational models benefit from pre-training on large amounts of unlabeled data and enable strong performance in a wide variety of applications with a small amount of labeled data. Such models can be particularly effective in analyzing brain signals, as this field encompasses numerous application scenarios, and it is costly to perform large-scale annotation. In this work, we present the largest foundation model in brain signals, Brant-2. Compared to Brant, a foundation model designed for intracranial neural signals, Brant-2 not only exhibits robustness towards data variations and modeling scales but also can be applied to a broader range of brain neural data. By experimenting on an extensive range of tasks, we demonstrate that Brant-2 is adaptive to various application scenarios in brain signals. Further analyses reveal the scalability of the Brant-2, validate each component's effectiveness, and showcase our model's ability to maintain performance in scenarios with scarce labels.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

In this context, a variety of GNNs have emerged as promising methodologies for encoding the structural information of graphs. By effectively capturing the graph's underlying structure, these GNNs have shown great potential in enhancing performance in graph learning tasks, such as link prediction and node classification. However, despite their successes, a significant challenge persists: these advanced methods often face difficulties in generalizing to unseen graph data that significantly differs from the training instances. In this work, our aim is to advance the graph learning paradigm by developing a general graph foundation model. This model is designed to understand the complex topological patterns present in diverse graph data, enabling it to excel in zero-shot graph learning tasks across different downstream datasets. To achieve this goal, we address several key technical challenges in our OpenGraph model. Firstly, we propose a unified graph tokenizer to adapt our graph model to generalize well on unseen graph data, even when the underlying graph properties differ significantly from those encountered during training. Secondly, we develop a scalable graph transformer as the foundational encoder, which effectively captures node-wise dependencies within the global topological context. Thirdly, we introduce a data augmentation mechanism enhanced by a LLM to alleviate the limitations of data scarcity in real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our framework. By adapting our OpenGraph to new graph characteristics and comprehending the nuances of diverse graphs, our approach achieves remarkable zero-shot graph learning performance across various settings and domains.</p></details> |  |

Despite numerous proposals, process science lacks an adequate understanding of the core concepts of the field, including notions such as process, event, and system. A more systematic framework to cope with process science is mandatory. We suggest such a framework using an example. The framework itself addresses three aspects: architecture, statics, and dynamics. Corresponding formal concepts, based on established scientific theories, together provide an integrated framework for understanding processes in the world. We argue that our foundations have positive implications not only for theoretical research, but also for empirical research, e.g., because hypothesized relationships can be explicitly tested. It is now time to start a discussion about the foundations of our field.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, submitted to 19th International Conference on Wirtschaftsinformatik 2024. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2203.09602</p></details> |
| **[Dual-Personalizing Adapter for Federated Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19211v1)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, foundation models, particularly large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated an impressive ability to adapt to various tasks by fine-tuning large amounts of instruction data. Notably, federated foundation models emerge as a privacy preservation method to fine-tune models collaboratively under federated learning (FL) settings by leveraging many distributed datasets with non-IID data. To alleviate communication and computation overhead, parameter-efficient methods are introduced for efficiency, and some research adapted personalization methods to federated foundation models for better user preferences alignment. However, a critical gap in existing research is the neglect of test-time distribution shifts in real-world applications. Therefore, to bridge this gap, we propose a new setting, termed test-time personalization, which not only concentrates on the targeted local task but also extends to other tasks that exhibit test-time distribution shifts. To address challenges in this new setting, we explore a simple yet effective solution to learn a comprehensive foundation model. Specifically, a dual-personalizing adapter architecture (FedDPA) is proposed, comprising a global adapter and a local adapter for addressing test-time distribution shifts and personalization, respectively. Additionally, we introduce an instance-wise dynamic weighting mechanism to optimize the balance between the global and local adapters, enhancing overall performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been evaluated on benchmark datasets across different NLP tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FluoroSAM: A Language-aligned Foundation Model for X-ray Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08059v2)** | 2024-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated X-ray image segmentation would accelerate research and development in diagnostic and interventional precision medicine. Prior efforts have contributed task-specific models capable of solving specific image analysis problems, but the utility of these models is restricted to their particular task domain, and expanding to broader use requires additional data, labels, and retraining efforts. Recently, foundation models (FMs) -- machine learning models trained on large amounts of highly variable data thus enabling broad applicability -- have emerged as promising tools for automated image analysis. Existing FMs for medical image analysis focus on scenarios and modalities where objects are clearly defined by visually apparent boundaries, such as surgical tool segmentation in endoscopy. X-ray imaging, by contrast, does not generally offer such clearly delineated boundaries or structure priors. During X-ray image formation, complex 3D structures are projected in transmission onto the imaging plane, resulting in overlapping features of varying opacity and shape. To pave the way toward an FM for comprehensive and automated analysis of arbitrary medical X-ray images, we develop FluoroSAM, a language-aligned variant of the Segment-Anything Model, trained from scratch on 1.6M synthetic X-ray images. FluoroSAM is trained on data including masks for 128 organ types and 464 non-anatomical objects, such as tools and implants. In real X-ray images of cadaveric specimens, FluoroSAM is able to segment bony anatomical structures based on text-only prompting with 0.51 and 0.79 DICE with point-based refinement, outperforming competing SAM variants for all structures. FluoroSAM is also capable of zero-shot generalization to segmenting classes beyond the training set thanks to its language alignment, which we demonstrate for full lung segmentation on real chest X-rays.</p></details> |  |

Unlike distributed learning frameworks such as federated learning, which often struggle with multimodal data, FMs can transform diverse inputs into embeddings. This process facilitates the integration of information from various modalities and the application of prior learning to new domains. However, deploying FMs in resource-constrained edge systems poses significant challenges. To this end, we introduce CoRAST, a novel learning framework that utilizes FMs for enhanced analysis of distributed, correlated heterogeneous data. Utilizing a server-based FM, CoRAST can exploit existing environment information to extract temporal, spatial, and cross-modal correlations among sensor data. This enables CoRAST to offer context-aware insights for localized client tasks through FM-powered global representation learning. Our evaluation on real-world weather dataset demonstrates CoRAST's ability to exploit correlated heterogeneous data through environmental representation learning to reduce the forecast errors by up to 50.3% compared to the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted and to be published in 2024 IEEE International Workshop on Foundation Models for Cyber-Physical Systems & Internet of Things (FMSys)</p></details> |
| **[FoMo-Bench: a multi-modal, multi-scale and multi-task Forest Monitoring Benchmark for remote sensing foundation models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10114v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forests are an essential part of Earth's ecosystems and natural systems, as well as providing services on which humanity depends, yet they are rapidly changing as a result of land use decisions and climate change. Understanding and mitigating negative effects requires parsing data on forests at global scale from a broad array of sensory modalities, and recently many such problems have been approached using machine learning algorithms for remote sensing. To date, forest-monitoring problems have largely been addressed in isolation. Inspired by the rise of foundation models for computer vision and remote sensing, we here present the first unified Forest Monitoring Benchmark (FoMo-Bench). FoMo-Bench consists of 15 diverse datasets encompassing satellite, aerial, and inventory data, covering a variety of geographical regions, and including multispectral, red-green-blue, synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and LiDAR data with various temporal, spatial and spectral resolutions. FoMo-Bench includes multiple types of forest-monitoring tasks, spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection. To further enhance the diversity of tasks and geographies represented in FoMo-Bench, we introduce a novel global dataset, TalloS, combining satellite imagery with ground-based annotations for tree species classification, encompassing 1,000+ categories across multiple hierarchical taxonomic levels (species, genus, family). Finally, we propose FoMo-Net, a baseline foundation model with the capacity to process any combination of commonly used spectral bands in remote sensing, across diverse ground sampling distances and geographical locations worldwide. This work aims to inspire research collaborations between machine learning and forest biology researchers in exploring scalable multi-modal and multi-task models for forest monitoring. All code and data will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Foundation Model Makes Clustering A Better Initialization For Cold-Start Active Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02561v2)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active learning selects the most informative samples from the unlabelled dataset to annotate in the context of a limited annotation budget. While numerous methods have been proposed for subsequent sample selection based on an initialized model, scant attention has been paid to the indispensable phase of active learning: selecting samples for model cold-start initialization. Most of the previous studies resort to random sampling or naive clustering. However, random sampling is prone to fluctuation, and naive clustering suffers from convergence speed, particularly when dealing with high-dimensional data such as imaging data. In this work, we propose to integrate foundation models with clustering methods to select samples for cold-start active learning initialization. Foundation models refer to those trained on massive datasets by the self-supervised paradigm and capable of generating informative and compacted embeddings for various downstream tasks. Leveraging these embeddings to replace raw features such as pixel values, clustering quickly converges and identifies better initial samples. For a comprehensive comparison, we included a classic ImageNet-supervised model to acquire embeddings. Experiments on two clinical tasks of image classification and segmentation demonstrated that foundation model-based clustering efficiently pinpointed informative initial samples, leading to models showcasing enhanced performance than the baseline methods. We envisage that this study provides an effective paradigm for future cold-start active learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Logit Adjustment: Calibrating Fine-tuned Models by Removing Label Bias in Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08106v3)** | 2024-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models like CLIP allow zero-shot transfer on various tasks without additional training data. Yet, the zero-shot performance is less competitive than a fully supervised one. Thus, to enhance the performance, fine-tuning and ensembling are also commonly adopted to better fit the downstream tasks. However, we argue that such prior work has overlooked the inherent biases in foundation models. Due to the highly imbalanced Web-scale training set, these foundation models are inevitably skewed toward frequent semantics, and thus the subsequent fine-tuning or ensembling is still biased. In this study, we systematically examine the biases in foundation models and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed Generalized Logit Adjustment (GLA) method. Note that bias estimation in foundation models is challenging, as most pre-train data cannot be explicitly accessed like in traditional long-tailed classification tasks. To this end, GLA has an optimization-based bias estimation approach for debiasing foundation models. As our work resolves a fundamental flaw in the pre-training, the proposed GLA demonstrates significant improvements across a diverse range of tasks: it achieves 1.5 pp accuracy gains on ImageNet, an large average improvement (1.4-4.6 pp) on 11 few-shot datasets, 2.4 pp gains on long-tailed classification.

Nevertheless these methods are computationally expensive to train, introduce additional complexity and may require domain knowledge to adapt hyper-parameters to a new dataset. Inspired by developments in object detection, segmentation and large-scale self-supervised foundation vision models, we introduce Component Features (ComFe), a novel explainable-by-design image classification approach using a transformer-decoder head and hierarchical mixture-modelling. With only global image labels and no segmentation or part annotations, ComFe can identify consistent image components, such as the head, body, wings and tail of a bird, and the image background, and determine which of these features are informative in making a prediction. We demonstrate that ComFe obtains higher accuracy compared to previous interpretable models across a range of fine-grained vision benchmarks, without the need to individually tune hyper-parameters for each dataset. We also show that ComFe outperforms a non-interpretable linear head across a range of datasets, including ImageNet, and improves performance on generalisation and robustness benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The narrative and unstructured nature of clinical notes is a major obstacle for healthcare intelligentization. We address a critical problem of structuring clinical notes into clinical data, according to international interoperability standards. We collect and annotate data for three subtasks, namely, international patient summary, clinical impression and medical encounter. We then supervised fine-tuned a state-of-the-art LLM using public and credentialed clinical data. The training is orchestrated in a way that the target model can first support basic clinical tasks such as abbreviation expansion and temporal information extraction, and then learn to perform more complex downstream clinical tasks. Moreover, we address several modeling challenges in the healthcare context, e.g., extra long context window. Our blind pairwise evaluation shows that SoftTiger outperforms other popular open-source models and GPT-3.5, comparable to Gemini-pro, with a mild gap from GPT-4. We believe that LLMs may become a step-stone towards healthcare digitalization and democratization. Therefore, we publicly release SoftTiger models at scales of 13 billion and 70 billion parameters, as well as datasets and code for our innovative scalable evaluation, hopefully, making a significant contribution to the healthcare industry.</p></details> |  |
| **[Batched Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05677v2)** | 2024-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained attention for fine-tuning foundation models by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. While LoRA offers numerous advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request. To mitigate this constraint, we introduce Fast LoRA (FLoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests. We empirically demonstrate that FLoRA retains the performance merits of LoRA, showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6 languages.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

However, the scarcity of such data presents a significant hurdle to extending these methods to general use cases. To address this concern, we present an automated framework to decompose trajectory data into temporally bounded and natural language-based descriptive sub-tasks by leveraging recent prompting strategies for Foundation Models (FMs) including both Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). Our framework provides both time-based and language-based descriptions for lower-level sub-tasks that comprise full trajectories. To rigorously evaluate the quality of our automatic labeling framework, we contribute an algorithm SIMILARITY to produce two novel metrics, temporal similarity and semantic similarity. The metrics measure the temporal alignment and semantic fidelity of language descriptions between two sub-task decompositions, namely an FM sub-task decomposition prediction and a ground-truth sub-task decomposition. We present scores for temporal similarity and semantic similarity above 90%, compared to 30% of a randomized baseline, for multiple robotic environments, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed framework. Our results enable building diverse, large-scale, language-supervised datasets for improved robotic TAMP.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures.

Automatic chart understanding has witnessed significant advancements with the rise of large foundation models in recent years. Foundation models, such as large language models, have revolutionized various natural language processing tasks and are increasingly being applied to chart understanding tasks. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent developments, challenges, and future directions in chart understanding within the context of these foundation models. We review fundamental building blocks crucial for studying chart understanding tasks. Additionally, we explore various tasks and their evaluation metrics and sources of both charts and textual inputs. Various modeling strategies are then examined, encompassing both classification-based and generation-based approaches, along with tool augmentation techniques that enhance chart understanding performance. Furthermore, we discuss the state-of-the-art performance of each task and discuss how we can improve the performance. Challenges and future directions are addressed, highlighting the importance of several topics, such as domain-specific charts, lack of efforts in developing evaluation metrics, and agent-oriented settings. This survey paper serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners in the fields of natural language processing, computer vision, and data analysis, providing valuable insights and directions for future research in chart understanding leveraging large foundation models.

This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.</p></details> |  |

The majority of these systems are developed with modular sub-components for decision-making, planning, and control that may be hand-engineered or learning-based. While these existing approaches have been shown to perform well under the situations they were specifically designed for, they can perform especially poorly in rare, out-of-distribution scenarios that will undoubtedly arise at test-time. The rise of foundation models trained on multiple tasks with impressively large datasets from a variety of fields has led researchers to believe that these models may provide common sense reasoning that existing planners are missing. Researchers posit that this common sense reasoning will bridge the gap between algorithm development and deployment to out-of-distribution tasks, like how humans adapt to unexpected scenarios. Large language models have already penetrated the robotics and autonomous systems domains as researchers are scrambling to showcase their potential use cases in deployment. While this application direction is very promising empirically, foundation models are known to hallucinate and generate decisions that may sound reasonable, but are in fact poor. We argue there is a need to step back and simultaneously design systems that can quantify the certainty of a model's decision, and detect when it may be hallucinating. In this work, we discuss the current use cases of foundation models for decision-making tasks, provide a general definition for hallucinations with examples, discuss existing approaches to hallucination detection and mitigation with a focus on decision problems, and explore areas for further research in this exciting field.</p></details> | 31 pages, 2 tables |

Despite the predominant focus on pretraining pathological foundation models, how to adapt foundation models to downstream tasks is little explored. For downstream adaptation, we propose the existence of two domain gaps, i.e., the Foundation-Task Gap and the Task-Instance Gap. To mitigate these gaps, we introduce PathoTune, a framework designed to efficiently adapt pathological or even visual foundation models to pathology-specific tasks via multi-modal prompt tuning. The proposed framework leverages Task-specific Visual Prompts and Task-specific Textual Prompts to identify task-relevant features, along with Instance-specific Visual Prompts for encoding single pathological image features. Results across multiple datasets at both patch-level and WSI-level demonstrate its superior performance over single-modality prompt tuning approaches. Significantly, PathoTune facilitates the direct adaptation of natural visual foundation models to pathological tasks, drastically outperforming pathological foundation models with simple linear probing.

Many previous methods attempted to solve this task by relying on supervised or reinforcement learning, where they are trained on limited household datasets with close-set objects. However, two key challenges are unsolved: understanding free-form natural language instructions that demand open-set objects, and generalizing to new environments in a zero-shot manner. Aiming to solve the two challenges, in this paper, we propose OpenFMNav, an Open-set Foundation Model based framework for zero-shot object Navigation. We first unleash the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs) to extract proposed objects from natural language instructions that meet the user's demand. We then leverage the generalizability of large vision language models (VLMs) to actively discover and detect candidate objects from the scene, building a Versatile Semantic Score Map (VSSM). Then, by conducting common sense reasoning on VSSM, our method can perform effective language-guided exploration and exploitation of the scene and finally reach the goal. By leveraging the reasoning and generalizing abilities of foundation models, our method can understand free-form human instructions and perform effective open-set zero-shot navigation in diverse environments. Extensive experiments on the HM3D ObjectNav benchmark show that our method surpasses all the strong baselines on all metrics, proving our method's effectiveness. Furthermore, we perform real robot demonstrations to validate our method's open-set-ness and generalizability to real-world environments.</p></details> | NAACL 2024 Findings |

There is a wide variety of knowledge patterns embedded in the structure and properties of graphs which may be used for pre-training, but we lack a systematic overview of self-supervised pre-training tasks from the perspective of graph knowledge. In this paper, we comprehensively survey and analyze the pre-training tasks of graph foundation models from a knowledge-based perspective, consisting of microscopic (nodes, links, etc) and macroscopic knowledge (clusters, global structure, etc). It covers a total of 9 knowledge categories and 25 pre-training tasks, as well as various downstream task adaptation strategies.

Our approach employs a progressive training paradigm that unifies the different self- or weakly-supervised learning frameworks of masked video token reconstruction, cross-modal contrastive learning, and next token prediction. Different training stages would guide our model to capture different levels of structure and semantic information through different pretext tasks. At the data level, we prioritize the spatiotemporal consistency by semantically segmenting videos and generating video-audio-speech captions. This improves the alignment between video and text. We scale both data and model size for our InternVideo2. Through extensive experiments, we validate our designs and demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance on over 60 video and audio tasks. Notably, our model outperforms others on various video-related captioning, dialogue, and long video understanding benchmarks, highlighting its ability to reason and comprehend long temporal contexts.

Traditional models have been siloed, tailored to specific sensors or data types like optical, radar, and hyperspectral, each with its own unique characteristics. This specialization hinders the potential for a holistic analysis that could benefit from the combined strengths of these diverse data sources. Our novel approach introduces the Dynamic One-For-All (DOFA) model, leveraging the concept of neural plasticity in brain science to integrate various data modalities into a single framework adaptively. This dynamic hypernetwork, adjusting to different wavelengths, enables a single versatile Transformer jointly trained on data from five sensors to excel across 12 distinct Earth observation tasks, including sensors never seen during pretraining. DOFA's innovative design offers a promising leap towards more accurate, efficient, and unified Earth observation analysis, showcasing remarkable adaptability and performance in harnessing the potential of multimodal Earth observation data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 10 figures |
| **[SkySense: A Multi-Modal Remote Sensing Foundation Model Towards Universal Interpretation for Earth Observation Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10115v2)** | 2024-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior studies on Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) reveal immense potential towards a generic model for Earth Observation. Nevertheless, these works primarily focus on a single modality without temporal and geo-context modeling, hampering their capabilities for diverse tasks. In this study, we present SkySense, a generic billion-scale model, pre-trained on a curated multi-modal Remote Sensing Imagery (RSI) dataset with 21.5 million temporal sequences. SkySense incorporates a factorized multi-modal spatiotemporal encoder taking temporal sequences of optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data as input. This encoder is pre-trained by our proposed Multi-Granularity Contrastive Learning to learn representations across different modal and spatial granularities. To further enhance the RSI representations by the geo-context clue, we introduce Geo-Context Prototype Learning to learn region-aware prototypes upon RSI's multi-modal spatiotemporal features. To our best knowledge, SkySense is the largest Multi-Modal RSFM to date, whose modules can be flexibly combined or used individually to accommodate various tasks. It demonstrates remarkable generalization capabilities on a thorough evaluation encompassing 16 datasets over 7 tasks, from single- to multi-modal, static to temporal, and classification to localization. SkySense surpasses 18 recent RSFMs in all test scenarios. Specifically, it outperforms the latest models such as GFM, SatLas and Scale-MAE by a large margin, i.e., 2.76%, 3.67% and 3.61% on average respectively. We will release the pre-trained weights to facilitate future research and Earth Observation applications.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2024 |

| **[TensorBank: Tensor Lakehouse for Foundation Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02094v3)** | 2024-03-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Storing and streaming high dimensional data for foundation model training became a critical requirement with the rise of foundation models beyond natural language. In this paper we introduce TensorBank, a petabyte scale tensor lakehouse capable of streaming tensors from Cloud Object Store (COS) to GPU memory at wire speed based on complex relational queries. We use Hierarchical Statistical Indices (HSI) for query acceleration. Our architecture allows to directly address tensors on block level using HTTP range reads. Once in GPU memory, data can be transformed using PyTorch transforms. We provide a generic PyTorch dataset type with a corresponding dataset factory translating relational queries and requested transformations as an instance. By making use of the HSI, irrelevant blocks can be skipped without reading them as those indices contain statistics on their content at different hierarchical resolution levels. This is an opinionated architecture powered by open standards and making heavy use of open-source technology. Although, hardened for production use using geospatial-temporal data, this architecture generalizes to other use case like computer vision, computational neuroscience, biological sequence analysis and more.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the need for efficient spatial understanding in robotics, EPG provides a compact yet powerful approach by attaching foundation model features to the nodes of a pose graph. Unlike traditional methods that rely on bulky data formats like voxel grids or point clouds, EPG is lightweight and scalable. It facilitates a range of robotic tasks, including open-vocabulary querying, disambiguation, image-based querying, language-directed navigation, and re-localization in 3D environments. We showcase the effectiveness of EPG in handling these tasks, demonstrating its capacity to improve how robots interact with and navigate through complex spaces. Through both qualitative and quantitative assessments, we illustrate EPG's strong performance and its ability to outperform existing methods in re-localization. Our work introduces a crucial step forward in enabling robots to efficiently understand and operate within large-scale 3D spaces.</p></details> |  |

Pretraining is an active research topic, encompassing supervised and self-supervised learning methods to initialize model weights effectively. However, transferring the pretrained models to downstream tasks may encounter task discrepancy due to their formulation of pretraining as image classification or object discrimination tasks. In this study, we explore the Multi-Task Pretraining (MTP) paradigm for RS foundation models to address this issue. Using a shared encoder and task-specific decoder architecture, we conduct multi-task supervised pretraining on the SAMRS dataset, encompassing semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and rotated object detection. MTP supports both convolutional neural networks and vision transformer foundation models with over 300 million parameters. The pretrained models are finetuned on various RS downstream tasks, such as scene classification, horizontal and rotated object detection, semantic segmentation, and change detection. Extensive experiments across 14 datasets demonstrate the superiority of our models over existing ones of similar size and their competitive performance compared to larger state-of-the-art models, thus validating the effectiveness of MTP.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The codes and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/ViTAE-Transformer/MTP</p></details> |

However, this advantage introduces a significant trade-off between diversity and correctness. In software engineering tasks, diversity is key to exploring design spaces and fostering creativity, but the practical value of these solutions is heavily dependent on their correctness. Our study systematically investigates this trade-off using experiments with HumanEval tasks, exploring various parameter settings and prompting strategies. We assess the diversity of code solutions using similarity metrics from the code clone community. The study identifies combinations of parameters and strategies that strike an optimal balance between diversity and correctness, situated on the Pareto front of this trade-off space. These findings offer valuable insights for software engineers on how to effectively use AI foundation models to generate code solutions that are diverse and accurate.</p></details> | 4 pages,Forge 2024 |

However, optimizing FMs often requires access to sensitive data, raising privacy concerns and limiting their applicability in many domains. In this paper, we propose the Federated Foundation Models (FFMs) paradigm, which combines the benefits of FMs and Federated Learning (FL) to enable privacy-preserving and collaborative learning across multiple end-users. We discuss the potential benefits and challenges of integrating FL into the lifespan of FMs, covering pre-training, fine-tuning, and application. We further outline potential future research avenues in FFM, including FFM pre-training, FFM fine-tuning, and federated prompt tuning, which allow the development of more personalized and context-aware models while ensuring data privacy. Moreover, we explore the possibility of continual/lifelong learning in FFMs, as increased computational power at the edge may unlock the potential for optimizing FMs using newly generated private data close to the data source. The proposed FFM concepts offer a flexible and scalable framework for training large language models in a privacy-preserving manner, setting the stage for subsequent advancements in both FM training and federated learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2024 Joint International Conference on Computational Linguistics, Language Resources and Evaluation (LREC-COLING 2024)</p></details> |
| **[As Firm As Their Foundations: Can open-sourced foundation models be used to create adversarial examples for downstream tasks?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12693v1)** | 2024-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained on web-scale vision-language data, such as CLIP, are widely used as cornerstones of powerful machine learning systems. While pre-training offers clear advantages for downstream learning, it also endows downstream models with shared adversarial vulnerabilities that can be easily identified through the open-sourced foundation model. In this work, we expose such vulnerabilities in CLIP's downstream models and show that foundation models can serve as a basis for attacking their downstream systems. In particular, we propose a simple yet effective adversarial attack strategy termed Patch Representation Misalignment (PRM). Solely based on open-sourced CLIP vision encoders, this method produces adversaries that simultaneously fool more than 20 downstream models spanning 4 common vision-language tasks (semantic segmentation, object detection, image captioning and visual question-answering). Our findings highlight the concerning safety risks introduced by the extensive usage of public foundational models in the development of downstream systems, calling for extra caution in these scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we focus on widely employed assumptions for causal discovery when objects of interest are (multivariate) groups of random variables rather than individual (univariate) random variables, as is the case in a variety of problems in scientific domains such as climate science or neuroscience. If the group-level causal models are derived from partitioning a micro-level model into groups, we explore the relationship between micro and group-level causal discovery assumptions. We investigate the conditions under which assumptions like Causal Faithfulness hold or fail to hold. Our analysis encompasses graphical causal models that contain cycles and bidirected edges. We also discuss grouped time series causal graphs and variants thereof as special cases of our general theoretical framework. Thereby, we aim to provide researchers with a solid theoretical foundation for the development and application of causal discovery methods for variable groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version, minor restructuring.

Monitoring and analyzing network traffic is crucial for ensuring the performance, security, and reliability of a network. However, a significant challenge in network traffic analysis is to process diverse data packets including both ciphertext and plaintext. While many methods have been adopted to analyze network traffic, they often rely on different datasets for performance evaluation. This inconsistency results in substantial manual data processing efforts and unfair comparisons. Moreover, some data processing methods may cause data leakage due to improper separation of training and testing data. To address these issues, we introduce the NetBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark dataset for assessing machine learning models, especially foundation models, in both network traffic classification and generation tasks. NetBench is built upon seven publicly available datasets and encompasses a broad spectrum of 20 tasks, including 15 classification tasks and 5 generation tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate eight State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) classification models (including two foundation models) and two generative models using our benchmark. The results show that foundation models significantly outperform the traditional deep learning methods in traffic classification. We believe NetBench will facilitate fair comparisons among various approaches and advance the development of foundation models for network traffic. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/WM-JayLab/NetBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[DNABERT-2: Efficient Foundation Model and Benchmark For Multi-Species Genome](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.15006v2)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding the linguistic intricacies of the genome is a crucial problem in biology, and pre-trained foundational models such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer have made significant strides in this area. Existing works have largely hinged on k-mer, fixed-length permutations of A, T, C, and G, as the token of the genome language due to its simplicity. However, we argue that the computation and sample inefficiencies introduced by k-mer tokenization are primary obstacles in developing large genome foundational models. We provide conceptual and empirical insights into genome tokenization, building on which we propose to replace k-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a statistics-based data compression algorithm that constructs tokens by iteratively merging the most frequent co-occurring genome segment in the corpus. We demonstrate that BPE not only overcomes the limitations of k-mer tokenization but also benefits from the computational efficiency of non-overlapping tokenization. Based on these insights, we introduce DNABERT-2, a refined genome foundation model that adapts an efficient tokenizer and employs multiple strategies to overcome input length constraints, reduce time and memory expenditure, and enhance model capability. Furthermore, we identify the absence of a comprehensive and standardized benchmark for genome understanding as another significant impediment to fair comparative analysis. In response, we propose the Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE), a comprehensive multi-species genome classification dataset that amalgamates $36$ distinct datasets across $9$ tasks, with input lengths ranging from $70$ to $10000$. Through comprehensive experiments on the GUE benchmark, we demonstrate that DNABERT-2 achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model with $21 \times$ fewer parameters and approximately $92 \times$ less GPU time in pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Transferring Foundation Models for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05716v4)** | 2024-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improving the generalization capabilities of general-purpose robotic manipulation agents in the real world has long been a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on collecting large-scale robotic data which is costly and time-consuming, such as the RT-1 dataset. However, due to insufficient diversity of data, these approaches typically suffer from limiting their capability in open-domain scenarios with new objects and diverse environments. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm that effectively leverages language-reasoning segmentation mask generated by internet-scale foundation models, to condition robot manipulation tasks. By integrating the mask modality, which incorporates semantic, geometric, and temporal correlation priors derived from vision foundation models, into the end-to-end policy model, our approach can effectively and robustly perceive object pose and enable sample-efficient generalization learning, including new object instances, semantic categories, and unseen backgrounds. We first introduce a series of foundation models to ground natural language demands across multiple tasks. Secondly, we develop a two-stream 2D policy model based on imitation learning, which processes raw images and object masks to predict robot actions with a local-global perception manner. Extensive realworld experiments conducted on a Franka Emika robot arm demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed paradigm and policy architecture. Demos can be found in our submitted video, and more comprehensive ones can be found in link1 or link2.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we propose the first TTT method for 3D semantic segmentation, TTT-KD, which models Knowledge Distillation (KD) from foundation models (e.g. DINOv2) as a self-supervised objective for adaptation to distribution shifts at test-time. Given access to paired image-pointcloud (2D-3D) data, we first optimize a 3D segmentation backbone for the main task of semantic segmentation using the pointclouds and the task of 2D $\to$ 3D KD by using an off-the-shelf 2D pre-trained foundation model. At test-time, our TTT-KD updates the 3D segmentation backbone for each test sample, by using the self-supervised task of knowledge distillation, before performing the final prediction. Extensive evaluations on multiple indoor and outdoor 3D segmentation benchmarks show the utility of TTT-KD, as it improves performance for both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (ODO) test datasets. We achieve a gain of up to 13% mIoU (7% on average) when the train and test distributions are similar and up to 45% (20% on average) when adapting to OOD test samples.</p></details> |  |

Despite previous attempts to decode face recognition features into detailed images, we find that common high-resolution datasets (e.g. FFHQ) lack sufficient identities to reconstruct any subject. To that end, we meticulously upsample a significant portion of the WebFace42M database, the largest public dataset for face recognition (FR). Arc2Face builds upon a pretrained Stable Diffusion model, yet adapts it to the task of ID-to-face generation, conditioned solely on ID vectors. Deviating from recent works that combine ID with text embeddings for zero-shot personalization of text-to-image models, we emphasize on the compactness of FR features, which can fully capture the essence of the human face, as opposed to hand-crafted prompts. Crucially, text-augmented models struggle to decouple identity and text, usually necessitating some description of the given face to achieve satisfactory similarity. Arc2Face, however, only needs the discriminative features of ArcFace to guide the generation, offering a robust prior for a plethora of tasks where ID consistency is of paramount importance. As an example, we train a FR model on synthetic images from our model and achieve superior performance to existing synthetic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 20 figures.

Existing techniques tend to be specialized in individual scenarios and lack generalization capacities. In this study, we aim to develop a generic anomaly detection model applicable across multiple scenarios. To achieve this, we customize generic visual-language foundation models that possess extensive knowledge and robust reasoning abilities into anomaly detectors and reasoners. Specifically, we introduce a multi-modal prompting strategy that incorporates domain knowledge from experts as conditions to guide the models. Our approach considers multi-modal prompt types, including task descriptions, class context, normality rules, and reference images. In addition, we unify the input representation of multi-modality into a 2D image format, enabling multi-modal anomaly detection and reasoning. Our preliminary studies demonstrate that combining visual and language prompts as conditions for customizing the models enhances anomaly detection performance. The customized models showcase the ability to detect anomalies across different data modalities such as images and point clouds. Qualitative case studies further highlight the anomaly detection and reasoning capabilities, particularly for multi-object scenes and temporal data.

| **[Universal Debiased Editing on Foundation Models for Fair Medical Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06104v2)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of Foundation Models' (FMs) rising prominence in AI, our study addresses the challenge of biases in medical images while using FM API, particularly spurious correlations between pixels and sensitive attributes. Traditional methods for bias mitigation face limitations due to the restricted access to web-hosted FMs and difficulties in addressing the underlying bias encoded within the FM API. We propose an U(niversal) D(ebiased) E(diting) strategy, termed UDE, which generates UDE noise to mask such spurious correlation. UDE is capable of mitigating bias both within the FM API embedding and the images themselves. Furthermore, UDE is suitable for both white-box and black-box FM APIs, where we introduced G(reedy) (Z)eroth-O(rder) (GeZO) optimization for it when the gradient is inaccessible in black-box APIs. Our whole pipeline enables fairness-aware image editing that can be applied across various medical contexts without requiring direct model manipulation or significant computational resources. Our empirical results demonstrate the method's effectiveness in maintaining fairness and utility across different patient groups and diseases. In the era of AI-driven medicine, this work contributes to making healthcare diagnostics more equitable, showcasing a practical solution for bias mitigation in pre-trained image FMs.</p></details> |  |

However, the contradiction between the growing demand for high-quality annotated data with patient privacy continues to intensify. The utilization of medical artificial intelligence generated content (Med-AIGC) as an inexhaustible resource repository arises as a potential solution to address the aforementioned challenge. Here we harness 1 million open-source synthetic fundus images paired with natural language descriptions, to curate an ethical language-image foundation model for retina image analysis named VisionCLIP. VisionCLIP achieves competitive performance on three external datasets compared with the existing method pre-trained on real-world data in a zero-shot fashion. The employment of artificially synthetic images alongside corresponding textual data for training enables the medical foundation model to successfully assimilate knowledge of disease symptomatology, thereby circumventing potential breaches of patient confidentiality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Active Label Correction for Semantic Segmentation with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10820v1)** | 2024-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training and validating models for semantic segmentation require datasets with pixel-wise annotations, which are notoriously labor-intensive. Although useful priors such as foundation models or crowdsourced datasets are available, they are error-prone. We hence propose an effective framework of active label correction (ALC) based on a design of correction query to rectify pseudo labels of pixels, which in turn is more annotator-friendly than the standard one inquiring to classify a pixel directly according to our theoretical analysis and user study. Specifically, leveraging foundation models providing useful zero-shot predictions on pseudo labels and superpixels, our method comprises two key techniques: (i) an annotator-friendly design of correction query with the pseudo labels, and (ii) an acquisition function looking ahead label expansions based on the superpixels. Experimental results on PASCAL, Cityscapes, and Kvasir-SEG datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our ALC framework, outperforming prior methods for active semantic segmentation and label correction. Notably, utilizing our method, we obtained a revised dataset of PASCAL by rectifying errors in 2.6 million pixels in PASCAL dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Zero-Shot Robustness of Multimodal Foundation Models: A Pilot Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10499v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-training image representations from the raw text about images enables zero-shot vision transfer to downstream tasks. Through pre-training on millions of samples collected from the internet, multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, produce state-of-the-art zero-shot results that often reach competitiveness with fully supervised methods without the need for task-specific training. Besides the encouraging performance on classification accuracy, it is reported that these models close the robustness gap by matching the performance of supervised models trained on ImageNet under natural distribution shift. Because robustness is critical to real-world applications, especially safety-critical ones, in this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation based on a large-scale robustness benchmark covering 7 natural, 3 synthetic distribution shifts, and 11 adversarial attacks. We use CLIP as a pilot study. We show that CLIP leads to a significant robustness drop compared to supervised ImageNet models on our benchmark, especially under synthetic distribution shift and adversarial attacks. Furthermore, data overlap analysis suggests that the observed robustness under natural distribution shifts could be attributed, at least in part, to data overlap. In summary, our evaluation shows a comprehensive evaluation of robustness is necessary; and there is a significant need to improve the robustness of zero-shot multimodal models.</p></details> |  |

The current machine vision model requires a large volume of data to achieve high performance. However, there are approximately 5.5 million different insect species in the world. None of the existing insect datasets can cover even a fraction of them due to varying geographic locations and acquisition costs. In this paper, we introduce a novel "Insect-1M" dataset, a game-changing resource poised to revolutionize insect-related foundation model training. Covering a vast spectrum of insect species, our dataset, including 1 million images with dense identification labels of taxonomy hierarchy and insect descriptions, offers a panoramic view of entomology, enabling foundation models to comprehend visual and semantic information about insects like never before. Then, to efficiently establish an Insect Foundation Model, we develop a micro-feature self-supervised learning method with a Patch-wise Relevant Attention mechanism capable of discerning the subtle differences among insect images. In addition, we introduce Description Consistency loss to improve micro-feature modeling via insect descriptions.

| **[TransLandSeg: A Transfer Learning Approach for Landslide Semantic Segmentation Based on Vision Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10127v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Landslides are one of the most destructive natural disasters in the world, posing a serious threat to human life and safety. The development of foundation models has provided a new research paradigm for large-scale landslide detection. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has garnered widespread attention in the field of image segmentation. However, our experiment found that SAM performed poorly in the task of landslide segmentation. We propose TransLandSeg, which is a transfer learning approach for landslide semantic segmentation based on a vision foundation model (VFM). TransLandSeg outperforms traditional semantic segmentation models on both the Landslide4Sense dataset and the Bijie landslide dataset. Our proposed adaptive transfer learning (ATL) architecture enables the powerful segmentation capability of SAM to be transferred to landslide detection by training only 1.3% of the number of the parameters of SAM, which greatly improves the training efficiency of the model. Finally we also conducted ablation experiments on models with different ATL structures, concluded that the deployment location and residual connection of ATL play an important role in TransLandSeg accuracy improvement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Foundation Models Boost Cross-Modal Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10001v1)** | 2024-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) is vital for alleviating the workload of labeling 3D point cloud data and mitigating the absence of labels when facing a newly defined domain. Various methods of utilizing images to enhance the performance of cross-domain 3D segmentation have recently emerged. However, the pseudo labels, which are generated from models trained on the source domain and provide additional supervised signals for the unseen domain, are inadequate when utilized for 3D segmentation due to their inherent noisiness and consequently restrict the accuracy of neural networks. With the advent of 2D visual foundation models (VFMs) and their abundant knowledge prior, we propose a novel pipeline VFMSeg to further enhance the cross-modal unsupervised domain adaptation framework by leveraging these models. In this work, we study how to harness the knowledge priors learned by VFMs to produce more accurate labels for unlabeled target domains and improve overall performance. We first utilize a multi-modal VFM, which is pre-trained on large scale image-text pairs, to provide supervised labels (VFM-PL) for images and point clouds from the target domain. Then, another VFM trained on fine-grained 2D masks is adopted to guide the generation of semantically augmented images and point clouds to enhance the performance of neural networks, which mix the data from source and target domains like view frustums (FrustumMixing). Finally, we merge class-wise prediction across modalities to produce more accurate annotations for unlabeled target domains. Our method is evaluated on various autonomous driving datasets and the results demonstrate a significant improvement for 3D segmentation task.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

As a data-centric artificial intelligence paradigm, GFMs extract valuable insights from petabytes of both structured and unstructured data. Their versatility in task specification, diverse inputs and outputs, and multi-modal knowledge representation enable a comprehensive analysis that surpasses the capabilities of individual data sources. Critically, the scalability and generalizability of GFMs empower them to address a wide array of prediction, simulation, and decision tasks related to the intricate interactions among Earth system components. By unraveling the causal mechanisms underlying observed patterns and changes, GFMs contribute to advancing our knowledge of the Earth system and its responses to various drivers and perturbations. Collaboration between domain experts and computer scientists plays a pivotal role in fostering innovations in these invaluable tools for understanding the past, present, and future of our planet. Moreover, we introduce recent advances including key technologies for constructing GFMs, especially remote sensing applications. However, challenges remain in validation and verification, scalability, interpretability, knowledge representation, and addressing social bias. Going forward, the key lies in enhancing model integration, resolution, accuracy, and equity through interdisciplinary teamwork. Despite current limitations, GFMs hold great promise for providing critical insights into pressing issues including climate change, natural hazards, and sustainability through their ability to explore multiple scenarios and quantify uncertainties. Their continued evolution toward integrated, data-driven modeling holds paradigm-shifting potential for Earth science.</p></details> | <details><summary>the m...</summary><p>the manuscript is under re-writing</p></details> |
| **[Symbiotic Game and Foundation Models for Cyber Deception Operations in Strategic Cyber Warfare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10570v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are currently facing unprecedented cyber warfare with the rapid evolution of tactics, increasing asymmetry of intelligence, and the growing accessibility of hacking tools. In this landscape, cyber deception emerges as a critical component of our defense strategy against increasingly sophisticated attacks. This chapter aims to highlight the pivotal role of game-theoretic models and foundation models (FMs) in analyzing, designing, and implementing cyber deception tactics. Game models (GMs) serve as a foundational framework for modeling diverse adversarial interactions, allowing us to encapsulate both adversarial knowledge and domain-specific insights. Meanwhile, FMs serve as the building blocks for creating tailored machine learning models suited to given applications. By leveraging the synergy between GMs and FMs, we can advance proactive and automated cyber defense mechanisms by not only securing our networks against attacks but also enhancing their resilience against well-planned operations. This chapter discusses the games at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of warfare, delves into the symbiotic relationship between these methodologies, and explores relevant applications where such a framework can make a substantial impact in cybersecurity. The chapter discusses the promising direction of the multi-agent neurosymbolic conjectural learning (MANSCOL), which allows the defender to predict adversarial behaviors, design adaptive defensive deception tactics, and synthesize knowledge for the operational level synthesis and adaptation. FMs serve as pivotal tools across various functions for MANSCOL, including reinforcement learning, knowledge assimilation, formation of conjectures, and contextual representation. This chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges associated with FMs and their application in the domain of cybersecurity.</p></details> |  |
| **[OneTracker: Unifying Visual Object Tracking with Foundation Models and Efficient Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09634v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual object tracking aims to localize the target object of each frame based on its initial appearance in the first frame. Depending on the input modility, tracking tasks can be divided into RGB tracking and RGB+X (e.g. RGB+N, and RGB+D) tracking. Despite the different input modalities, the core aspect of tracking is the temporal matching. Based on this common ground, we present a general framework to unify various tracking tasks, termed as OneTracker. OneTracker first performs a large-scale pre-training on a RGB tracker called Foundation Tracker. This pretraining phase equips the Foundation Tracker with a stable ability to estimate the location of the target object. Then we regard other modality information as prompt and build Prompt Tracker upon Foundation Tracker. Through freezing the Foundation Tracker and only adjusting some additional trainable parameters, Prompt Tracker inhibits the strong localization ability from Foundation Tracker and achieves parameter-efficient finetuning on downstream RGB+X tracking tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our general framework OneTracker, which is consisted of Foundation Tracker and Prompt Tracker, we conduct extensive experiments on 6 popular tracking tasks across 11 benchmarks and our OneTracker outperforms other models and achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2024</p></details> |
| **[Me LLaMA: Foundation Large Language Models for Medical Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12749v3)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and LLaMA have shown great promise in many AI applications. However, their performance on medical tasks is suboptimal and can be improved by training on extensive domain-specific datasets. This study introduces Me LLaMA, a medical LLM family that includes foundation models - Me LLaMA 13/70B, along with their chat-enhanced versions - Me LLaMA 13/70B-chat, developed through continual pre-training and instruction tuning of LLaMA2 using large medical datasets. Our domain-specific data suite for training and evaluation includes a large-scale, continual pre-training dataset with 129B tokens, an instruction tuning dataset with 214k samples, and a new medical evaluation benchmark (MIBE) across six tasks with 12 datasets. Our extensive evaluation using the MIBE shows that Me LLaMA models achieve overall better performance than existing open-source medical LLMs in zero-shot, few-shot and supervised learning abilities. Their zero-shot performance is comparable with ChatGPT across 7 out of 8 datasets, with a slight variance of within 3%, and yet falls short when compared to GPT-4. In addition, we investigated the catastrophic forgetting problem, and our results show that Me LLaMA models outperform other open-source medical LLMs in mitigating this issue. Me LLaMA is one of the largest open-source medical foundation LLMs that use both biomedical and clinical data. It exhibits superior performance across both general and medical tasks compared to other open-source medical LLMs, rendering it an attractive choice for medical AI applications. We release our models, datasets, and evaluation scripts at: https://github.com/BIDS-Xu-Lab/Me-LLaMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[Annotation Free Semantic Segmentation with Vision Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09307v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Segmentation is one of the most challenging vision tasks, usually requiring large amounts of training data with expensive pixel-level annotations. With the success of foundation models and especially vision-language models, recent works attempt to achieve zero-shot semantic segmentation while requiring either large scale training or additional image/pixel-level annotations. In this work, we build a lightweight module on top of a self-supervised pretrained vision encoder to align patch features with a pre-trained text encoder. Importantly, we generate free annotations for any semantic segmentation dataset using existing foundation models and train our alignment module cost free. We use CLIP to detect objects and SAM to generate high quality object masks. Our approach can bring language-based semantics to any pre-trained vision encoder with minimal training. Our module is lightweight, uses foundation models as a sole source of supervision and shows impressive generalization capability from little training data with no annotation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Customizing Segmentation Foundation Model via Prompt Learning for Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09199v1)** | 2024-03-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, foundation models trained on massive datasets to adapt to a wide range of domains have attracted considerable attention and are actively being explored within the computer vision community. Among these, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands out for its remarkable progress in generalizability and flexibility for image segmentation tasks, achieved through prompt-based object mask generation. However, despite its strength, SAM faces two key limitations when applied to customized instance segmentation that segments specific objects or those in unique environments not typically present in the training data: 1) the ambiguity inherent in input prompts and 2) the necessity for extensive additional training to achieve optimal segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method, customized instance segmentation via prompt learning tailored to SAM. Our method involves a prompt learning module (PLM), which adjusts input prompts into the embedding space to better align with user intentions, thereby enabling more efficient training. Furthermore, we introduce a point matching module (PMM) to enhance the feature representation for finer segmentation by ensuring detailed alignment with ground truth boundaries. Experimental results on various customized instance segmentation scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Medical Multimodal-Multitask Foundation Model for Superior Chest CT Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02649v2)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Patient management requires multitasking interaction with multimodal data. While today's AI, particularly large foundation models, promises unprecedented opportunities, progress remains relatively slow in developing medical multimodal multitask foundation models. There are two main challenges along this direction: the data challenge -- the high bar to curate medical multimodal multitask datasets including 3D medical tomographic images in alignment with other clinical datasets, and the model challenge -- the unavailability of a scalable and adaptable foundation model architecture to synergize multimodal datasets for diverse clinical tasks. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind medical multimodal-multitask foundation model (M3FM) with an emphasis on lung cancer screening. To train our M3FM, we first curated a comprehensive multimodal multitask dataset consisting of 163,725 3D chest CT exams, 48 clinical data types, and 17 medical tasks on lung, heart, and other chest diseases. Then, we created and applied a multimodal question-answering framework as a unified training strategy to effectively integrate multimodal information and naturally perform multiple tasks with free-text prompting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that M3FM consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models. M3FM can identify informative multimodal data elements that are relevant to specific clinical tasks, being instrumental in building AI models and gaining insights into correlations among multimodal data and diseases. M3FM can be adapted to boost the performance of new tasks with a small out-of-distribution dataset. M3FM has enabled superior volumetric CT imaging performance for lung cancer screening, cardiac disease prediction, and other CT-related tasks. M3FM can be extended to incorporate more data types and improve other medical tasks, towards AI-empowered precise and efficient medicine.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we proposed a large-scale foundation model(LSFM)-based IHAR method, wherein various LSFMs and lightweight methods were jointly used, for the first time, to fulfill low-cost dataset establishment and real-time IHARs. Comprehensive tests on in-situ large-scale industrial manufacturing lines elucidated that the proposed method realized great reduction on employment costs, superior real-time performance, and satisfactory accuracy and generalization capabilities, indicating its great potential as a backbone IHAR method, especially for large-scale industrial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source-Free Domain Adaptation with Frozen Multimodal Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16510v3)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) aims to adapt a source model for a target domain, with only access to unlabeled target training data and the source model pre-trained on a supervised source domain. Relying on pseudo labeling and/or auxiliary supervision, conventional methods are inevitably error-prone. To mitigate this limitation, in this work we for the first time explore the potentials of off-the-shelf vision-language (ViL) multimodal models (e.g.,CLIP) with rich whilst heterogeneous knowledge. We find that directly applying the ViL model to the target domain in a zero-shot fashion is unsatisfactory, as it is not specialized for this particular task but largely generic. To make it task specific, we propose a novel Distilling multimodal Foundation model(DIFO)approach. Specifically, DIFO alternates between two steps during adaptation: (i) Customizing the ViL model by maximizing the mutual information with the target model in a prompt learning manner, (ii) Distilling the knowledge of this customized ViL model to the target model. For more fine-grained and reliable distillation, we further introduce two effective regularization terms, namely most-likely category encouragement and predictive consistency. Extensive experiments show that DIFO significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art alternatives.

| **[CoPa: General Robotic Manipulation through Spatial Constraints of Parts with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08248v1)** | 2024-03-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models pre-trained on web-scale data are shown to encapsulate extensive world knowledge beneficial for robotic manipulation in the form of task planning. However, the actual physical implementation of these plans often relies on task-specific learning methods, which require significant data collection and struggle with generalizability. In this work, we introduce Robotic Manipulation through Spatial Constraints of Parts (CoPa), a novel framework that leverages the common sense knowledge embedded within foundation models to generate a sequence of 6-DoF end-effector poses for open-world robotic manipulation. Specifically, we decompose the manipulation process into two phases: task-oriented grasping and task-aware motion planning. In the task-oriented grasping phase, we employ foundation vision-language models (VLMs) to select the object's grasping part through a novel coarse-to-fine grounding mechanism. During the task-aware motion planning phase, VLMs are utilized again to identify the spatial geometry constraints of task-relevant object parts, which are then used to derive post-grasp poses. We also demonstrate how CoPa can be seamlessly integrated with existing robotic planning algorithms to accomplish complex, long-horizon tasks. Our comprehensive real-world experiments show that CoPa possesses a fine-grained physical understanding of scenes, capable of handling open-set instructions and objects with minimal prompt engineering and without additional training.

| **[RudolfV: A Foundation Model by Pathologists for Pathologists](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04079v3)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology plays a central role in clinical medicine and biomedical research. While artificial intelligence shows promising results on many pathological tasks, generalization and dealing with rare diseases, where training data is scarce, remains a challenge. Distilling knowledge from unlabelled data into a foundation model before learning from, potentially limited, labelled data provides a viable path to address these challenges. In this work, we extend the state of the art of foundation models for digital pathology whole slide images by semi-automated data curation and incorporating pathologist domain knowledge. Specifically, we combine computational and pathologist domain knowledge (1) to curate a diverse dataset of 133k slides corresponding to 1.2 billion image patches covering data from different fixation, staining, and scanning protocols as well as data from different indications and labs across the EU and US, (2) for grouping semantically similar slides and tissue patches, and (3) to augment the input images during training. We evaluate the resulting model on a set of public and internal benchmarks and show that although our foundation model is trained with an order of magnitude less slides, it performs on par or better than competing models. We expect that scaling our approach to more data and larger models will further increase its performance and capacity to deal with increasingly complex real world tasks in diagnostics and biomedical research.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSBuilding: Towards General Remote Sensing Image Building Extraction and Change Detection with Foundation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07564v1)** | 2024-03-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The intelligent interpretation of buildings plays a significant role in urban planning and management, macroeconomic analysis, population dynamics, etc. Remote sensing image building interpretation primarily encompasses building extraction and change detection. However, current methodologies often treat these two tasks as separate entities, thereby failing to leverage shared knowledge. Moreover, the complexity and diversity of remote sensing image scenes pose additional challenges, as most algorithms are designed to model individual small datasets, thus lacking cross-scene generalization. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive remote sensing image building understanding model, termed RSBuilding, developed from the perspective of the foundation model. RSBuilding is designed to enhance cross-scene generalization and task universality. Specifically, we extract image features based on the prior knowledge of the foundation model and devise a multi-level feature sampler to augment scale information. To unify task representation and integrate image spatiotemporal clues, we introduce a cross-attention decoder with task prompts. Addressing the current shortage of datasets that incorporate annotations for both tasks, we have developed a federated training strategy to facilitate smooth model convergence even when supervision for some tasks is missing, thereby bolstering the complementarity of different tasks. Our model was trained on a dataset comprising up to 245,000 images and validated on multiple building extraction and change detection datasets. The experimental results substantiate that RSBuilding can concurrently handle two structurally distinct tasks and exhibits robust zero-shot generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
